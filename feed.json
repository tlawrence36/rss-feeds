    "story": [
      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",
      "\u201cI don't want to think about that,\u201d the person said.",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Jeezy released his commercial debut two decades ago, he prepared a contingency plan in case his musical aspirations weren\u2019t achieved.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",

      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",
      "JEEZY: I just live my life, man. You know, joy, peace, and freedom, brother. I don\u2019t know these people, so I can\u2019t even feel no type of way. That\u2019s on them \u2014 I got better things to do.

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "The champ is coming back to chomp.",
      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, efforts to market the bicycle have focused on supporting health workers like Abalo, who visits people\u2019s homes and reports any issues to authorities.",
      "As a community health extension worker, or CHEW, she has gained the trust of villagers, who can knock on her door in emergency situations. She said she helps to look after about 8,000 people in the area.",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",
      "The Buffalo Bicycle is a recent arrival. Many have never heard of it, or can't afford it. Retailing for roughly $200, it is three times more expensive than the cheapest regular bicycle \u2014 otherwise out of reach for many CHEWs, who do not yet earn a salary.",
      "The bike's promoters cite its durability in rough terrain, needing fewer trips to the mechanic as a way to save money.",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, and white people account for the vast majority of the deaths",
      "NEW YORK -- Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, according to a new federal report published Wednesday, with white people accounting for the vast majority of the deaths.",
      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "A federal court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from clawing back millions in public health funding from four Democrat-led municipalities in GOP-governed states.",
      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",

She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s expected to be okay,\u201d Newkirk told the TV station. \u201cHe\u2019s just fighting. We just want prayers for him.\"",
      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",
      "Newkirk said Smith would be taken off of life support Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press reached called and emailed Emory Tuesday for comment. It is unclear why Emory decided to deliver the baby. The Associated Press has also tried to contact Newkirk.",
      "Smith's family said Emory doctors told them they were not allowed to remove the devices keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 generally around six weeks into pregnancy.",
      "Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr later issued a statement saying the law did not require medical professionals to keep a woman declared brain dead on life support.",
      "\u201cRemoving life support is not an action \u2018with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,\u2019\u201d Carr said.",
      "Newkirk said Smith loved being a nurse at Emory. She also has a 7-year-old son. Her family celebrated her 31st birthday Sunday with several advocacy groups. Newkirk did not speak at the event.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m her mother,\u201d Newkirk told WXIA. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be burying my daughter. My daughter should be burying me.\u201d",

      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",
      "Alexis McGill-Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said it's almost been a challenge to fund abortion \u2014 and all health care \u2014 for low-income people.",
      "\u201cIf the market could have figured it out,\" she said, \"then we wouldn't exist.\u201d",

      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "Kraft Heinz said that many of its U.S. products that still use the FD&C colors are in its beverage and desserts categories, including certain products sold under brands including Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",

      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "Breaking down barriers surrounding mental health was a personal mission for Jim Irsay, the beloved owner of the Indianapolis Colts who passed away last month",
      "Breaking down barriers surrounding mental health was a personal mission for Jim Irsay, the beloved owner of the Indianapolis Colts who died last month at age 65.",
      "It\u2019s personal for Kalen Jackson, too.",
      "Irsay\u2019s youngest daughter, who joins sisters Carlie Irsay-Gordon and Casey Foyt in running the team, has talked openly about dealing with anxiety. Irsay-Gordon is the CEO with Foyt as executive vice president and Jackson chief brand officer.",
      "Jackson leads \u201cKicking The Stigma,\u201d the family\u2019s initiative to raise awareness about mental health disorders. The organization is committed to dismantling the stigma often associated with these illnesses and has been focused on expanding access to critical services across Indiana and nationwide.",
      "The Colts have donated more than $30 million to nonprofits and organizations in the mental health space since the initiative launched in 2020.",
      "\u201cThe stigma piece to me has almost become synonymous in my head with the way we handle it as a culture because the stigma comes from prejudice and judgment and that comes from how it\u2019s presented in our culture over time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHow do we change that conversation? With that will come so much of the change that we\u2019re fighting so hard to get to in terms of having more things covered (by) insurance or the way the hospital networks look at this, the way that companies look at this and supporting their employees.\u201d",
      "Irsay often spoke publicly about his battles with alcoholism and addiction, hoping his journey to sobriety would inspire and encourage others.",
      "Jackson\u2019s voice will continue to carry on the conversation.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of the legacy he has left behind and I only hope to make him proud,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "Jackson will be recognized by Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial and Gen Z-driven mental health tech nonprofit, for becoming a trailblazing leader in mental health advocacy. She will receive the organization\u2019s first \u201cSports Visionary of the Year\u201d Award at the third annual World Mental Health Day Gala on Oct. 9 in New York. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will present Jackson with the award at an event that\u2019s brought together celebrities, executives, and cultural leaders, including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.",
      "\u201cWhen we all got together to decide who should win this inaugural award, it was unanimous that it should be Kalen and the Colts because they have been so committed to mental health in sports,\u201d said Phillip Schermer, founder and CEO of Project Healthy Minds. \u201cIt\u2019s not talking the talk, it\u2019s walking the walk. They\u2019ve been doing this from the beginning and I think they\u2019ve sort of lit a path for what I think every sport and every league ought to do.\u201d",
      "For Jackson, who is on the nonprofit's Board of Directors, the mission is clear.",
      "\u201cTo connect with people and to be compassionate and to try to change the world for the better, that\u2019s kind of what all this is for me,\u201d she said.",
      "The NFL and NFL Players Association in 2019 agreed to make it a requirement to have a licensed behavioral health clinician on the staff of each team in an effort to increase mental health resources.",
      "The Colts have taken it further. They recently hired a clinician to also work with front-office staff and coaches.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to wait to know what impact it\u2019s going to have,\u201d Jackson said.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Some made their way to free Ukraine through Russia\u2019s southwestern Belgorod region, where the last open checkpoint between the two countries was located, the group says.",

      "The verdict against RFE/RL\u2019s Farid Mehralizada and six journalists from Abzas Media, an independent Azerbaijani investigative outlet, marks the latest escalation in the country's crackdown on media. All seven journalists have dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and international rights groups have called for their release.",
      "Mehralizada, a journalist with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani service and an economist, was sentenced to nine years in prison, RFE/RL reported. Nine-year sentences were also handed to Abzas Media's director Ulvi Hasanli, chief editor Sevinj Abbasova (Vagifqizi) and investigative journalist Hafiz Babali. Reporters Nargiz Absalamova and Elnara Gasimova were sentenced to eight years in prison, and deputy director Mahammad Kekelov \u2014 to 7 1/2 years, Abzas Media said.",
      "Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in a statement Friday condemned the sentences as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cthe outcome of a purely political trial based on fabricated charges, aimed at silencing voices that expose corruption and injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Azerbaijani authorities may imprison journalists, but they cannot imprison the truth,\" the group\u2019s editorial director Anne Bocand\u00e9 said. \u201cRSF calls for the immediate release of all Abzas Media defendants and urges international actors to intensify pressure on Baku.\u201d",

      "Mehralizada was arrested in May 2024 as part of the same case, even though both him and Abzas Media said that he never worked for the outlet. Later that year, authorities levied additional charges against Mehralizada and Azbas Media journalists, including illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, document forgery and others.",

Unfortunately, journalism in our country today is almost equated with terrorism.\u201d",
      "Weeks before Mehralizada's arrest, in March 2024, Azerbaijani authorities targeted another news outlet, Toplum TV, with raids and arrests on similar charges. In December 2024, Azerbaijani authorities arrested six more journalists on smuggling charges, including five of those working for the independent Meydan TV news outlet.",

      "KIGALI, Rwanda -- A prominent opposition leader in Rwanda has been arrested on charges she assisted an alleged plot to incite public unrest.",
      "Victoire Ingabire was arrested on Thursday and is being detained in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Her team of international lawyers in a statement called her arrest \u201cbaseless and politically motivated.\u201d",
      "The Rwanda Investigations Bureau links Ingabire to alleged subversion after her name was mentioned in an ongoing criminal case against nine people accused of plotting to overthrow the government of President Paul Kagame.",
      "The Rwanda Investigations Bureau said it was probing her alleged role in creating a criminal gang.",
      "Ingabire appeared in court Thursday to be questioned by prosecutors who charged that she had been communicating with the nine suspects. Among the suspects is a journalist named Theoneste Nsengimana. The rest are members of the DALFA-Umurinzi group, a party led by Ingabire that is not recognized by authorities.",
      "Ingabire previously led the FDU-Inkingi group, a coalition of opposition parties that also was never permitted to register with the government.",
      "Ingabire spent 16 years in exile in the Netherlands and returned to Rwanda to launch an opposition political movement in 2010 but was imprisoned before she could contest the presidential election.",
      "She was later found guilty of conspiracy to undermine the government and denying Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide, charges she denied.",
      "Sentenced to 15 years, she was freed in 2018 after obtaining presidential pardon.",
      "But Kagame has since threatened Ingabire with a possible return to jail. In 2020 the president said that Ingabire should not be shocked if she is locked up again.",
      "Her lawyers say she has committed no crimes.",
      "\u201cThis re-arrest is simply the latest step in an ongoing campaign of harassment and intimidation which the Rwandan government has been carrying out\u201d against Ingabire, the statement from her lawyers said.",
      "Three decades after a genocide that killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus, Rwanda\u2019s president has won international praise for presiding over a peaceful and rapid economic recovery.",
      "But Kagame has faced criticism for what human rights groups say are widespread abuses, a muzzling of independent media and suppression of political opposition. He denies the accusations. ____",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- President Vladimir Putin on Friday hailed Russia's economic outlook, saying it has managed to curb inflation and ease its reliance on energy exports.",
      "His optimistic account in a speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum contrasted with somber statements by some members of his government who warned at the same conference that Russia could face a recession. Economic Minister Maxim Reshetnikov had said Thursday that the country is \u201con the brink of going into a recession.\u201d",
      "Putin mentioned the recession warnings, but emphasized that \u201cit mustn't be allowed.\u201d He pointed out that manufacturing industries have posted steady growth, allowing the country to reduce its reliance on oil and gas exports.",
      "\u201cThe perception of Russian economy as based on raw materials and dependent on hydrocarbons exports have clearly become outdated,\u201d Putin said, adding that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first four months of 2025 and inflation has dropped from double digits to 9.6%.",
      "Putin has used the annual forum to highlight Russia\u2019s economic prowess and encourage foreign investment, but Western executives have shunned it after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, leaving it to business leaders from Asia, Africa and Latin America.",
      "The economy, hit with a slew of Western sanctions, has so far outperformed predictions. High defense spending has propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation.",
      "Large recruiting bonuses for military enlistees and death benefits for those killed in Ukraine also have put more income into the country\u2019s poorer regions. But over the long term, inflation and a lack of foreign investments pose threats to the economy.",
      "Economists have warned of mounting pressure on the economy and the likelihood it would stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military.",
      "Putin said the growth of military industries helped develop new technologies that have become available to the civilian sector.",
      "He vowed to continue military modernization, relying on lessons learned during the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe will raise the capability of the Russian armed forces, modernize military infrastructure and equip the troops with cutting-edge equipment,\u201d Putin said.",

      "The white top and blue hull of the 56-meter (184-foot) Bayesian emerged from the depths of the sea in a holding area of a yellow floating crane barge. The coast guard said the actual recovery was scheduled to begin Saturday morning.",
      "A spokesman for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation, said the vessel has been slowly raised from the seabed, 50 meters (165-feet) down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel.",
      "What became visible for the first time Friday on the surface of the water was the top of the passenger area of the Bayesian where passengers would sit, known as the accommodation area, said a spokesman for TMC Maritime, David Wilson.",
      "The British-flagged luxury superyacht sank Aug. 19 off Porticello near Palermo during a violent storm, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others. Fifteen people survived, including the captain and all crew members except the chef.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "When it resurfaced, the Bayesian was missing its 72-meter (236-foot) mast, which was cut down and left on the seabed for future removal. The mast had to be detached to allow the hull to be brought to a nearly upright position that would allow the craft to be surfaced, TMC Maritime said earlier this week.",

The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph) at the time of the sinking and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",

      "LONDON -- British health officials are warning people across the country to take precautions when out in the sun as the U.K. bakes under its first heat wave of the year.",
      "Temperatures are expected to peak at 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of eastern England on Saturday following a week of unusually warm weather, according to the national weather agency the Met Office. That\u2019s about 12 C (22 F) higher than normal for this time of year.",
      "The U.K. Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat health alert covering all of England because of increased health risks for people over 65 and those with heart and lung problems.",
      "\u201cHeat can result in serious health outcomes across the population, especially for older adults or those with pre-existing health conditions,\u201d Dr. Agostinho Sousa, head of the UKHSA, said in a statement. \u201cIt is therefore important to check on friends, family and neighbors who are more vulnerable and to take sensible precautions while enjoying the sun.\u201d",
      "Saturday is expected to be the hottest day of the heat wave, with temperatures falling slightly on Sunday and dropping back into the more normal temperatures next week, the Met Office said. The heat alert is currently scheduled to remain in effect until Monday morning.",
      "Unusually, temperatures in London this week have been higher than in many parts of Western Europe. That\u2019s because the high temperatures are not the result of hot air moving north from the Iberian Peninsula or North Africa as is often the case, the Met Office said. Instead, this weather system originated in air high over the Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland. As it approaches the U.K., it descends toward ground level, causing it to warm rapidly, Chief Meteorologist Matthew Lenhert said.",

      "The success of a key NATO summit next week is hanging in the balance",
      "BRUSSELS -- The success of a key NATO summit hung in the balance on Friday, after Spain announced that it cannot raise the billions of dollars needed to meet a new defense investment pledge demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts are meeting for two days in the Netherlands from next Tuesday. He insists that U.S. allies should commit to spending at least 5% of gross domestic product, but that requires investment at an unprecedented scale.",
      "Trump has cast doubt over whether the U.S. would defend allies that spend too little.",
      "Setting the spending goal would be a historic decision. It would see all 32 countries invest the same amount in defense for the first time. Only last week, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed confidence that they would endorse it.",
      "But in a letter to Rutte on Thursday, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez wrote that \u201ccommitting to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the (European Union\u2019s) ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter, seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Belgium, Canada, France and Italy would also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars, but Spain is the only country to officially announce its intentions, making it hard to row back from such a public decision.",
      "Beyond his economic challenges, S\u00e1nchez has other problems. He relies on small parties to govern, and corruption scandals have ensnared his inner circle and family members. He\u2019s under growing pressure to call an early election.",
      "In response to the letter, Rutte\u2019s office said only that \u201cdiscussions among allies on a new defense investment plan are ongoing.\u201d NATO\u2019s top civilian official had been due to table a new proposal on Friday to try to break the deadlock.",
      "The U.S. and French envoys had also been due to update reporters about the latest developments ahead of the summit but postponed their briefings.",
      "Rutte and many European allies are desperate to resolve the problem by Tuesday so that Trump does not derail the summit, as he did during his first term at NATO headquarters in 2018.",
      "After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NATO allies agreed that 2% of GDP should be the minimum they spend on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending its own territory against outside attack require investment of at least 3%. Spain agreed to those plans in 2023.",
      "The 5% goal is made up of two parts. The allies would agree to hike pure defense spending to 3.5% of GDP. A further 1.5% would go to upgrade roads, bridges, ports and airfields so that armies can better deploy, and to prepare societies for future attacks.",
      "Mathematically, 3.5 plus 1.5 equals Trump\u2019s 5%. But a lot is hiding behind the figures and details of what kinds of things can be included remain cloudy.",
      "Countries closest to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have all agreed to the target, as well as nearby Germany, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, which is hosting the June 24-25 summit.",
      "The Netherlands estimates that NATO\u2019s defense plans would force it to dedicate at least 3.5% to core defense spending. That means finding an additional 16 billion to 19 billion euros ($18 billion to $22 billion).",
      "Supplying arms and ammunition to Ukraine, which Spain does, will also be included as core defense spending.",
      "NATO estimates that the U.S. spent around 3.2% of GDP on defense last year.",
      "The additional 1.5% spending basket is murkier. Rutte and many members argue that infrastructure used to deploy armies to the front must be included, as well as building up defense industries and preparing citizens for possible attacks.",
      "\u201cIf a tank is not able to cross a bridge. If our societies are not prepared in case war breaks out for a whole of society approach. If we are not able to really develop the defense industrial base, then the 3.5% is great but you cannot really defend yourselves,\u201d Rutte said this month.",
      "Spain wanted climate change spending included, but that proposal was rejected. Cyber-security and counter-hybrid warfare investment should also make the cut. Yet with all the conjecture about what might be included, it\u2019s difficult to see how Rutte arrived at this 1.5% figure.",
      "It\u2019s not enough to agree to spend more money. Many allies haven't yet hit the 2% target, although most will this year, and they had a decade to get there. So an incentive is required.",
      "The date of 2032 has been floated as a deadline. That\u2019s far shorter than previous NATO targets, but military planners estimate that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on an ally within 5-10 years.",
      "The U.S. insists that it cannot be an open-ended pledge, and that a decade is too long. Still, Italy says it wants 10 years to hit the 5% target.",
      "Another issue is how fast spending should be ramped up. \u201cI have a cunning plan for that,\u201d Rutte said. He wants the allies to submit annual plans that lay out how much they intend to increase spending by.",
      "For Europe, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat. A major rise in sabotage, cyberattacks and GPS jamming incidents is blamed on Moscow. European leaders are girding their citizens for the possibility of more.",
      "The United States also insists that China poses a threat. But for European people to back a hike in national defense spending, their governments require acknowledgement that the Kremlin remains NATO\u2019s biggest security challenge.",
      "The billions required for security will be raised by taxes, going into debt, or shuffling money from other budgets. But it won\u2019t be easy for many, as Spain has shown.",
      "On top of that, Trump has made things economically tougher by launching a global tariff war \u2014 ostensibly for U.S. national security reasons \u2014 something America's allies find hard to fathom.",

      "Greece\u2019s coast guard says more than 600 migrants have been rescued after two wooden fishing boats were found sailing miles from the southernmost part of Greece",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- More than 600 migrants were rescued overnight and early Friday from two wooden fishing boats found sailing miles (kilometers) from the southernmost part of Greece, the country's coast guard said.",
      "The first fishing boat, carrying 352 people, was spotted overnight about 30 nautical miles (35 miles, 55 kilometers) south of the tiny island of Gavdos, the coast guard said. Passengers were rescued by a ship from the European border patrol agency FRONTEX, aided by a coast guard patrol boat and four other vessels.",
      "The second was found 50 nautical miles (about 60 miles, 90 kilometers) south of the island of Crete with 278 people on board. The passengers were picked up by a passing Portuguese-flagged cargo ship. In both cases, the migrants were transported to Crete.",
      "There was no immediate information on the nationalities of those on board the two fishing boats.",
      "Another two boats carrying migrants were located in the same area on Thursday, the coast guard said. One, carrying 73 men, was found south of Gavdos and another with 26 people, including one woman and three minors, was found near the coast of southern Crete.",
      "The coast guard said those on the smaller boat told authorities they had set sail the previous evening from Tobruk in Libya, and had each paid smugglers either 4,000 euros ($5,500) for their passage to Greece. Two Sudanese teenagers, one aged 16 and the other 19, were arrested on suspicion of migrant smuggling after other passengers identified them as having been operating the boat.",
      "Greece has been on one of the preferred routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for decades. Arrivals from neighboring Turkey to the east and the Libyan coast to the south spiked last year, with Greece recording more than 60,000 people arriving \u2014 the vast majority by sea \u2014 in 2024, compared to just over 48,000 the previous year, according to figures from the U.N. refugee agency. As of June 15 this year, a total of 16,290 arrivals were recorded, with more than 14,600 of those by sea.",
      "With authorities closely patrolling the eastern sea border with Turkey to prevent migrant boats reaching nearby Greek islands, smugglers appear to be increasingly opting for the much longer and riskier Mediterranean Sea crossing from the north African coast to the southern tip of Greece, using larger boats into which they can cram more people.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian drones slammed into two Ukrainian cities, killing at least one person in nighttime attacks, authorities said Friday, as a Kremlin official said he expected an announcement next week on dates for a fresh round of direct peace talks.",
      "Russia\u2019s overnight drone assault targeted the southern Ukraine port city of Odesa and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, hitting apartment blocks, officials said.",

      "\u201cRussia continues its tactics of targeted terror against our people,\u201d Zelenskyy said on messaging app Telegram, urging the United States and the European Union to crank up economic pressure on Russia.",
      "Russia has shown no signs of relenting in its attacks, more than three years after it invaded its neighbor. It is pressing a summer offensive on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and has kept up long-range strikes that have hit civilian areas.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the date for the next round peace talks is expected to be agreed upon next week.",
      "Kyiv officials have not recently spoken about resuming talks with Russia, last held when delegations met in Istanbul on June 2, though Ukraine continues to offer a ceasefire and support U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting.",
      "The two rounds of brief talks yielded only agreements on the exchange of prisoners and wounded soldiers.",
      "A fire caused by Russia\u2019s nighttime strike on Odesa engulfed a four-story residential building, which partly collapsed and injured three emergency workers. A separate fire spread across the upper floors of a 23-story high-rise, leading to the evacuation of around 600 residents.",
      "In Kharkiv, at least eight drones hit civilian infrastructure, injuring four people, including two children, according to Ukraine\u2019s Emergency Service.",

      "A Malaysian court has dropped three money laundering charges against jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak in a case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of a state fund",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- A Malaysian court dropped three money laundering charges against jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Friday, in a case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of a state fund.",
      "Najib was previously convicted in a graft case tied to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad state fund, or 1MBD, and began serving time in 2022, after losing his final appeal. He also faces other graft trials.",
      "The High Court's decision to drop the charges alleging Najib received 27 million ringgit ($6.3 million) in illegal proceeds to his bank accounts came after procedural delays by the prosecution, which saw the case dragging on for six years, Najib's lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said. Prosecutors could not give the court a timeline for when they will be ready for the trial, he added.",
      "Prosecutors reserve the right to revive charges against Najib and a discharge does not mean an acquittal, Shafee said. But, Najib was happy and can now focus on the main 1MDB trial, he added.",
      "Najib set up 1MDB shortly after taking power in 2009. Investigators allege that more than $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by his associates to finance Hollywood films and extravagant purchases. The scandal upended Najib\u2019s government and he was defeated in the 2018 election.",
      "Last November, the High Court also discharged Najib and the former treasury chief in another 1MDB-linked corruption case after repeated delays by the prosecution. The pair can still be charged for the same offence in the future. In 2023, Najib was acquitted on separate charges of tampering with a government audit into 1MDB.",
      "Najib was sentenced to 12 years in jail in his first graft trial but the sentence was halved by the Pardon Boards in 2024. Najib alleged the board had issued a home arrest order for him to complete his sentence at home, but the case is still being heard in court.",
      "Najib awaits his verdict in another key case that ties him directly to the 1MDB scandal, which has prompted investigations in the U.S. and several other countries.",
      "The defense in May closed their case on four charges of abuse of power to obtain over $700 million from 1MDB that went into Najib\u2019s bank accounts, and 21 counts of money laundering involving the same amount. Closing arguments are scheduled in October, after which the court will set a date for verdict.",

He said Wednesday that he\u2019ll decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in the war given the \u201csubstantial chance\u201d for renewed negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "China considers Taiwan its own territory and uses such deployments to advertise its threat to encircle and possibly invade the self-governing island. China also hopes to intimidate Taiwan\u2019s population of 23 million and wear down its equipment and the morale of its armed forces.",

    "story": [
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has launched a sweeping anti-Ukraine campaign he hopes will sway voters ahead of elections next year, and discredit his chief political rival",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- As Hungary heads toward national elections next spring and the populist government's popularity slumps, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has zeroed in on a central theme he hopes will sway voters: an alleged threat posed by neighboring Ukraine.",
      "While most European Union countries have offered political, financial, and military support to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Hungary under Orb\u00e1n has charted a starkly different course \u2014 refusing to supply Ukraine with weapons or allow their transit through Hungarian territory, demanding sanctions relief and rapprochement with Russia, and adopting a combative stance toward both Kyiv and its EU backers.",
      "With his ruling Fidesz party slipping in the polls and a new opposition force gaining momentum, Orb\u00e1n has escalated a sweeping anti-Ukraine campaign \u2014 presenting the upcoming election as a referendum on peace or war. Going further, he has accused his leading political opponent of entering into a treasonous pact with Kyiv to overthrow his government and install a pro-Western, pro-Ukraine administration.",
      "Some of his ideas mirror the growing anti-Ukraine messaging coming from right-wing populists in the West, including from President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be under no illusions: Brussels and Ukraine are jointly building up a puppet government (in Hungary),\u201d Orb\u00e1n said on June 6 in comments to state radio. \u201cThey want to change Hungary\u2019s policy toward Ukraine after the next elections, or even sooner.\u201d",
      "At the heart of Orb\u00e1n's claims is Ukraine's ambition to join the EU, something Kyiv believes would place it firmly within the embrace of the West and provide a measure of security against potential Russian attacks in the future.",
      "While Orb\u00e1n was a firm supporter of Ukraine's eventual EU accession shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, he now argues that its membership \u2014 which will likely take many years \u2014 would flood Hungary with crime, cheap labor, and low-quality agricultural products, threatening national sovereignty and economic stability.",
      "He has also spuriously claimed that Brussels and Kyiv intend to force Hungarians to fight Russia on the front lines. On Monday, Orb\u00e1n posted a video to his social media page depicting animated, artificial intelligence-generated scenes of bloodied, machine-gun wielding Hungarian soldiers engaged in armed conflict, and rows of caskets lined beneath Hungarian flags.",
      "\u201cWe don't want our children, in the form of the Hungarian army, to be deployed to the Ukrainian front lines or to Ukrainian territory and to come back in coffins,\u201d he said in the video.",
      "Central to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s life-or-death narrative of the Hungarian election is his growing campaign against his main political rival, P\u00e9ter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider whose new Tisza party has surged in popularity.",
      "Once married to Hungary\u2019s former justice minister, Magyar has become the most formidable challenger to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rule since the EU's longest-serving leader took office in 2010. With Tisza leading Fidesz in most independent polls, some analysts and domestic critics believe Orb\u00e1n may be laying the groundwork to discredit or even disqualify Magyar ahead of the 2026 election.",
      "P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, director of the Budapest-based Political Capital think tank, said Orb\u00e1n's attempt to link Magyar and Tisza to the image of a dangerous Ukraine is aimed at neutralizing his domestic opposition as popular sentiment appears to be turning against him.",
      "\u201cThere is an ongoing campaign against any critical voices in Hungary saying that they are agents of Ukraine, and this can be used also against the Tisza party,\" he told The Associated Press. \"If you can\u2019t win back public opinion anymore, then you can try to use a more authoritarian toolkit.\u201d",
      "Beyond political rhetoric, such accusations have reached the highest levels of diplomacy. In May, Ukraine's main security agency said that it had arrested two people on suspicion of spying for Hungary by gathering intelligence on Ukraine\u2019s military defenses in the west of the country. That set off a tit-for-tat series of diplomatic expulsions, and accusations from Hungary's government that the affair was part of a concerted Ukrainian campaign involving Magyar and his party to undermine Orb\u00e1n.",
      "The prime minister accused Magyar and Tisza of being \u201cpro-Ukrainian\u201d and supporting Ukraine\u2019s EU bid, and alleging that a prominent Tisza member, the former chief of staff of the Hungarian military, has \u201cdeep ties with Ukrainian intelligence.\u201d No evidence has been provided to support the claims, which Magyar has dismissed outright.",
      "\u201cIt is outrageous and blood-boiling when a patriot who trained and prepared to be a soldier since the age of 14 and who took a military oath ... is accused of treason by people who would sell their country out,\u201d Magyar told a news conference on June 5.",
      "To reinforce its message, the Hungarian government launched a state-funded communication blitz in March, accompanied by a non-binding \u201cnational consultation\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s EU membership. Billboards, television ads, and social media posts have flooded the country, portraying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as the architects of a plot to undermine, or even destroy Hungary.",

    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, crushed internal threats during more than three decades in power",
      "CAIRO -- Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who crushed internal threats repeatedly during more than three decades in power, now faces his greatest challenge yet.",
      "His archenemy, Israel, has secured free rein over Iran\u2019s skies and is decimating the country\u2019s military leadership and nuclear program with its punishing air campaign. It is also threatening his life: Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Khamenei \u201ccannot continue to exist.\u201d",
      "The 86-year-old leader faces a choice. He could escalate Iran's retaliation against Israel and risk even heavier damage from Israeli bombardment. Or he could seek a diplomatic solution that keeps the U.S. out of the conflict, and risk having to give up the nuclear program he has put at the center of Iranian policy for years.",
      "In a video address Wednesday he sounded defiant, vowing \u201cthe Iranian nation is not one to surrender\u201d and warning that if the U.S. steps in, it will bring \u201cirreparable damage to them.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Khamenei:",
      "When he rose to power in 1989, Khamenei had to overcome deep doubts about his authority as he succeeded the leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A low-level cleric at the time, Khamenei didn't have his predecessor's religious credentials. With his thick glasses and plodding style, he didn't have his fiery charisma either.",
      "But Khamenei has ruled three times longer than the late Khomeini and has shaped Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic perhaps even more dramatically.",
      "He entrenched the system of rule by the \u201cmullahs,\" or Shiite Muslim clerics. That secured his place in the eyes of hardliners as the unquestionable authority \u2014 below only that of God. At the same time, Khamenei built the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard into the dominant force in Iran\u2019s military and internal politics.",
      "The Guard boasts Iran\u2019s most elite military and oversees its ballistic missile program. Its international arm, the Quds Force, pieced together the \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d the collection of pro-Iranian proxies stretching from Yemen to Lebanon that for years gave Iran considerable power across the region. Khamenei also gave the Guard a free hand to build a network of businesses allowing it to dominate Iran\u2019s economy.",
      "In return, the Guard became his loyal shock force.",
      "The first major threat to Khamenei\u2019s grip was the reform movement that swept into a parliament majority and the presidency soon after he became supreme leader. The movement advocated for giving greater power to elected officials \u2013 something Khamenei\u2019s hardline supporters feared would lead to dismantling the Islamic Republic system.",
      "Khamenei stymied the reformists by rallying the clerical establishment. Unelected bodies run by the mullahs succeeded in shutting down major reforms and barring reform candidates from running in elections.",
      "The Revolutionary Guard and Iran\u2019s other security agencies crushed waves of protests that followed the failure of the reform movement. Huge nationwide protests erupted in 2009 over allegations of vote-rigging. Under the weight of sanctions, economic protests broke out in 2017 and 2019. More nationwide protests broke out in 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini after police detained her for not wearing her mandatory headscarf properly.",
      "Hundreds were killed in crackdowns on the protests, and hundreds more arrested amid reports of detainees tortured to death or raped in prison.",
      "Still, the successive protests showed the strains in Iran\u2019s theocratic system and lay bare widespread resentment of clerical rule, corruption and economic troubles. Trying to defuse anger, authorities often eased enforcement of some of the Islamic Republic\u2019s social restrictions.",
      "When Khamenei took power, Iran was just emerging from its long war with Iraq that left the country battered and isolated.",
      "Over the next three decades, Khamenei turned Iran around into as assertive power wielding influence across the Middle East. One major boost was the U.S.\u2019s 2003 ouster of Saddam Hussein, which eventually brought Iranian-allied Shiite politicians and militias to power in Iraq.",
      "Iraq provided a linchpin in Iran\u2019s Axis of Resistance, grouping Bashar Assad\u2019s Syria, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. By 2015, the alliance was at its height, putting Iran on Israel\u2019s doorstep.",
      "Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel brought a massive Israeli retaliation on the Gaza Strip. It also brought a turnaround in Israeli policy. After years of trying to fend off and tamp down Iran's allies, Israel made crushing them it's goal. Hamas has been crippled, though not eliminated, even at the cost of the decimation of Gaza.",
      "Israel has similarly sidelined Hezbollah \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 with weeks of bombardment in Lebanon last year, along with a dramatic attack with booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies that stunned the group. An even heavier blow to Hezbollah was the fall in December of Syria's Bashar Assad when Sunni rebels marched on the capital and removed him from power. Now, a government hostile to Iran and Hezbollah rules from Damascus.",
      "Iran's Axis of Resistance is at its lowest ebb ever.",

      "A judge could decide Friday whether to advance OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids will go before a judge Friday, potentially setting up votes on whether to accept it for local governments, people who became addicted to the drug and other groups.",
      "This month, 49 states announced they have signed on to the the proposal. Only Oklahoma, which has a separate settlement with the company, is not involved.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane could decide as soon as Friday whether to advance the nationwide settlement, which was hammered out in negotiations between the company, groups that have sued and representatives of members of the Sackler family who own the company.",
      "If Lane moves the plan forward as it's been presented, government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal.",
      "The settlement is a way to avoid trials with claims from states alone that total more than $2 trillion in damages.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper to protect members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "In the new version, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payments would not begin until after a hearing, likely in November, during which Judge Lane would be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters",
      "LONDON -- Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters.",
      "Deezer, based in Paris, is grappling with a surge in music on its platform created using artificial intelligence tools it says are being wielded to earn royalties fraudulently.",
      "The app will display an on-screen label warning about \u201cAI-generated content\" and notify listeners that some tracks on an album were created with song generators.",
      "Deezer is a small player in music streaming, which is dominated by Spotify, Amazon and Apple, but the company said AI-generated music is an \u201cindustry-wide issue.\u201d It's committed to \u201csafeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favor of training AI models,\" CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a press release.",
      "Deezer's move underscores the disruption caused by generative AI systems, which are trained on the contents of the internet including text, images and audio available online. AI companies are facing a slew of lawsuits challenging their practice of scraping the web for such training data without paying for it.",
      "According to an AI song detection tool that Deezer rolled out this year, 18% of songs uploaded to its platform each day, or about 20,000 tracks, are now completely AI generated. Just three months earlier, that number was 10%, Lanternier said in a recent interview.",
      "AI has many benefits but it also \"creates a lot of questions\" for the music industry, Lanternier told The Associated Press. Using AI to make music is fine as long as there's an artist behind it but the problem arises when anyone, or even a bot, can use it to make music, he said.",
      "Music fraudsters \u201ccreate tons of songs. They upload, they try to get on playlists or recommendations, and as a result they gather royalties,\u201d he said.",
      "Musicians can't upload music directly to Deezer or rival platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. Music labels or digital distribution platforms can do it for artists they have contracts with, while anyone else can use a \u201cself service\u201d distribution company.",
      "Fully AI-generated music still accounts for only about 0.5% of total streams on Deezer. But the company said it's \u201cevident\" that fraud is \u201cthe primary purpose\" for these songs because it suspects that as many as seven in 10 listens of an AI song are done by streaming \"farms\" or bots, instead of humans.",
      "Any AI songs used for \u201cstream manipulation\u201d will be cut off from royalty payments, Deezer said.",
      "AI has been a hot topic in the music industry, with debates swirling around its creative possibilities as well as concerns about its legality.",
      "Two of the most popular AI song generators, Suno and Udio, are being sued by record companies for copyright infringement, and face allegations they exploited recorded works of artists from Chuck Berry to Mariah Carey.",
      "Gema, a German royalty-collection group, is suing Suno in a similar case filed in Munich, accusing the service of generating songs that are \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to original versions by artists it represents, including \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville, \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d by Boney M and Lou Bega's \u201cMambo No. 5.\u201d",
      "Major record labels are reportedly negotiating with Suno and Udio for compensation, according to news reports earlier this month.",
      "To detect songs for tagging, Lanternier says Deezer uses the same generators used to create songs to analyze their output.",
      "\u201cWe identify patterns because the song creates such a complex signal. There is lots of information in the song,\u201d Lanternier said.",
      "The AI music generators seem to be unable to produce songs without subtle but recognizable patterns, which change constantly.",
      "\u201cSo you have to update your tool every day,\" Lanternier said. \"So we keep generating songs to learn, to teach our algorithm. So we\u2019re fighting AI with AI.\u201d",
      "Fraudsters can earn big money through streaming. Lanternier pointed to a criminal case last year in the U.S., which authorities said was the first ever involving artificially inflated music streaming. Prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud conspiracy, accusing him of generating hundreds of thousands of AI songs and using bots to automatically stream them billions of times, earning at least $10 million.",

      "\u201cThe world is in the middle of a trade war and several wars, actual wars, including wars that can have quite significant implications for commodity prices and global growth,\u201d said Carney, who led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "The legislation came about as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.",
      "Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.",
      "\u201cOur residents shouldn\u2019t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,\u201d Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.",
      "Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.",
      "Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.",
      "Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.",
      "\u201cThis bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they\u2019re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.",
      "Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,\u201d the company said this week.",

      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don\u2019t support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips",
      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid.",
      "The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a huge hole in this concept of \u2018no tax on tips\u2019 because a lot of restaurant workers aren\u2019t receiving tips in the first place,\u201d said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.\u201d",
      "For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.",
      "The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that \u201ccash tips\u201d qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement.",
      "Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn\u2019t respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s.",
      "The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.",
      "But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal leaves out too many of those workers.",
      "The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers\u2019 bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.",
      "Skandalos tried pooling servers\u2019 tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn\u2019t understand and kept tipping.",
      "Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.",
      "Skandalos said \u201cno tax on tips\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people\u2019s pocketbooks, but now let\u2019s finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.",
      "\u201c\u2019No tax on tips\u2019 is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,\u201d he said.",
      "Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour.",
      "Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford\u2019s bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they\u2019re inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it.",
      "For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay.",
      "\u201cI think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,\u201d she said.",

      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in a letter sent on Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.",
      "Most U.S. allies in NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "A NATO official on Thursday said that discussions between allies were ongoing about a new defense spending plan.",
      "\u201cFor Spain, committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive, as it would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the EU\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said in April that the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "On Thursday, S\u00e1nchez called for \u201ca more flexible formula\u201d in relation to a new spending target \u2014 one that either made it optional or left Spain out of its application.",
      "S\u00e1nchez wrote that the country is \u201cfully committed to NATO,\" but that meeting a 5% target \u201cwould be incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.\" He said that doing so would require cutting public services and scaling back other spending, including toward the green transition.",
      "Instead, Spain will need to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet the Spanish military\u2019s estimated defense needs, S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "At home, corruption scandals that have ensnared S\u00e1nchez's inner circle and family members have put the Spanish leader under increasing pressure to call an early election, even from some allies. In April, when S\u00e1nchez announced that Spain would reach NATO's previous 2% spending target, the move angered some coalition members further to the left of his Socialist Party.",
      "NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on military expenditure after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. But the alliance's plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investments of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "But Spain isn't alone among NATO's low spenders. Belgium, Canada and Italy will also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will be given to reach an agreed-upon new spending goal.",
      "A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are \u201dslowing down but not collapsing,\u201d according to a Bain & Co. consultancy study released Thursday.",
      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",
      "\u201cStill, to be positive in a difficult moment \u2014 with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever \u2014 it\u2019s not a market in collapse,\u2019\u2019 said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D\u2019Arpizio. \u201cIt is slowing down but not collapsing.\u201d",
      "Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags.",
      "Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence.",
      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",

      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",
      "With aesthetic changes afoot \u201cstuffing the channels doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said.",

      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",
      "President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, \u201cplacing us well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Buss family's decision to sell a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at an eye-popping franchise valuation of $10 billion marks the end of nearly a half-century when one of the most valuable properties in the sports world was run by an eccentric father and his sometimes squabbling children.",
      "With high-living playboy Jerry Buss and current team governor Jeanie Buss in charge, the glamorous Lakers essentially have been the professional sports equivalent of a quirky family business for two generations.",
      "Sports became increasingly corporate and monolithic in the 21st century while franchise values skyrocketed and ever-more-wealthy titans seized control of this perpetual growth industry.",
      "Just not around Hollywood's favorite basketball team, with its gold uniforms and 17 golden trophies.",
      "\u201cThe majority of businesses in this country are family-owned businesses,\u201d Jeanie Buss told NPR earlier this year in a rare interview to promote a Netflix comedy series based on her career. \u201cAnd everybody has a family. If you\u2019re in business with them, (disagreements) happen. But at the end of the day, what brings you together is the team or the business, and you want to build something successful.\u201d",
      "The Lakers and the Buss clan have been inextricable since 1979 \u2014 the longest active ownership tenure in the NBA \u2014 but Mark Walter's stunning sports coup Wednesday effectively ends this improbable era. A person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed it to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced the deal.",
      "The sale should make an extraordinarily wealthy woman of Jeanie Buss, one of Jerry\u2019s seven acknowledged children and a longtime employee of his various sporting concerns.",
      "And that's the biggest reason many Lakers fans are rejoicing: This lavish sale comes with the knowledge that the buyers have exponentially more resources than the Buss family \u2014 and Walter has showed he knows how to spend it intelligently.",
      "Walter, who heads a group that already bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021, has a sterling reputation in Southern California for his group's stewardship of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The iconic baseball team has become a perpetual World Series contender with bold, aggressive financial moves grounded in smart organizational planning ever since Walter's firm, Guggenheim Partners, paid $2 billion to wrest the Dodgers from the reviled Frank McCourt in 2012.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really committed to the city of Los Angeles in various ways, and sports is something that he\u2019s very passionate about, and certainly Los Angeles sports,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Speaking (as) a Dodger employee, he\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family.\u201d",
      "In the Buss era, the Lakers could sell prospective players on their trophies, sunny Los Angeles and that family-business intimacy. While that was enough to win big in most decades, Walter\u2019s group epitomizes the modern, deep-pocketed approach to building a consistent championship contender. Guggenheim Partners reportedly has $325 billion under management, with Walter particularly leveraging insurance investments to pursue gains across the breadth of the sports world.",
      "\u201cHe does everything he can to provide resources, support,\" Roberts said. \u201cHe wants to win. He feels that the fans, the city, deserve that. I think that that\u2019s never lost, and it\u2019s more of challenging us always. How do we become better and not complacent or stagnant, to continue to stay current with the market, the competition to win?\u201d",
      "Before this sale, the Buss siblings were not thought to be particularly wealthy, at least not by team owner standards. Jeanie Buss occasionally appeared to balk at writing certain checks \u2014 ask any Lakers fan about Alex Caruso's departure \u2014 and the team's front office and infrastructure are thought to be on the NBA's smaller side.",
      "The new ownership group's wealth could knock down some financial barriers in the restrictive, apron era of salary cap management. It definitely will provide the Lakers with every resource in scouting, player development and any other competitive avenue to assemble a team commensurate with the Lakers' brand.",
      "\u201cI know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss,\u201d Magic Johnson wrote on social media. \u201cNow she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She\u2019s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans!\u201d",
      "There is a familial symmetry to these two transactions 46 years apart: Jerry Buss got a steal when he bought the Lakers, and his kids might end up with the wealthiest deal in sports history when they sell.",
      "Jerry Buss was a chemist and USC instructor who heavily leveraged his real estate investments to buy the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum arena and a large ranch from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million. Buss loved a good time almost as much as he loved basketball, and he built the Showtime era of Lakers basketball on Magic and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but also on his own undeniable charisma and hunger for titles.",
      "Buss and his front offices then landed Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the 1990s, ushering in a second championship era. All told, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals in 16 of Jerry Buss' 34 seasons as their primary owner, winning a whopping 10 championships.",
      "Jeanie Buss succeeded her father as the Lakers\u2019 governor upon his death in 2013. Her brother, Jim, was the Lakers' head of basketball operations until Jeanie fired him in February 2017 and installed Johnson and Rob Pelinka, Bryant's former agent. Pelinka gradually took over basketball operations and presided over a string of Lakers-worthy player additions, including LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic.",
      "The Lakers won the 2020 championship in the Florida bubble, and they reached the 2024 Western Conference finals. Their seismic trade to acquire Doncic last winter rejuvenated the franchise, positioning the Slovenian superstar as the Lakers' centerpiece for years after the matchless career of James, who has essentially confirmed he will return in the fall for his record 23rd NBA season.",
      "Jeanie Buss hasn't yet announced her reasons for agreeing to sell her inheritance, and she will remain the Lakers' governor \u2014 at least for now, because a governor must own at least 15% of the team. But she is following a recent trend of high-profile NBA owners ceding their teams to ownership groups with even more extensive resources.",
      "Buss is close friends with both Mark Cuban, who sold his majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion, and Wyc Grousbeck, who sold the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion.",

      "Now the more than century-old farm \u2014 the last duck farm remaining in a New York region once synonymous with the culinary delicacy \u2014 is cautiously rebuilding.",
      "But for Corwin, a 66-year-old fourth-generation farmer, it's not enough to bring the farm back to its 100,000-bird capacity.",
      "With ducks hatched from eggs spared from slaughter, he's working to preserve the unique lineage of fowl that's allowed his family's farm to thrive even as others on Long Island fell by the wayside \u2014 all while worrying that another flu outbreak would finally wipe him out.",
      "\u201cAll I know is I don\u2019t want to be hit again,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cIf I go through this twice, I\u2019m done as a duck farmer.\u201d",
      "For months, Corwin and his reduced staff have been thoroughly sanitizing the farm\u2019s dozens of barns, clearing out hay and debris, and replacing feeders, ventilation systems, wooden and metal structures and more.",
      "At the end of May, the first wave of roughly 900 young ducks arrived from a nearby farm where they had been carefully raised in quarantine these last few months.",
      "Another batch of 900 arrived last week and some 900 more will soon make their way to the roughly 140-acre (55-hectare) farm in Aquebogue, which is tucked among the vineyards and agricultural lands of Long Island\u2019s North Fork, about 80 miles (129 km) east of Manhattan.",
      "By the end of next summer, Corwin hopes the first ducks will be ready to be processed and brought to market.",
      "But he says he won't rush the reopening. It will be many more months \u2014 if ever \u2014 before the operation, which processed about 1 million ducks for consumption annually, returns to full capacity, he said.",
      "\u201cI keep telling people I\u2019m running a high hurdle race,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot a lot of steps to get back to where we were.\u201d",
      "Since 2022, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in all 50 states, leading to more than 1,700 recorded outbreaks affecting nearly 175 million birds, according to the most recent tally from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The outbreak at Corwin\u2019s farm shows how this strain has inflicted more damage on a wider range of species than past variants, said Dr. Gavin Hitchener, director of Cornell University\u2019s Duck Research Laboratory, located a short drive away in Eastport.",
      "Ducks have generally been less prone to serious illness and death than chickens and turkeys, he said. H5N1 is also vexing American cattle farmers after the virus jumped from fowl to cattle last year.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed in the virus\u2019 makeup that has made it more virulent,\u201d Hitchener said.",
      "With no end to the bird flu pandemic in sight, Corwin worries he won't be able to weather another outbreak.",
      "The farm received federal compensation for its euthanized ducks, but it wasn\u2019t nearly close to the market value of the birds \u2014 never mind the expense of rebuilding in a high cost region that also includes the Hamptons, he said.",
      "Corwin hopes the federal government will, at long last, require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu. It\u2019s an uphill climb, given the Trump administration\u2019s deep skepticism of vaccines and the long-standing opposition of far larger, industrial poultry operations, he acknowledged.",
      "\u201cI would sleep an awful lot better at night. But right now I\u2019m very nervous,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just playing with deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d",
      "The ducks newly arrived to the farm are crucial to its revival.",
      "Fully grown and approaching breeding age, the cohort of white Pekin ducks were all that survived from the more than 15,000 eggs state officials allowed the farm to spare from the winter culling after they tested negative for bird flu.",
      "That means they and their progeny carry on the unique genetic makeup the farm has honed over generations of selective breeding to build its reputation.",
      "Established in 1908 by Corwin\u2019s great-grandfather, Crescent Duck Farms has been the island\u2019s lone commercial duck operation for the better part of a decade. But in the early 1960s, Long Island boasted more than 100 farms producing about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s duck output.",
      "\u201cI feel I owe it to the ancestors of farmers who\u2019ve been here all these years and have come this far to just make a go of it,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI want to make Long Island proud.\u201d",

      "Redemption Holding Co. has completed its acquisition of Utah-based Holladay Bank & Trust, making it the first time a bank has been owned by a Black-led investment group in the Western U.S.",
      "The newly formed Redemption Bank will be the first Black-owned bank in U.S. history not physically located within an economically vulnerable community, the first in the Rockies, and the only one located in the Black-banking desert that stretches from Houston to Los Angeles.",
      "The bank, with roughly $65 million in assets, will focus primarily on doing commercial lending and creating a dedicated team for small business loans.",
      "Ashley Bell, CEO and chairman of Redemption Holding, told The Associated Press the company will launch a fully digital platform at the end of summer, enabling it to service small businesses across the country. The company will remain headquartered in Salt Lake City, a city with a Black population of under 3%.",
      "\"We found an exceptional business environment in Utah, specifically in Holladay, along with a bank that has a clean balance sheet and a state with the highest average return on assets for banks in the country. We are committed to competing in Utah to earn the business of customers from all backgrounds,\" Bell said.",
      "The original purchase of Holladay Bank was announced in 2023, but Bell said the transaction got delayed due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank that year.",
      "\u201cThis process has undoubtedly taken longer than any of us anticipated,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHowever, we are grateful for the diligence of the staff at the FDIC, the leadership of the (American Bankers Association), and the renewed sense of urgency from the new administration this year, all of which helped bring everything together.\u201d",
      "Bernice A. King, the youngest child of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is expected to serve as Redemption Bank\u2019s senior vice president for corporate strategy and serve on the company\u2019s advisory board.",
      "The company will be the 24th Black-owned bank in the nation, which are known as Minority Depository Institutions (MDI). The last created MDI, a federal designation for banks and unions that are owned or directed by minority groups, was Adelphi Bank in 2023.",
      "MDIs began in the 19th century when Black Americans, who could not get loans from mainstream banks, organized their banks and associations. They also provided financial services and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods.",
      "The Civil Rights Movement spurred the creation of more MDIs as Black people experienced a financial boom and began to build stronger communities. In the late 1980s, Congress officially created MDIs through the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).",
      "Redemption Holding purchased Holladay with a group of investors that included Ally Financial Inc. and Central Bancorporation.",

      "The Buss family has agreed to sell the controlling stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to TWG Global CEO Mark Walter, doing so with a franchise valuation of $10 billion \u2014 the highest ever for a professional sports franchise, a person with knowledge of the agreement said Wednesday.",
      "As part of the deal, Jeanie Buss \u2014 whose family has had control of the Lakers since her father bought the team in 1979 \u2014 intends to remain as team governor, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced details.",
      "It is not clear how much more of the Lakers that Walter is acquiring. He was part of a group that bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021. Jeanie Buss will still own at least 15% of the Lakers once this transaction is completed; by NBA rule, a governor must have at least that much of an ownership stake.",
      "Walter and TWG Global already had the controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, and \u2014 through TWG Motorsports \u2014 owns several auto racing teams including Cadillac Formula 1.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said news of the sale to Walter marks \"a very exciting day for the Lakers, for the city of Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family,\" Roberts said.",
      "ESPN first reported the agreement.",
      "\u201cMark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand,\u201d Lakers legend Magic Johnson, a business partner of Walter's and someone extremely close to Jeanie Buss, posted on social media. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding on what he\u2019s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers. Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!\u201d",
      "Johnson said he is certain Jeanie Buss made the deal only after being convinced that Walter will do right by the Lakers.",
      "\u201cLaker fans should be (ecstatic),\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA few things I can tell you about Mark \u2014 he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike \u2014 they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world.\u201d",
      "Walter is intensely private in shunning the spotlight. He is CEO of the financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, which is estimated to have more than $325 billion in assets. Johnson is among Guggenheim\u2019s investors.",
      "The agreement for the sale of the Lakers comes about three months after Bill Chisholm agreed to buy the Boston Celtics with an initial valuation of $6.1 billion \u2014 which was going to be a record, topping the previous mark of $6.05 billion sale for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The Celtics' sale is not yet finalized, pending final approval by the NBA's board of governors. That board is scheduled to meet in Las Vegas next month.",
      "And now, the Lakers are sold with a valuation of $10 billion \u2014 not just a record, but a total smashing of the previous mark.",
      "The Lakers have been in the control of the Buss family for 46 years, the longest of any current NBA franchise. Herb Simon bought the Indiana Pacers \u2014 currently in the NBA Finals \u2014 in 1983, the second-longest current ownership of an NBA club.",
      "Jerry Buss bought the Lakers for $67.5 million and made it to the NBA Finals 16 times out of his 34 seasons leading the club, winning 10 championships in that span. When he died in 2013, ownership of the Lakers went into a trust controlled by Buss\u2019 six children \u2014 who all worked for the Lakers in various capacities for several years.",
      "Eventually, the family began clashing over control. An agreement was struck in 2017 calling for Jeanie Buss to serve as controlling owner, ending a battle that included her going to court after her brothers Jim and Johnny Buss called for a board meeting that she interpreted as a challenge to her power \u2014 shortly after she removed Jim Buss as the Lakers\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations.",

      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle",
      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "The fly's appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins\u2019 plan \u201cseems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\u201cThe only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\u201d Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\u201cWe have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\u201d Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone. Or rather, wireless services that could power it.",
      "From cosmetics to snacks and signature spirits, brands launched or co-owned by high-profile figures are just about everywhere you look today. But several big names are also venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators \u2014 or MVNOs, an industry term for businesses that provide cell coverage by leasing infrastructure from bigger, more established carriers.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's family was the most recent to join the list with the launch of Trump Mobile this week. Here's what to know.",
      "On Monday, The Trump Organization (currently run by the president's sons Eric and Donald Jr.) unveiled Trump Mobile. The company says this new business will offer cell service, through an apparent licensing deal with \u201call three major cellular carriers\" in the U.S., and sell gold phones by August.",
      "Trump Mobile marks the latest in a string of new Trump-branded offerings \u2014 which already span from golden sneakers to \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d bibles \u2014 despite mounting ethical concerns that the president is profiting off his position and could distort public policy for personal gain.",
      "\"This raises a real question about a conflict of interest,\u201d said Ben Bentzin, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business. As the sitting president, Trump appoints leadership for the Federal Communications Commission \u2014 and the family's new phone venture exists under this regulatory authority.",
      "All of this sets Trump Mobile apart from other big names that have recently ventured into the wireless business. Still, its launch arrives as a growing number of celebrities tap into this space.",
      "Just last week, actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett launched SmartLess Mobile, a name that mirrors the trio's \u201cSmartLess\u201d podcast. Now live across the contiguous U.S. and Puerto Rico, SmartLess Mobile runs on T-Mobile's 5G Network.",
      "Another wireless provider with ties to fame is Mint Mobile. While not launched by celebrities, Ryan Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in Mint in 2019. Mint's parent, the Ka\u2019ena Corporation, was later acquired by T-Mobile in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion.",
      "Beyond names of famous people, well-known brands that weren't traditionally in the phone business have also got in on the action over the years \u2014 particuarly outside of the U.S., Forrester Research senior analyst Octavio Garcia Granados notes. He points to Walmart's \u201cBait\u201d mobile plan in Mexico, for example, as well as Italian soccer club AC Milan launching its own mobile SIM cards for fans.",
      "\u201cThe MVNO market is not new,\" said Garcia Granados. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the development on how it\u2019s consumed and the (ease) for brands to launch such plans.\u201d",
      "MVNOs have also emerged outside of high-profile brands or launch teams. Bentzin points to Straight Talk and Cricket \u2014 which are now owned by Verizon and AT&T, respectively. Still, traditional celebrity endorsements are common across the board. And in recent years, \u201cinfluencer marketing\" has been \u201cthe fastest growing area of advertising and promotion,\" he notes.",
      "For Trump Mobile, the pitch seems to be all about having an \u201call-American service\" while also tapping into the fan base of the president.",
      "The company noted Monday that it chose to unveil Trump Mobile on the 10th anniversary of Trump launching \"his historic presidential campaign.\u201d The name given to its flagship offer, The 47 Plan, and the $47.45 monthly fee make reference to the president's two terms. And a mock-up of the planned gold phone on the company\u2019s website shows Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great\u201d slogan on the front screen.",
      "According to the company, Trump Mobile's 47 Plan will include unlimited calls, texts and data through partner carriers, as well as free roadside assistance and telehealth services. It also says the new phone, called the \u201cT1 Phone,\u201d will be available for $499 in August \u2014 but notes that this device won\u2019t be designed or made by Trump Mobile. Still, the company emphasized that these phones will be built in the U.S.",
      "Experts have since shared skepticism about that being possible in two months. And beyond the future T1 Phone, others stress that a monthly cell service fee of just under $50 is pricey compared to other MVNO options today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not actual lower pricing. It\u2019s really trading on the fan base, if you will, of Trump,\u201d said Bentzin.",
      "SmartLess Mobile and Mint Mobile, of course, don't carry these same political ties. And the wireless plans offered by both boast less expensive offerings.",
      "T-Mobile-owned Mint advertises \u201cflexible, buy-in-bulk\u201d plans that range from $15 to $30 a month. Each option includes unlimited talk and text nationwide, but vary depending on plan length and data amount. Mint, founded in 2016, says it started \u201cbecause we\u2019d had enough of the wireless industry\u2019s games\u201d \u2014 and promises to help consumers avoid hidden fees.",
      "SmartLess Mobile's plans also start at $15 a month. Depending on the data amount purchased, that base fee can rise to $30 \u2014 but all of its plans similarly offer unlimited talk and text using T-Mobile's network. When launching last week, SmartLess underlined that its goal is to help people stop paying for the data they don't use, noting that the majority of data used by consumers today happens over Wi-Fi.",
      "\u201cSeriously, if your phone bill knew how often you\u2019re on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed,\" Hayes said in a statement for SmartLess Mobile's June 10 launch.",
      "MVNOs have proven to be attractive acquisitions to big wireless carriers over the years. But whether or not the star factor promises significant demand has yet to be seen for the market's most recent entrants.",
      "For the more established Mint Mobile, Reynolds' investment is a success story. The 25% stake that the actor reportedly owned in 2023, when the company announced that it would be acquired by T-Mobile, was estimated to give him a personal windfall of over $300 million in cash and stock. And since that deal closed, Reynolds has remained in his creative role for Mint and as the face of many campaigns \u2014 helping the brand continue to attract new customers.",
      "It's no surprise that the potential of such business returns might attract other celebrities to make similar investments, Bentzin notes. Still, newer ventures are untested. And \"as the market becomes more crowded, it could be harder and harder to pick off individual consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond a high-profile name, quality of service and what consumers can afford is also critical.",
      "\u201cThe competition battleground here is brand and price,\u201d Bentzin said.",
      "Still, if the marketing is right and product meets consumer needs, experts like Garcia Granados note that MVNOs can be a profitable business, for both the brands that start them and the telecommunications giants \u2014 like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T \u2014 offering this \u201cwholesale\u201d access to their infrastructure.",
      "As a result, he said, such high-profile ventures become \u201ca catalyst for others to follow.\"",

      "The problem detailed by the National Transportation Safety Board emerged after two bird strikes involving Southwest Airlines planes in 2023 \u2014 one in Havana, Cuba, and another in New Orleans. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing already warned airlines and pilots about the problem and the engine maker has been working on a fix.",
      "The NTSB said that the engines CFM International makes for the Boeing plane can inadvertently release oil into the hot engine when the safety feature, called a load reduction device, is activated after a bird strike or similar engine issue. The resulting smoke feeds directly into either the cockpit or passenger cabin depending on which engine was struck.",
      "Similar engine models with the same safety feature are also used on Airbus A320neo planes and C919 planes made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. The NTSB urged European and Chinese aviation safety regulators to evaluate those engine models to determine if they could also be susceptible to the smoke problem.",
      "The new safety device that CFM added to its engines solved one problem by limiting damage when an engine starts to come apart, but created a new problem by releasing the oil that burns and generates smoke.",
      "\u201cThis is a case of an unintended consequence of a new and innovative safety idea where if the fan gets unbalanced that this is a way to alleviate the load and thereby doing less damage to the engine, the engine pylon, all of that,\u201d said aviation safety expert John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems consulting firm.",
      "CFM said in a statement that it is \u201caligned with the NTSB\u2019s recommendations and the work is already underway, in close partnership with our airframers, to enhance the capability of this important system.\u201d The company, which is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, confirmed it is working on a software update for the 737 Max\u2019s engines and said it is evaluating similar engine models.",
      "Boeing said it is working with CFM on the update and the planemaker supports NTSB's recommendations. Boeing also updated some of the checklists pilots rely on to help them take appropriate actions.",
      "The NTSB investigated a December 2023 incident in which a Southwest Airlines plane struck a bird while taking off from New Orleans and had to land quickly after thick smoke filled the cockpit \u2014 even making it hard for the pilot to see the instrument panel or his copilot.",
      "In an incident nine months earlier involving another Southwest 737 Max, smoke filled the cabin after a bird strike after takeoff in Havana.",
      "Air from the left engine on a 737 Max flows directly into the cockpit while air from the right engine flows into the passenger cabin.",
      "While these incidents were both bird strikes, the NTSB said this could happen in certain other circumstances.",
      "The FAA said in a statement that it agrees with the NTSB recommendations and when \u201cthe engine manufacturer develops a permanent mitigation, we will require operators to implement it within an appropriate timeframe.\u201d",
      "Pilots can act to limit smoke in the plane by manually cutting off airflow from the engines, but smoke can quickly start to fill the cabin within a few seconds. The engine manufacturer is working on a software update that should do that automatically, but that\u2019s not expected to be ready until sometime in the first quarter of next year.",
      "The NTSB said in its report that several pilots who fly Boeing 737s told investigators they weren't aware of these incidents despite the efforts Boeing and the FAA have made. The NTSB said \u201cit is critical to ensure that pilots who fly airplanes equipped with CFM LEAP-1B engines are fully aware of the potential for smoke in the cockpit.\u201d",
      "Airbus didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the airline has been in close contact with the FAA, Boeing and the engine maker since the incidents and notified its pilots after they happened. The spokesperson said the airline continues to address the issue through its training and safety management systems.",
      "The Boeing 737 Max planes have been the focus since they were involved in both incidents, and there has been a history of other problems with that plane.",
      "The Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for Boeing after two of the jets crashed. The crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killed 346 people.",
      "The problem in those crashes stemmed from a sensor providing faulty readings that pushed the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal to allow Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes.",
      "Worries about the plane flared up again after a door plug blew off a Max operated by Alaska Airlines, leading regulators to cap Boeing\u2019s production at 38 jets per month. The NTSB plans to meet next Tuesday to discuss what investigators found about that incident.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. State Department said Wednesday it is restarting the suspended process for foreigners applying for student visas but all applicants will now be required to unlock their social media accounts for government review.",
      "The department said consular officers will be on the lookout for posts and messages that could be deemed hostile to the United States, its government, culture, institutions or founding principles.",
      "In a notice made public Wednesday, the department said it had rescinded its May suspension of student visa processing but said new applicants who refuse to set their social media accounts to \u201cpublic\u201d and allow them to be reviewed may be rejected. It said a refusal to do so could be a sign they are trying to evade the requirement or hide their online activity.",
      "The Trump administration last month temporarily halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students hoping to study in the U.S. while preparing to expand the screening of their activity on social media, officials said.",
      "Students around the world have been waiting anxiously for U.S. consulates to reopen appointments for visa interviews, as the window left to book their travel and make housing arrangements narrows ahead of the start of the school year.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, a 27-year-old Ph.D. student in Toronto was able to secure an appointment for a visa interview next week. The student, a Chinese national, hopes to travel to the U.S. for a research internship that would start in late July. \u201cI\u2019m really relieved,\u201d said the student, who spoke on condition of being identified only by his surname, Chen, because he was concerned about being targeted. \u201cI\u2019ve been refreshing the website couple of times every day.\u201d",
      "Students from China, India, Mexico and the Philippines have posted on social media sites that they have been monitoring visa booking websites and closely watching press briefings of the State Department to get any indication of when appointment scheduling might resume.",
      "In reopening the visa process, the State Department also told consulates to prioritize students hoping to enroll at colleges where foreigners make up less than 15% of the student body, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail information that has not been made public.",
      "Foreign students make up more than 15% of the total student body at almost 200 U.S. universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal education data from 2023. Most are private universities, including all eight Ivy League schools. But that criteria also includes 26 public universities, including the University of Illinois and Pennsylvania State University. Looking only at undergraduate students, foreign students make up more than 15% of the population at about 100 universities, almost all of them private.",
      "International students in the U.S. have been facing increased scrutiny on several fronts. In the spring, the Trump administration revoked permission to study in the U.S. for thousands of students, including some involved only in traffic offenses, before abruptly reversing course. The government also expanded the grounds on which foreign students can have their legal status terminated.",
      "As part of a pressure campaign targeting Harvard University, the Trump administration has moved to block foreign students from attending the Ivy League school, which counts on international students for tuition dollars and a quarter of its enrollment. Trump has said Harvard should cap its foreign enrollment at 15%.",
      "This latest move to vet students' social media, the State Department said Wednesday, \"will ensure we are properly screening every single person attempting to visit our country.\u201d",
      "In internal guidance sent to consular officers, the department said they should be looking for \u201cany indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.\u201d",
      "Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the new policy evokes the ideological vetting of the Cold War, when prominent artists and intellectuals were excluded from the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis policy makes a censor of every consular officer, and it will inevitably chill legitimate political speech both inside and outside the United States,\" Jaffer said.",
      "The Trump administration also has called for 36 countries to commit to improving vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States. A weekend diplomatic cable sent by the State Department says the countries have 60 days to address U.S. concerns or risk being added to a travel ban that now includes 12 nations.",

      "Three summers from now, flag football will make its Olympic debut at the 2028 LA Games",
      "Being in Los Angeles this weekend, practicing and playing in flag football games, and mentoring younger players, makes it all seem that much more real for quarterback Darrell \u201cHoush\u201d Doucette.",
      "Just three summers from now, his sport will make its Olympic debut at the 2028 LA Games. What the final roster will look like, how many NFL players may be on it, is still being sorted out.",
      "This weekend in LA is simply another chance to showcase flag football. Approximately 900 players from nine countries are taking part in USA Football\u2019s \u201cSummer Series.\u201d No active-roster NFL players are slated to take the field. But that could change down the road after league owners unanimously gave permission in May for players to participate in flag football.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gaining traction,\u201d the 35-year-old Doucette said of his sport, which is currently already part of the NFL's Pro Bowl festivities. \u201cIt\u2019s being talked about on ESPN, the NFL Network. The NFL is putting (resources) behind it. It\u2019s an exciting, fun, fast game.\u201d",
      "The fields at Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles will host tournaments and showcases for players of all ages. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams also play in a series of friendly international matches throughout the weekend.",
      "On top of that, federations will engage in an international high-performance summit. Basically, it\u2019s an exchange of ideas and methodologies to grow the game around the world. The U.S. men and women are both No. 1 in the world, according to the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) rankings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a sports diplomacy going on,\u201d said Scott Hallenbeck, the CEO of USA Football. \u201cThere\u2019s just lots of elements that I think speak really well to the growth of the sport within the Olympic movement and what\u2019s expected within the Olympic movement and the opportunity to all learn from each other as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only three years to the Olympics. ... We all have to go as fast as we can.\"",
      "This is also a chance for the national teams to fine-tune before international competitions. The U.S. squads will compete in September at the IFAF Americas Continental Flag Football Championship in Panama. The women\u2019s team also will play at the World Games in Chengdu, China, in August.",
      "\u201cThe friendlies are more about just seeing where your team is currently at,\u201d Doucette said. \u201cWe are the top dogs, but we can\u2019t go out and treat it that way. We have to keep our foot on the pedal with every game we play.\u201d",
      "Doucette still hopes to be the signal caller for Team USA when the LA Olympics roll around. Sure, he will be 38 at the time, but, hey, Tom Brady was winning Super Bowls beyond that age.",
      "Lately, Doucette has drawn some headlines for his stance on NFL players contending for roster spots. His take remains simple \u2014 beat them out and welcome to the team.",
      "\u201cWe all are family together. We don\u2019t treat each other differently. We all compete and we want the gold medal,\u201d Doucette said. \u201cSo if those (NFL) guys come out and try out, they make the team, congrats to them \u2014 they\u2019re one of us.\"",
      "The games this weekend will be played following the IFAF's 5-on-5 rules. It\u2019s the same version fans will see in LA in 2028.",
      "The field is smaller than an NFL field by about half: 50 yards long \u2014 along with 10 yards for each end zone \u2014 and 25 yards wide. A stop is made by ripping off one of the flags attached by a belt to a ball carrier\u2019s waist. An offensive touchdown is worth six points with the subsequent extra-point attempt varying in value.",
      "There was a time not too long ago when receiver/center/defensive back Ashlea Klam had to explain the sport she plays.",
      "Not anymore. Not after flag football was added to the LA Olympics program, along with cricket, baseball-softball, lacrosse and squash, in October 2023.",
      "With the NFL on board, the visibility has only skyrocketed. Klam plays at Keiser University in Florida, which is one of numerous NAIA schools that now have programs.",
      "Being in LA this weekend, it's hard for Klam not to think about LA 2028.",
      "\u201cI always think about LA 2028,\u201d said Klam, who bypassed scholarship offers in track and field to concentrate on flag football. \u201cI still feel like I\u2019m celebrating, just knowing that it's in the Olympics for real.\u201d",
      "Among the events this weekend:",
      "\u2014 The Select Bowl. This is a chance for U.S. national team coaches to scout and identify rising stars in the sport.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Though many athletic programs outside the power four conferences are expected to drop off competitively when scholarship limits are removed and revenue sharing begins July 1, College World Series finalist Coastal Carolina is committed to continue playing with the big boys in baseball.",
      "Rosters will be capped at 34 in Division I baseball going forward, and first-year athletic director Chance Miller told The Associated Press all 34 at Coastal Carolina would receive full scholarships and be in line for direct rev-share payments. Miller said he also believes the Chanticleers' opportunities for name, image and likeness earnings will compare favorably with those for power conference baseball teams within two years.",
      "Baseball is Coastal Carolina's flagship sport. The Chanticleers have played in 21 NCAA Tournaments since 1991, won the 2016 CWS for their first national championship in any sport, and they'll take a 26-game win streak into the best-of-three finals against LSU starting Saturday night.",
      "Coach Kevin Schnall said the athletic administration's support \u201cat the highest level\u201d is a big reason the Chanticleers are back in Omaha.",
      "\u201cWhat I mean by that is they enabled us to hire an elite coaching staff that would rival any coaching staff in the entire country,\u201d Schnall said. \u201cThey give us the resources to put our players in the best position to become the best players that they can be. And it\u2019s an absolute team effort.\u201d",
      "Miller said the budget has been restructured to allocate more money for scholarships without asking for additional institutional support. He said a significant portion of the revenue sharing for 2025-26 comes from donors, including a \u201ctransformational gift\u201d from one who wished to remain anonymous. A fundraising dinner in Omaha last week brought in $1 million, he said.",
      "Coastal Carolina's baseball players are earning about $200,000 combined in third-party NIL deals this year; retired coach Gary Gilmore noted, \u201cLSU has that much in just one guy.\u201d",
      "Miller said NIL numbers for the next year will be inflated at a lot of power four schools. That's because many NIL deals were paid up front rather than having payments spread out. Athletes and their agents wanted to avoid having to get those valued at $600-plus vetted by the NIL clearinghouse, as required after June 6 when the House settlement was approved.",
      "\u201cWe talked to one of the collectives from a power four school I know very well, and right now they're spending $2.5 million on the (baseball) team and next year they're going to spend $3 million because they frontloaded a lot of NIL money from their collective,\" Miller said. \"The year after that, they\u2019re going to drop down to $500,000. So that\u2019s a drastic drop.\u201d",
      "Miller's charge, like his predecessor's, is to keep Coastal Carolina in the top tier of college baseball.",
      "\u201cThe mentality of our program \u2014 all the way back to Coach Gilmore\u2019s early days in the late 90s \u2014 was geared to reach Omaha,\" said Matt Hogue, who retired as athletic director last year to become director of Coastal Carolina's Center for Sports Broadcasting. \u201cThe way we financially invested, how we scheduled, infrastructure. We always viewed the CWS as the expectation, not a novelty.\u201d",
      "LSU coach Jay Johnson said if there's one non-power conference baseball program able to keep competing for trips to Omaha in the new era of college athletics, it's Coastal Carolina.",
      "\u201cGonzaga basketball, Boise State football. The ones sustainable for decades, that\u2019s who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is no surprise to me we\u2019re playing them. As long as coach Schnall\u2019s there, they\u2019re not going anywhere for a long time.\u201d",

    "summary": "Rutgers freshman Dylan Harper is the headliner among the guards in the upcoming NBA draft",
    "story": [
      "Rutgers freshman Dylan Harper is the headliner among the guards in the upcoming NBA draft",
      "There's a deep set of high-end guard prospects in the upcoming NBA draft.",
      "Rutgers point guard Dylan Harper is positioned to be the first name called after projected No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, while Baylor's VJ Edgecombe, Texas' Tre Johnson, Oklahoma's Jeremiah Fears and Illinois' Kasparas Jakucionis are possible top-10 picks as one-and-done prospects.",
      "Here's a look at the guards entering Wednesday's first round:",
      "STRENGTHS: The 6-foot-5, 213-pound son of former NBA guard Ron Harper has size at the point and two-way potential. The lefty thrived as a scorer (19.4 points) with athleticism to finish at the rim, score on stepbacks and hit catch-and-shoot looks. Notably, he went for 36 points in an overtime win against Notre Dame, then 37 more a day later in a loss to then-No. 9 Alabama during the Players Era Festival in November.",
      "Harper is a playmaker with good court vision, averaging 4.0 assists. He also averaged 1.4 steals, including six against Southern California and four more against a ranked Illinois team in February.",
      "CONCERNS: He shot 33.3% on 3-pointers while launching 5.2 per game, though shot selection against contested looks didn't always help. There\u2019s also the optics of being the NBA-bound floor leader on a team that finished with a losing record despite featuring a second one-and-done talent in forward Ace Bailey.",
      "STRENGTHS: Explosive athleticism stands out at both ends, notably as an above-the-rim finisher who creates highlight-reel moments. The 6-4, 193-pound Edgecombe finished in the combine's top 10 with a 38.5-inch max vertical leap, had seven games with at least three made 3s and 11 games with three-plus steals.",
      "\u201cI think for freshmen, the universal (issue) is just being able to sustain the level of intensity required as long as they\u2019re on the court,\u201d Baylor coach Scott Drew said recently. \u201cThe size, length, speed is one thing, but just to be able to compete each and every play, it\u2019s a different level. And VJ has that.\u201d",
      "CONCERNS: Edgecombe shot just 34% on 3s, though Drew said Edgecombe could see gains after refining his shot mechanics. He could also improve in shot creation, such making just 25% (13 of 59) in off-dribble jumpers, according to Synergy's analytics rankings.",
      "STRENGTHS: The 6-5, 190-pound Johnson averaged 19.9 points to lead all Division I freshmen, as well as being the Southeastern Conference\u2019s overall scoring leader. The highlight was Johnson going for 39 points against Arkansas in February to break Kevin Durant\u2019s Longhorns freshman single-game record.",
      "He thrived off screens (shot 52.1% in those scenarios to rate in the 91st percentile in Synergy) and shot 39.7% from 3-point range, including 12 games with at least four made 3s. He also shot 87.1% at the foul line.",
      "CONCERNS: The 19-year-old could use some bulk on a slender frame to help him hold up against bigger and stronger opponents at both ends.",
      "STRENGTHS: The combo guard pressures defenders with his ball-handling and space creation, averaging 17.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists. He got to the line 6.3 times per game and ranked tied for 11th among all Division I players by making 183 free throws.",
      "Fears also had a knack for clutch plays, including a four-point play to beat a ranked Michigan team along with a tough late scoring drive for the lead in the SEC Tournament loss to Kentucky.",
      "CONCERNS: He needs to get stronger (6-3, 180) and improve his outside shot. He made 28.4% of his 3s, including nine games of going 0 for 3 or worse. Reducing turnovers (3.4) would help, too.",
      "STRENGTHS: Jakucionis brings size (6-5, 205) and an all-around floor game to the perimeter. He averaged 15 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists with four double-digit rebounding games and eight games with at least seven assists.",
      "He was also one of the nation's best freshmen at getting to the foul line (5.1 attempts per game).",
      "CONCERNS: Jakucionis shot just 31.8% on 3s, including 5 of 22 (22.7%) in four bright-spotlight games during the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments. He averaged 3.7 turnovers \u2014 sixth-most in Division I, most among freshmen \u2014 and had 13 games with at least five turnovers.",
      "\u2014 EGOR DEMIN: The BYU freshman from Russia is a possible lottery prospect as a playmaker with size (6-8, 199), known for elite passing and vision. He averaged 5.5 assists to rank second among all Division I freshmen.",
      "\u2014 JASE RICHARDSON: The Michigan State freshman and son of former NBA guard Jason Richardson is small (6-1, 178), though the first-round prospect is a 41.2% 3-point shooter.",
      "\u2014 NOLAN TRAORE: The 6-5, 175-pounder is a scoring playmaker from France. The first-round prospect had previously drawn interest from programs like Duke, Alabama and Gonzaga.",
      "\u2014 NIQUE CLIFFORD: The 6-5, 202-pound Clifford spent three years at Colorado then two at Colorado State. The first-round prospect is older (23) but had career-best numbers last year (18.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 37.7% on 3s).",
      "\u2014 BEN SARAF: The 6-6, 201-pound lefty from Israel is a scoring playmaker and first-round prospect. He averaged 12.8 points and 4.6 assists last season with Ratiopharm Ulm in Germany.",
      "\u2014 CEDRIC COWARD: The 6-5, 213-pound senior started at Division III Willamette, spent two years at Eastern Washington, had an injury-shortened season at Washington State and was set to transfer to Duke. Now he's a first-round prospect after testing well at the combine.",
      "\u2014 WALTER CLAYTON JR.: The 6-2, 199-pound combo guard was a first-team Associated Press All-American and Final Four\u2019s most outstanding player in Florida's national title run. He's a first-round prospect and gamer who thrived in pressure moments.",
      "\u2014 DRAKE POWELL: The North Carolina freshman wing has perimeter size (6-6, 195), athleticism, 3-point range and defensive potential to be a possible first-round pick. He has a 7-foot wingspan and had combine-best marks in standing and max vertical leap.",
      "\u2014 KAM JONES: The Marquette senior and potential first-rounder was a finalist for the Cousy Award presented to the nation's top point guard after averaging 19.2 points and 5.9 assists. He missed two games in his career.",

      "Game 6 of the NBA Finals had been over for only about 10 or 15 minutes, and the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder were turning the page",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Game 6 of the NBA Finals had been over for only about 10 or 15 minutes, and the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder were turning the page. What happened over the previous couple of hours in Indianapolis had already been deemed irrelevant.",
      "The only thing on their minds: Game 7.",
      "\u201cA privilege,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.",
      "\u201cA great privilege,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "A back-and-forth title matchup \u2014 Indiana led 1-0 and 2-1, Oklahoma City led 3-2 \u2014 will end on Sunday night with an ultimate game, the first winner-take-all contest in the NBA Finals since 2016. It'll be Pacers at Thunder, one team getting the Larry O'Brien Trophy when it is over, the other left to head into the offseason wondering how they let the chance slip away.",
      "\u201cWe have one game for everything, for everything we\u2019ve worked for, and so do they,\u201d Thunder guard and reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cThe better team Sunday will win.\u201d",
      "History favors the home team in these moments: 15 of the previous 19 Game 7s in the NBA Finals were won by the club playing on its own court.",
      "The Thunder played a Game 7 at home earlier in these playoffs and won by 32, blowing out Denver to reach the Western Conference finals. Indiana's most recent Game 7 was at Madison Square Garden in last season's Eastern Conference semifinals; the Pacers blew out New York by 21 in that game.",
      "All-time, home teams are 112-38 in Game 7s (excluding the 2-2 record \u201chome\u201d teams had in the bubble in the 2020 playoffs, when everything was played in Lake Buena Vista, Florida). But in recent years, home sweet home has been replaced by road sweet road; visiting teams have won nine of the last 14 Game 7s played since 2021.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting, man. It\u2019s so, so, exciting,\u201d Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cAs a basketball fan, there\u2019s nothing like a Game 7. There\u2019s nothing like a Game 7 in the NBA Finals. Dreamed of being in this situation my whole life. So, to be here is really exciting. Really exciting for our group. What happened in the past doesn\u2019t matter. What happened today doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about one game and approaching that the right way.\"",
      "The fact that Haliburton is playing at all right now is a story in itself. He looked good as new in Game 6 even with a strained right calf, something that he's needed around-the-clock treatment on this week. The Pacers haven't had to coax him into it; Haliburton's own family is offering up constant reminders that he needs to be working on his leg.",
      "\u201cMy family has been on me,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cIf they call me, they are like, \u2018Are you doing treatment right now?\u2019 ... My family has been holding me accountable.\u201d",
      "There's a lot of accountability going on among the Thunder right now as well. A different kind, of course.",
      "They were massive favorites going into Game 6 \u2014 +3000 odds to win the series, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. That means a $100 bet on the Thunder would have returned a whopping $103 or so if they had won the game and clinched the title. A 36-9 run by Indiana turned a one-point lead early in the second quarter into a full-fledged blowout early in the third. And with that, a Thunder team that finished with the best record in the NBA this season now has zero room for error.",
      "Win on Sunday, and all ends well for Oklahoma City. Lose on Sunday, and they'll go down in history as one of the best regular-season teams that failed to win a title.",
      "\u201cIf they had won by one, they would have probably walked out of this game with confidence,\u201d Thunder guard Jalen Williams said of the Pacers before leaving Indy's arena for the final time this season. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes them a good team. That\u2019s what makes us a good team. ... They\u2019re going to go into Game 7 confident, and so are we.\u201d",
      "The Thunder flew home after the game on Thursday night. The Pacers were flying to Oklahoma City on Friday afternoon. They'll spend some time looking at film, then go through the final practices \u2014 which won't be much more than glorified walk-throughs \u2014 of the season on Saturday.",
      "And then, Game 7. For everything.",
      "\u201cI think we played to exhaustion,\u201d Pacers guard T.J. McConnell said after Game 6. \u201cBut we have to do it again on Sunday.\u201d",

The Giants got better with (Rafael) Devers, and we know what these guys have on the other side. And what we have on this side. And obviously you can\u2019t count out Arizona. They\u2019ve got a really good team over there. They\u2019re going to be battling. It\u2019s a four-headed monster battling it out, so it\u2019ll be an interesting second half.\u201d",

      "Bangladesh held the upper hand at the end of Day 4 of the series-opening cricket test against Sri Lanka, reaching 177-3 in their second innings to lead by 187 runs",
      "GALLE, Sri Lanka -- Bangladesh held the upper hand at the end of Day 4 of the series-opening cricket test against Sri Lanka, reaching 177-3 in their second innings to lead by 187 runs Friday.",
      "With seven wickets in the hutch and the pitch beginning to show signs of wear and tear, the tourists will fancy their chances of pulling off a rare test victory overseas and pocketing some precious World Test Championship points in the process.",
      "Having eked out a slender first-innings lead of 10 runs, Bangladesh batted with the sort of positive intent that suggests they were not content to merely survive.",
      "Shadman Islam set the tone, first putting on 24 for the opening wicket with Anamul Haque and then 36 more with Mominul Haque. But it was his third-wicket partnership \u2014 a sturdy 68-run stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto \u2014 that truly swung momentum Bangladesh\u2019s way.",
      "Shadman\u2019s knock of 76 was fashioned with composure and clarity, the left-hander repelling spin and pace alike with soft hands and a watchful eye. He looked set for three figures before Milan Rathnayake trapped him in front, but by then the groundwork had been laid.",
      "In strode the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim and together with his skipper \u2014 both centurions in the first innings \u2014 the pair steadied the ship and nudged the lead beyond 150, blunting Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes of a late-evening flurry.",
      "Earlier in the day, it was off-spinner Nayeem Hasan who turned the tide for the tourists in Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings.",
      "With the hosts perched on a commanding 470-6 and threatening to surge ahead, Nayeem swooped in. His five-wicket haul \u2014 his fourth in test cricket \u2014 was a masterclass in flight, dip and guile, as he rattled the lower order to bowl Sri Lanka out for 485, a lead of merely 10.",
      "The prized wicket was Kamindu Mendis, who had become something of a recurring nightmare for Bangladesh. The ambidextrous maestro was coasting on 87 \u2014 scarcely playing a false stroke \u2014 when Nayeem found extra bounce and subtle turn to kiss the outside edge, Litton Das gobbling up the catch with glee.",
      "\"My variation was the key,\" Nayeem said. \u201cMain thing is I tried to bowl at one area and keep changing the seam position. When you do that over a long period of time, your discipline pays off. ... Depending on the batsman, I tried to vary the lines. Tried to bowl different lines to different batters and it paid off.\u201d",
      "Hasan Mahmud, meanwhile, proved a perfect foil, bowling with control and reverse swing under the afternoon sun, finishing with three wickets and keeping the pressure on from the other end. Together, they orchestrated a collapse of four wickets for just 15 runs \u2014 the kind of passage of play that can flip a test match on its head.",
      "Kamindu Mendis expressed confidence looking ahead.",
      "\u201cOur first target is to get their wickets. Our target is also to win the game. If we can bowl them out in the first session, we can chase that down,\u201d he said. \"Whatever the score they get, we have another two sessions. We can still do this.",
      "\u201cGalle pitch the fourth day towards the end it will spin,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we saw it spinning only in the first hour or so today. Later on in the day it got settled. We have to asses things with the way the wicket behaves.\u201d",

After winning an Olympic gold medal last summer, he wanted to give the city of Indianapolis the kind of celebration it would never forget. And now the Pacers are one win away from making it really happen.",

      "Defender Chris Richards scored with a flick of the ball off a second-half free kick to lift the United States to a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Thursday night, sending the Americans on to the quarterfinals",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Defender Chris Richards scored with a flick of the ball off a second-half free kick to lift the United States to a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Thursday night, sending the Americans on to the CONCACAF Gold Cuo quarterfinals.",
      "Richards tracked the ball as it flew into the box on a curving free kick from Sebastian Berhalter in the 62nd minute to tap the ball with his left foot past Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Nawaf Al Aquidi.",
      "The win and the 1-1 draw between Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti in Group D's other match Thursday in Houston, clinched a knockout berth for the Americans, who improved to 42 wins, one loss and five draws in group play. The U.S. has won its group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, and closes Group D play on Sunday against Haiti at Arlington, Texas.",
      "U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino stuck with the same lineup that produced a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the first time he made no changes in consecutive matches since taking over the program last October. But playing against No. 58 Saudi Arabia, the 16th-ranked Americans showed little of the attack firepower they displayed against the No. 100 Soca Warriors.",
      "The match saw few real chances on goal by either team. The Americans had just one shot in the first half. Richards' speed to track back to cover for Alex Freeman's mistake and block a shot kept Saudi Arabia from a 1-0 lead.",
      "Matt Freese got his second consecutive start in goal for the U.S. and third in four matches as he appears to have displaced Matt Turner.",
      "The Gold Cup represents the last competitive test for the Americans ahead of the 2026 World Cup. As co-host with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. is an automatic qualifier for the World Cup.",
      "The Americans limped into the Gold Cup on a four-match losing streak that included a 4-0 rout by Switzerland in their final tune-up. And with many of the top players either sitting out this tournament for personal reasons, injuries or playing in the Club World Cup, Pochettino selected a roster full of relatively untested and unproven players.",
      "Missing the tournament for the U.S. are regulars Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergi\u00f1o Dest,",

      "The run was 36-9 \u2014 repeat, 36-9 \u2014 and just like that, a team that won 68 games in the regular season and finished with the best record in the NBA has been pushed to the brink by an Indiana team that finished 18 games back of the Thunder in the league standings.",
      "They\u2019re even now: The series is 3-3, and it all comes down to Sunday.",
      "During that 36-9 run, the Thunder were offensively inept: They shot 3 for 18 during those minutes, with seven turnovers in there to make matters even worse.",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

      "BOSTON -- Attorneys argued over whether a Harvard researcher accused of smuggling frog embryos brought \u201cbiological materials\u201d into the U.S. in a court hearing Wednesday.",
      "Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist conducting cancer research for Harvard Medical School, appeared in Massachusetts federal court Wednesday for a probable cause hearing, where government and defense attorneys argued over whether she brought \u201cbiological materials\u201d into the U.S., ABC News reported.",
      "She was returning from a vacation from France in February when she was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Boston Logan International Airport.",
      "Petrova, 30, had stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of frog embryos and obtained a package of samples for research. Federal officials on the social media website X accused her of lying about \u201ccarrying substances\u201d into the country and alleged that she planned to smuggle the embryos through customs without declaring them.",
      "She told The Associated Press in an interview in April that she did not realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak anything into the country.",
      "Petrova was told her visa was being canceled and detained by immigration officials in Vermont after her initial arrest. She filed a petition seeking her release and was briefly sent to an ICE facility in Louisiana, after which a judge ruled the immigration officers\u2019 actions were unlawful. In May, she was charged with one count of smuggling.",
      "The Homeland Security Investigations agent who wrote the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, Brian Goldsworthy, testified Wednesday that Petrova would not have been able to leave the airport had she declared the frog embryos in her luggage, ABC News reported.",
      "He said that Customs and Border Protection agriculture experts and a federal laboratory that reviewed the samples deemed them to be biological material, ABC News reported. Petrova's attorney argued it was unclear what definition the government was operating under and the requirement to declare items entering the country doesn't hinge on whether something is a biological material, ABC News reported.",
      "After Wednesday's hearing, both sides will now have the opportunity to submit briefs to the judge.",
      "If convicted of the smuggling charge, Petrova faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "NEW YORK -- An Australian moth follows the stars during its yearly migration, using the night sky as a guiding compass, according to a new study.",
      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",
      "It's an impressive feat for Bogong moths whose brains are smaller than size of a grain of rice to rely on the night sky for their odyssey, said study author David Dreyer with Lund University in Sweden.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",

The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",

      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",

      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen.

Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",

The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "A grand jury in Colorado has returned an indictment against Barry Morphew, charging him with the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, officials announced Friday.",
      "Suzanne Morphew went missing on a bike ride on Mother's Day in May 2020. Her remains were found more than three years later while investigators were searching in an unrelated case. Her death was subsequently ruled a homicide.",
      "Her husband, Barry Morphew, was charged with her murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped in April 2022 just before a trial was supposed to begin.",
      "The grand jury returned the indictment against Morphew on Wednesday. He was taken into custody in Arizona and will be extradited to the San Luis Valley to face charges, according to the Twelfth Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"Federal, State and local law enforcement have never stopped working toward justice for Suzanne,\" Twelfth Judicial District Attorney Anne Kelly said in a statement on Friday. \"The Twelfth Judicial District Attorney's Office stands in solidarity with Suzanne's family and the citizens of Chaffee and Saguache Counties in pursuing the Grand Jury's indictment.\"",
      "Barry Morphew was the last person to see his wife alive, according to the probable cause statement in the indictment.",
      "In early interviews with law enforcement following his wife's disappearance, Barry Morphew allegedly said their marriage was \"the best,\" according to the indictment. Though his statements were \"inconsistent with other witness accounts and evidence located,\" the indictment stated, noting that Suzanne Morphew had \"confided in people that she was unhappy in the marriage in the weeks and months leading to her disappearance\" and had discussed plans to divorce her husband with a close friend.",
      "Investigators also uncovered a screenshot of a text message from Suzanne Morphew on her husband's phone that stated, according to the indictment: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\" The screenshot was saved on May 6, 2020 -- four days before she was reported missing by a neighbor, according to the indictment.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's body was found in September 2023 near the town of Moffat, about 90 minutes south of where she lived.",
      "Her death was determined to have been caused by homicide \"by undetermined means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication,\" according to the autopsy.",
      "Law enforcement specifically requested that the coroner's office test for the presence of butorphanol, azaperone and medetomidine, which comprise a chemical mixture known as BAM that is used for sedating animals, according to the indictment.",
      "Prior to moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry Morphew was a deer farmer in Indiana and used BAM to sedate and transport deer on his farm, according to the indictment. He allegedly admitted to using BAM in Colorado as recently as April 2020 to tranquilize a deer on his property, according to the indictment.",
      "According to the indictment, records of BAM prescriptions showed that Barry Morphew last purchased BAM by prescription in March 2018, and that no individual or business in the Colorado region where the Morphews lived and where Suzanne Morphew's remains were found had purchased BAM prescriptions from 2017 to 2020.",
      "\"Ultimately, he prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew,\" the indictment stated.",
      "Barry Morphew has denied any involvement in his wife's death.",
      "He and his daughters spoke to ABC News in May 2023 after they filed a lawsuit against prosecutors, saying he was wrongfully charged.",
      "\"They've got tunnel vision and they looked at one person and they've got too much pride to say they're wrong and look somewhere else,\" he said at the time. \"I don't have anything to worry about. I've done nothing wrong.\"",

      "It has everything it needs to do so now, Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "The White House on Thursday stated definitively that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in \"a couple of weeks\" once given the go-ahead from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\"Let's be very clear, Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at her briefing. \"All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that.\"",
      "\"And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would, of course, pose an existential threat not just to Israel but to the United States and to the entire world,\" she continued.",
      "How close Iran is to developing a usable nuclear weapon has been at the center of the Israel-Iran conflict, with continuing debate over the potential \"breakout timeline\" once the nation has stockpiled enough weapons-grade enriched uranium.",
      "The last time the U.S. gave an official, public breakout timeline was in July 2024 when then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it would take Iran one to two weeks to enrich enough uranium of 90% purity to get the fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"Once you're at 60 [percent enrichment], you're 90% of the way there. You are, in essence, a threshold nuclear weapons state, which is what Iran basically has become,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last month.",
      "But if Iran were to produce enough weapons-grade uranium, most experts estimate it would take Iran between several months to two years to actually make a deliverable nuclear warhead.",
      "In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community concluded the Iranians were not \"building\" a nuclear bomb and that the supreme leader had not yet authorized one to be built.",
      "Trump, when asked about Gabbard's testimony this week, dismissed it, saying: \"I don\u2019t care what she said, I think they were very close to having one.\" Gabbard then insisted she and Trump were on the same page -- that Iran was \"close\" to obtaining a weapon -- and that her testimony was misconstrued.",
      "The intelligence community, though, did assess that Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was at its highest level and was unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons, Gabbard testified.",
      "All eyes are on what Trump will do next as Israel and Iran continue to trade strikes, which Israel said it will intensify after an Iranian missile hit a hospital in Beersheba.",
      "The White House said on Thursday he would make a choice on whether to take military action against Tehran within the next two weeks.",
      "\"'Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.' That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Trump's met with advisers in the Situation Room three times this week after departing the G7 summit early due to tensions in the Middle East. He approved attack plans presented to him but was waiting to see if Iran would be willing to negotiate and hasn't made a final decision, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "He's set for another Situation Room meeting on Friday before attending a private fundraiser that night in Bedminster, New Jersey, before returning to the White House Saturday afternoon where he will get more intelligence briefings that evening and Sunday evening.",
      "Leavitt said that Trump's decision would be partly based on his \"instincts\" as he faces different pressures from all sides, including a split in his Republican base between isolationists and Israel hawks.",
      "\"Look, the president hears all voices across the country, and he makes decisions based on his instincts,\" Leavitt said. \"And he has always said diplomacy is his first option.\"",
      "ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Leavitt what made Trump believe there's a substantial chance for negotiation, but Leavitt declined to lay out his thinking.",
      "\"I'm not going to get into the reasoning and the rationale,\" she said. \"The president believes that, but that's his position and he will make a decision within the next two weeks.\"",
      "The White House said correspondence has continued between the United States and the Iranians, though it wasn't tracking whether U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff would attend talks in Geneva between European leaders and the Iranians.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel on Thursday made strong statements saying Iran's supreme leader cannot continue to \"exist\" -- prompting questions of whether Israel now wants regime change in Iran. Leavitt was asked on Thursday whether the U.S. would get involved in such a scenario.",
      "\"The president's top priority right now is ensuring that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon and providing peace and stability in the Middle East,\" Leavitt said.",

      "The second Black Conservative Federation Solution Summit will be held July 11-12, bringing together elected officials, influencers, policy experts and strategists for what organizers hope will be a series of \"bold, solution-driven conversations\" on the most urgent issues facing Black America today.",

      "The summit comes after President Donald Trump made modest gains with Black voters nationwide in 2024, especially among young Black men, a key demographic for Democrats, according to the Associated Press. Black voters made up about 1 in 10 voters nationally in the last 2024 presidential election.",
      "Although roughly 8 in 10 Black voters supported Vice President Kamala Harris, that marked a dip from the roughly 9 in 10 who backed President Joe Biden just four years earlier.

      "The summit will focus on six key topics: artificial intelligence and its role in shaping the future; criminal justice reform and policy transformation; cryptocurrency and Black economic empowerment; strengthening the Black family; navigating modern cultural debates; and Gen Z's influence in politics and media.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. still provides around 30% of Ukraine's weaponry, Zelenskyy has said.",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump -- frustrated by the failure of his diplomatic efforts to date -- has raised the prospect of entirely abandoning U.S. engagement in Russia's 3-year-old invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"Sometimes you see two young children fighting in the park,\" Trump said in June about the ongoing war, which is the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "\"Sometimes you're better off letting them fight more before you pull them apart,\" the president added -- his remarks the latest in several months of public skepticism over the U.S. continuing to back Ukraine.",
      "In practice and rhetoric, American aid to Ukraine appears to be drying up. The administration approved a $50 million sale of military aid to Ukraine in April, but only after Kyiv signed off on a controversial minerals sharing deal. But the White House is also yet to dip into some $3.9 billion earmarked to fund military aid to Ukraine -- to be drawn from existing U.S. stocks, meaning it can be delivered quickly -- that Biden was not able to spend before the end of his term.",
      "It would be Russia that would benefit from a permanent halt to U.S. aid, Ukraine has warned.",
      "\"Without American weaponry, the situation on the battlefield will of course be more difficult,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News.",
      "Zelenskyy said early this year that American aid accounts for 30% of Ukrainian weaponry. Though other estimates go as low as 20%, it is clear that Washington remains a key benefactor.",
      "A nine-month pause on U.S. aid in 2024, due to a gridlocked Congress, forced Kyiv to consider a future without American assistance. Those fears materialized in March 2025 when Trump imposed a week-long freeze on all American military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.",
      "The flow soon resumed, but Trump's frustration has only deepened as U.S.-brokered peace talks floundered.",
      "The U.S. remained the most generous single contributor of aid to Ukraine as of April 2025, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group based in Germany that tracks support from foreign governments toward Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. has contributed around $130 billion in total aid to Ukraine since 2022, of which $74 billion is military assistance. Combined, European Union nations have contributed more overall -- $157 billion -- but less than the U.S. on the military front, at slightly less than $73 billion.",
      "Ukraine's budget for military and security spending approved by lawmakers in late 2024 was around $53.7 billion.",
      "Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., told ABC News that American military assistance is important but not vital.",
      "\"I wouldn't underestimate it, but I wouldn't overestimate it either,\" he said. Around half of American weapons systems and ammunition provided could be replaced by alternatives, he said.",
      "How to find replacements for weapons the U.S. would withhold may be the most salient question, Pavel Luzin -- an analyst at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts -- told ABC News.",
      "\"The previous administration decided that the American taxpayers should\" shoulder the burden, he said. \"The current administration wants to share this burden.\"",
      "\"Europe can pay for the American arms for Ukraine and it has enough money for this,\" Luzin said. \"Ukraine also can pay for the arms using long-term European and/or American loans. Even the Russian frozen assets could be used for this purpose.\"",
      "Europe has been criticized for its slow mobilization of its vast resources. But Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and the founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told ABC News, \"I think we saw during the during the pandemic, for example, and after the Russian invasion, that Europe is initially slow to act, but then it can act decisively.\"",
      "Perhaps the most vital single U.S. weapon system now in Ukrainian hands is the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has proven its value in downing drones, ballistic missiles and Russian aircraft since arriving in the country in the spring of 2023.",
      "Ukraine now fields at least six Patriots, two of which were provided by the U.S. and the others by different NATO allies.",
      "Ukraine has other air defense platforms -- among them the European IRIS-T and SAMP-T systems -- but none have been so publicly celebrated by Ukraine for blunting Russian attacks. The system, which entered U.S. service in the 1980s, has even been able to shoot down Russian hypersonic missiles.",
      "Zelenskyy said this month that his nation needs to \"urgently\" strengthen its air defense capabilities in response to Russia's intensifying missile and drone attacks on cities nationwide.",
      "\"We urgently need positive signals from the United States -- concrete signals regarding air defense systems,\" he said. \"We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help -- concrete signals, not words.\"",
      "Danylyuk said air defense is one area in which American support is particularly key.",
      "American-made defenses help enhance Kyiv's security in particular, he said. Without them, \"Kyiv would be hit in the same way as Odesa or Zaporizhizha,\" Danylyuk said.",
      "\"That's not nice. It will make life -- especially for Western diplomats including the U.S. diplomats -- much worse,\" he continued. \"Will it change our will to fight? No. There will be more civilians dying, that's the only difference.\"",
      "Behind and far above the front line, America's enormous intelligence capabilities have also been helping Kyiv resist Russia's war. American reconnaissance flights over eastern Europe, for example, have offered Kyiv otherwise unattainable forewarning on Russian activity and assistance in targeting.",
      "The Center for Strategic and International Studies said in May that U.S. intelligence aid has been \"extensive,\" including signals, imagery and human intelligence. \"This support has enabled Ukraine to counter missile barrages, disrupt covert operations and track force movements,\" CSIS wrote.",
      "Notably, Ukraine's air raid alerts are heavily informed by U.S. satellite data. When intelligence sharing was frozen in March, Ukrainian politicians warned that the result would be more dead civilians from Russia's nightly barrages.",
      "Shell hunger has also been a major problem for both sides throughout the war. Russia has turned to North Korea and Iran for sustenance, while Ukraine has turned to the West. During President Joe Biden's term, the U.S. sent more than 3 million 155mm shells to Ukraine. Any loss of supply could prove deadly for frontline Ukrainian units.",
      "The disappearance of other weapons from the battlefields would serve as a potent signal of an American pivot.",
      "Kyiv relies on the U.S. for ammunition for the HIMARS rocket artillery system, for example, including the long-range ATACMS.",
      "British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile, Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs, M777 howitzers, AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles and F-16 fighter jets are all systems either produced by the U.S. or relying on American components and systems -- thus giving Washington power to veto their transfer to Kyiv.",
      "An end to American aid, Danylyuk said, \"Would create some problems,\" though would not \"be a complete disaster\" if Kyiv is able to quickly source replacements.",
      "Regardless, \"Ukraine is not going to collapse,\" Danylyuk said, recalling the two past windows during which American aid flows froze over.",
      "\"We could survive that terrible nine months without U.S. aid. So, it's not like Ukrainians are going to surrender.\"",

      "Trump said Thursday, via White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, that he believes there's a \"substantial chance of negotiations\" between Israel and Iran, and will make a decision on escalations within the next two weeks.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized American involvement in wars overseas and vowed to shift the focus inward, but as he weighs whether the U.S. will be involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran, some of his supporters have accused him of going back on his anti-interventionist stance.",
      "\"Among the America First base -- which is the core of his base -- there is tremendous anger and a severe sense of betrayal,\" Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the noninterventionist foreign policy think tank Quincy Institute, told ABC News Wednesday. \"This is exactly the type of foreign policy Trump had promised to end, not boost.\"",

      "Some Republicans are attempting to preempt military action through legislative means. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie announced on Tuesday that he had introduced a bill with Democratic Rep.

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",

      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago notes the contradiction of Barcelona\u2019s Mayor Jaume Collboni backing the expansion of the city's international airport \u2014 announced this week \u2014 while still planning to wipe out the tourist apartments.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "A high school in the New York City suburbs has a high number of twins set to graduate this year",
      "HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- A high school in the suburbs of New York City will be seeing double on graduation day this weekend: Among the nearly 500 students in its graduating class, 30 are twins.",
      "It\u2019s a tight knit group. Some of the students at Long Island's Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School have known each other since kindergarten, their parents meeting through a local twins club. Some even still plan family vacations together.",
      "These days, some of the twins are on a group text chain, which has helped them cope with their newfound notoriety as graduation day approaches.",
      "\u201cHonestly when we\u2019re together, the room is electric,\u201d said Sydney Monka, as she attended graduation rehearsal with the other twins earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019re all very comfortable around each other and we all have these shared experiences so we\u2019re all bouncing off each other. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d",
      "Save for the shared last names, though, the pairs may be hard to spot as they walk the stage Sunday at their high school graduation, held at Hofstra University in Hempstead.",
      "The students are all fraternal twins \u2014 meaning born from different eggs and sperm \u2014 so none of them are identical. Many of the twins are different genders.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the bonds any less tight, says Bari Cohen, who is attending Indiana University in the fall.",
      "\u201cEspecially for boy-girl twins, a lot of people think it\u2019s just, like, siblings, but it\u2019s more than that, because we go through the same things at the same time,\u201d she said of her brother, Braydon Cohen, who is headed to the University of Pittsburgh.",
      "Most, when prodded, give a playful shrug at the curious phenomenon in the high school, which is located in an affluent, largely white district about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI guess there\u2019s just something in the water,\u201d said Emily Brake, who is attending the University of Georgia, echoing a common refrain among the twins.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all just very lucky. I think it\u2019s just a coincidence,\u201d added her sister, Amanda Brake, who will be attending Ohio State University.",
      "Others acknowledge there\u2019s more than Mother Nature at work.",
      "Arianna Cammareri said her parents had been trying for years to have kids and in vitro fertilization was their last option. Back then, it was more common than it is now for IVF babies to be twins or triplets.",
      "There also may be a genetic component at play.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few twins in our family, like I have cousins that are twins, so I guess that raised the chances of having twins,\u201d added the incoming freshman at Stony Brook University, also on Long Island.",
      "Large cohorts of twins are not unusual at Plainview-Old Bethpage. The high school had back-to-back graduating classes with 10 sets of multiples in 2014 and 2015, and next year's incoming freshmen class has nine sets of twins, according to school officials.",
      "Among the other schools around the country with big sets of graduating twins are Clovis North High School in Fresno, California, with 14 pairs, and Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland, with 10 pairs.",
      "Last year, a middle school in suburban Boston had 23 sets of twins in its graduating class, though that's still far shy of the record for most multiples in the same academic class. New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, had a whopping 44 twin pairs and a set of triplets in 2017, according to Guinness World Records.",
      "Most of the twins at Plainview-Old Bethpage are heading off to different colleges.",
      "An exception is Aiden and Chloe Manzo, who will both attend the University of Florida, where they\u2019ll live in the same dormitory on campus and both study business, though with different majors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see each other a lot,\u201d Chloe said wryly.",
      "\u201cDeep down, my mom knew it would be easier if we went to the same school,\u201d she added. \u201cYou know, like moving in, graduation, going to sports games.\u201d",
      "Some were apprehensive about living far from their longtime partner in crime.",
      "Emma and Kayla Leibowitz will be attending Binghamton and Syracuse University, respectively. The fifth generation twins say they\u2019re already making plans for frequent visits even though the upstate New York schools are some 80 miles (130 kilometers) apart.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be really weird because we really do everything together. She\u2019s my best friend. I really can\u2019t do anything without her,\u201d said Emma.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sleeping over every weekend. I\u2019m coming for football games \u2014 like all of it,\" said Kayla.",
      "Others were looking forward to getting some breathing room.",
      "Sydney and Kayla Jasser said they\u2019re both studying fashion design \u2014 but at different colleges. Sydney is attending the University of Delaware while Kayla will be attending Indiana University.",
      "\u201cWe could have went to the same college, but we just wanted to be able to be independent since we\u2019ve been with each other forever,\u201d Kayla said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get out there and have our own experiences.\u201d",

      "The pilot of the Universal Stinson 108 and a passenger were killed in the June 3 crash near Sugar Valley Airport in Mocksville, officials said. A second passenger was seriously injured in the crash.",
      "A communications operator looking out the airport office window advised the pilot that there was a turtle on the runway, according to the report released this week. The operator reported that the pilot landed about 1,400 feet (427 meters) down the 2,424-foot (739-meter) runway, then lifted the right main wheel to avoid the turtle. The operator heard the pilot advance the throttle after raising the wheel, but the airplane left her view after that.",
      "A man cutting the grass at the end of the runway reported seeing the pilot raise the right wheel to avoid the turtle, then the wings rocked back and forth and the plane took off again, according to the report. The man lost sight of the plane and then he heard a crash and saw smoke.",
      "The plane crashed in a heavily forested area about 255 feet (78 meters) from the runway and caught fire, officials said. The plane was wedged between several trees and remained in one piece except for a few pieces of fabric found in a nearby stream. It came to rest on its left side with the left wing folded underneath the fuselage and the right wing bent toward the tail.",
      "Preliminary reports contain facts collected on scene, but don\u2019t speculate on probable causes, according to the NTSB\u2019s website. Those are included in final reports, which can take one to two years to complete.",

      "Democrats in Virginia have built up a hefty fundraising advantage for their effort to reclaim the governor's mansion in November's general election",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats in Virginia have built up a hefty fundraising advantage for their effort to reclaim the governor's mansion in a November election that is seen as a bellwether for the party in power in Washington ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA spy turned congresswoman, has a more than 2-to-1 fundraising advantage over her GOP opponent for governor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has struggled to draw support from her fellow Republicans. Both were unopposed for their party's nominations and were able to focus on the fall general election without having to overcome a challenge in this week's primaries. The match-up means Virginia is all but certain to elect the state\u2019s first female governor.",
      "Spanberger has amassed $6.5 million toward her campaign for governor over the last two months after raising $6.7 million between January and March, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Combined with the money Spanberger raised in 2024, she has gathered $22.8 million and still has $14.3 million in her coffers.",
      "Earle-Sears, meanwhile, spent more than she earned between April and June, bringing in $3.5 million and spending $4.6 million. Between January and March, she also raised a little over $3.1 million. In total, she has raked in nearly $9.2 million since launching her campaign last September. Now, she has a little under $3 million in the bank, according to Virginia Public Access Project data.",
      "In a statement, Earle-Sears' campaign said the candidate is putting forward a message for Virginians that money can't buy.",
      "\u201cClearly the Spanberger campaign needs a lot of help attempting to erase Abigail\u2019s bad voting record on issues that actually matter to Virginians,\" press secretary Peyton Vogel said in an email. \u201cThis race isn\u2019t being bought \u2014 it\u2019s being built on a message that matters.\u201d",
      "Virginia is one of two states, along with New Jersey, that host statewide elections this year. The contests will be closely watched as a measure of whether voters in the shadow of Washington will embrace President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive effort to overhaul the federal government, or be repelled by it.",
      "Democrats\u2019 outsized fundraising lead ahead of the primaries may reflect local Democratic enthusiasm and the party's ability to push people to the polls in light of Trump being in office. Mark J. Rozell, dean of George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government, also referenced the noticeable frostiness among leading state Republicans. The party\u2019s statewide nominees have yet to campaign together, despite securing their nominations at the end of April.",
      "\u201cEnthusiasm drives fundraising and in Virginia right now the Democrats\u2019 voting base has much greater enthusiasm\u201c than Republicans, Rozell said. \u201dIt is reminiscent of Trump\u2019s first term in office when Democratic fundraising and ultimately voting overwhelmed the Republicans in Virginia.\u201d",
      "Money does not guarantee success, however. In the last Virginia governor's race, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe outspent Republican Glenn Youngkin, who had invested $20 million of his own money in the race. Youngkin still clinched the election by nearly two points.",
      "Youngkin, who is term-limited from seeking reelection, has offered more than $21,000 in support to Earle-Sears through his political action committee.",
      "When asked whether he would donate more, his PAC responded, \u201cGovernor Youngkin is working to elect the entire GOP ticket and is urging all Virginians to support the commonsense team this November to keep Virginia winning.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' fundraising advantage isn't confined to the governor's race.",
      "State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, who eked out a primary win in a close three-way contest for lieutenant governor, raised nearly $1.8 million in her primary race and has $462,000 remaining.",
      "The Republican nominee, conservative talk-radio host John Reid, raised nearly $312,000 since launching his campaign and has $116,000 remaining.",
      "The only statewide GOP candidate with a fundraising lead, incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, has $2.3 million in the bank after raising a total of $4.6 million. His Democratic opponent, Jay Jones, has raised $2.7 million. He had about $493,000 left at the beginning of June, reports show.",
      "This year, all three Democratic statewide candidates are backed by Clean Virginia, a political group that pushes for clean energy and often takes on legislative challenges against Dominion Energy, Virginia\u2019s largest utility.",

      "Faced with mounting lawsuits over a popular pistol, New Hampshire-based gunmaker Sig Sauer has gotten protection in the form of a new state law that makes it harder to take the manufacturer to court",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Faced with mounting lawsuits over a popular pistol, New Hampshire-based Sig Sauer asked for \u2014 and got \u2014 protection in the form of a new state law that makes it harder to take the gunmaker to court.",
      "Supporters in the Republican-led Legislature said the law was needed to help a major employer. The lawsuits say Sig Sauer's P320 pistol can go off without the trigger being pulled, an allegation the company denies.",
      "The law covers all gun manufacturers and federal firearm licensees in product liability claims regarding the \u201cabsence or presence\u201d of four specific safety features. One of those features is an external mechanical safety that people suing Sig Sauer say should be standard on the P320, based on its design. Claims can still be filed over manufacturing defects.",
      "Those who have sued Sig Sauer in New Hampshire and elsewhere include police, federal law enforcement officers, and other experienced gun users from multiple states who say they were wounded by the gun.",
      "The manufacturer has prevailed in some cases. It is appealing two recent multimillion-dollar verdicts against it, in Pennsylvania and Georgia.",
      "George Abrahams a U.S. Army veteran and painting contractor in Philadelphia who won his case, said he had holstered his P320, put it in the pocket of his athletic pants and zipped it up before going downstairs.",
      "\"All I did was come down the stairway and there was a loud explosion, and then the excruciating pain and bleeding,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2022. He said the bullet tore through his right thigh.",
      "The company, which employs over 2,000 people in a state with permissive gun laws, says the P320 has internal safety mechanisms and \u201chas undergone the most rigorous testing and evaluation of any firearm, by military and law enforcement agencies around the world.\" It says the problem is user error or incompatible holsters, not the design.",
      "\u201cDo you want people to be able to sue car manufacturers because they sell cars that don\u2019t have air conditioning?\u201d state Rep. Terry Roy, a Republican from Deerfield, told the House during debate in May.",
      "Opponents criticized the bill as a special exemption in liability law that has never been granted to any other New Hampshire company.",
      "\u201cI think there is a difference between helping out a large employer and creating an exemption that actually hurts people and doesn\u2019t give them their day in court,\u201d state Rep. David Meuse, a Democrat from Portsmouth, said in an interview. His district covers Newington, where Sig Sauer is headquartered.",
      "A 2005 federal law gives the gun industry broad legal immunity. New Hampshire was already among 32 states that have adopted gun immunity laws in some form, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Some states also have repealed gun industry immunity statutes or weakened them.",
      "A Sig Sauer executive asked New Hampshire lawmakers for help in April, two weeks after a Pennsylvania-based law firm filed its most recent lawsuit in federal court in Concord on March 26 over the design of the P320. The firm represents over 100 people who have filed such lawsuits, including more than 70 in New Hampshire.",

      "The measure took effect once Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed it on May 23. Legislators said it doesn\u2019t apply to the current lawsuits. However, lawyers for Sig Sauer mentioned it as part of their argument to dismiss the March case or break up and transfer the claims of 22 plaintiffs to court districts where they live. A hearing on the matter is set for July 21.",
      "Ayotte\u2019s office did not respond to an AP request seeking comment, but it told The Keene Sentinel that she\u2019s \u201cproud to protect New Hampshire companies that create thousands of good-paying jobs from frivolous lawsuits.\u201d",
      "\u201cOut-of-state trial lawyers looking to make money will not find a venue in New Hampshire,\u201d Ayotte's office said in an emailed statement to the newspaper.",
      "Robert Zimmerman, the plaintiffs' lead attorney in Pennsylvania, said the goal of the lawsuits is to get the weapon's design changed so that it's safe for the people who use it.",
      "New Hampshire was the chosen location because federal rules allow lawsuits against a company in its home state, Zimmerman said. Those lawsuits have been assigned to one federal judge in Concord.",
      "\u201cSig is trying to strategically decentralize this case and make every client go to 100 different courthouses and slow down the process for both sides to get a just outcome, which is a trial that is decided on the merits,\u201d Zimmerman said in an interview.",
      "The lawsuits accuse Sig Sauer of defective product design and marketing and negligence.",
      "During the House debate, Roy said he owns a P320 and it\u2019s one of his favorite guns, \u201cbut you can buy them with or without safeties.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs say \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of P320 models sold don\u2019t come with the safety, \u201ceven as an option.\u201d",
      "Sig Sauer says some users prefer the faster draw time granted by the absence of an external safety; others want the feature for added security.",
      "Sig Sauer offered a \u201cvoluntary upgrade\u201d in 2017 to include an alternate design that reduces the weight of the trigger, among other features. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers say the upgrade did not stop unintentional discharges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a great look\u201d when a manufacturer can carve out a statutory exemption for itself, but it\u2019s also not unusual, said Daniel Pi, an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law.",

      "An appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids",
      "LOS ANGELES -- An appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids.",
      "The decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The deployment was the first by a president of a state National Guard without the governor\u2019s permission since 1965.",
      "In its decision, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard.",
      "It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters.",
      "\u201cThe undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters \u2018pinned down\u2019 several federal officers and threw \u2018concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects\u2019 at the officers. Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van\u2019s windows,\" the court wrote. \"The federal government\u2019s interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.\u201d",
      "It also found that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California before federalizing the National Guard as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president\u2019s order.",
      "The California governor's office and the White House didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The court case could have wider implications on the president\u2019s power to deploy soldiers within the United States after Trump directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from other Democratic-run cities.",
      "Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops were necessary to restore order. Newsom, a Democrat, said the move inflamed tensions, usurped local authority and wasted resources. The protests have since appeared to be winding down.",
      "Two judges on the appeals panel were appointed by Trump during his first term. During oral arguments Tuesday, all three judges suggested that presidents have wide latitude under the federal law at issue and that courts should be reluctant to step in.",
      "The case started when Newsom sued to block Trump\u2019s command, and he won an early victory from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco.",
      "Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said only allows presidents can take control during times of \u201crebellion or danger of a rebellion.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration, though, argued that courts can\u2019t second guess the president\u2019s decisions and quickly secured a temporary halt from the appeals court.",

      "President Donald Trump honored Juneteenth in each of his first four years as president, before it became a federal holiday",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump honored Juneteenth in each of his first four years as president, even before it became a federal holiday. He even claimed once to have made it \u201cvery famous.\u201d",
      "But on this year's Juneteenth holiday on Thursday, the usually talkative president kept silent about a day important to Black Americans for marking the end of slavery in the country he leads again.",
      "No words about it from his lips, on paper or through his social media site.",
      "Asked whether Trump would commemorate Juneteenth in any way, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not tracking his signature on a proclamation today. I know this is a federal holiday. I want to thank all of you for showing up to work. We are certainly here. We\u2019re working 24/7 right now.\u201d",
      "Asked in a follow-up question whether Trump might recognize the occasion another way or on another day, Leavitt said, \u201cI just answered that question for you.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Black community leaders from across the country, senior Trump administration officials and other individuals met at the White House to discuss improving coordination between the leaders and federal, state and local partners, according to a senior White House official. Housing Secretary Scott Turner and Lynne Patton, director of minority outreach, were among those who attended, said the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a private gathering.",
      "The Republican president's silence was a sharp contrast from his prior acknowledgement of the holiday. Juneteenth celebrates the end of slavery in the United States by commemorating June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas. Their freedom came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln liberated slaves in the Confederacy by signing the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.",
      "Trump's quiet on the issue also deviated from White House guidance that Trump planned to sign a Juneteenth proclamation. Leavitt didn't explain the change. Trump held no public events Thursday, but he shared statements about Iran, the TikTok app and Fed chairman Jerome Powell on his social media site.",
      "In the evening, Trump complained on the site about \u201ctoo many non-working holidays\" and said it is \u201ccosting our Country $BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to keep all of these businesses closed.\u201d But most retailers are open on Juneteenth while most federal workers get a day off because the government is closed.",
      "He had more to say about Juneteenth in yearly statements in his first term.",
      "In 2017, Trump invoked the \u201csoulful festivities and emotional rejoicing\u201d that swept through the Galveston crowd when a major general delivered the news that all enslaved people were free.",
      "He told the Galveston story in each of the next three years. \u201cTogether, we honor the unbreakable spirit and countless contributions of generations of African Americans to the story of American greatness,\u201d he added in his 2018 statement.",
      "In 2019: \u201cAcross our country, the contributions of African Americans continue to enrich every facet of American life.\u201d In 2020: \u201cJune reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation. It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our Nation\u2019s unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.\u201d",
      "In 2020, after suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump chose Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the place to resume his public gatherings and scheduled a rally for June 19. But the decision met with such fierce criticism that Trump postponed the event by a day.",
      "Black leaders had said it was offensive for Trump to choose June 19 and Tulsa for a campaign event, given the significance of Juneteenth and Tulsa being the place where, in 1921, a white mob looted and burned that city's Greenwood district, an economically thriving area referred to as Black Wall Street. As many as 300 Black Tulsans were killed, and thousands were temporarily held in internment camps overseen by the National Guard.",
      "In an interview with The Wall Street Journal days before the rally, Trump tried to put a positive spin on the situation by claiming that he had made Juneteenth \u201cfamous.\u201d He said he changed the rally date out of respect for two African American friends and supporters.",
      "\u201cI did something good. I made it famous. I made Juneteenth very famous,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually an important event, it\u2019s an important time. But nobody had heard of it. Very few people have heard of it.\u201d",
      "Generations of Black Americans celebrated Juneteenth long before it became a federal holiday in 2021 with the stroke of President Joe Biden\u2019s pen.",
      "Later in 2020, Trump sought to woo Black voters with a series of campaign promises, including establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday.",
      "He lost the election, and that made it possible for Biden, a Democrat, to sign the legislation establishing Juneteenth as the newest federal holiday. Shortly after being sworn in for his second term in January, Trump signed an executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government, calling them \u201cillegal and immoral discrimination programs.\u201d",
      "Biden issued annual Juneteenth proclamations during his four years in office, and observed some of the holidays with large concerts on the South Lawn. Biden's final observance in 2024 featured performances by Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle. Vice President Kamala Harris danced onstage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.",
      "Biden was spending this year\u2019s holiday in Galveston, Texas, where he was set to speak at a historic African Methodist Episcopal church.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah investigators sought help from the public as they worked to unravel who was at fault when a safety volunteer at a weekend \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally fired at an alleged gunman and inadvertently hit and killed a protester.",
      "The safety volunteer, who has not been identified publicly, fired three rounds at Arturo Gamboa, 24, who had allegedly brandished a rifle at Saturday's crowd in downtown Salt Lake City. The gunshots hit both Gamboa and protester Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, according to the Salt Lake City police.",
      "Gamboa, who did not fire his rifle, was arrested on suspicion of murder, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death, police said. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "A state judge on Thursday granted a request by prosecutors to extend Gamboa's detention without bail until 5 p.m. on Monday, while investigators continue interviewing witnesses and reviewing footage of the incident, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said.",
      "Investigators are also looking into whether the safety volunteer was justified in firing his gun, according to police. Police on Wednesday asked the public for more video footage of events surrounding the shooting.",
      "It is unclear what Gamboa intended to do with the rifle. His father Albert Gamboa, reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday, declared his son's innocence in a brief phone call: \u201cMy son, Arturo Gamboa, is an innocent guy. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",
      "Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street.",
      "\u201cInevitably there are going to be instances like this one, which may or may not have been a misunderstanding,\u201d said Timothy Zick, a William & Mary Law School professor who has written about the laws surrounding public protests.",
      "\"It\u2019s hard to sort out who\u2019s acting lawfully with a firearm in the middle of an already crowded, sometimes chaotic protest space,\u201d he said.",
      "The protest of some 18,000 people was otherwise peaceful.",
      "Here\u2019s what is known so far about the shooting:",
      "Thousands of protesters were marching through downtown Salt Lake City when, around 8 p.m., the safety volunteer and another man said they spotted Gamboa, who was wearing all black clothing, move behind a wall and withdraw a rifle from a backpack, according to a police news release.",
      "The two men drew their handguns and ordered Gamboa to drop the rifle, but witnesses said he instead moved toward the crowd and held his rifle in a \u201cfiring position,\u201d according to police.",
      "The safety volunteer shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo. Ah Loo died after being taken to a hospital. Gamboa's wound was relatively minor, and he was arrested nearby by police, who found a rifle, gas mask and backpack in the area.",
      "Police said they do not yet know why Gamboa had the rifle or allegedly disobeyed the orders from the two men.",
      "The protest was one of hundreds nationwide Saturday against President Donald Trump\u2019s military parade in Washington, which marked the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump\u2019s birthday.",
      "The Utah chapter of 50501 Movement, which helped organize the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest, said in a statement Monday that the man who confronted Gamboa was a military veteran and \u201csafety volunteer\u201d meant to help maintain order.",
      "\u201cOur team of safety volunteers, who have been selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience, believed there was an imminent threat to the protestors and took action,\u201d organizers said.",
      "The group did not give further details on the person\u2019s training or explain why he was armed. Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for 50501 Movement, which helped organize the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests across the country, said all attendees, including those in safety roles, were asked not to bring weapons.",
      "It\u2019s extremely rare for safety teams, often called safety marshals, to be armed. Instead, they rely on calm demeanor, communication skills and relationships with police and protesters to help keep order, said Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor.",
      "\u201cArming marshals or peacekeepers is widely discouraged, as it tends to create more problems than it solves,\" Maguire said.",
      "Police said the permit for the protest did not specify that there would be armed security, and event staffers\u2019 roles were under investigation.",
      "Ah Loo was a successful fashion designer and former \u201cProject Runway\u201d contestant who devoted his life to celebrating artists from the Pacific Islands.",
      "Benjamin Powell, a friend of Ah Loo's, said the 39-year-old was born in Samoa but lived in Utah for about a decade.",
      "Ah Loo, a self-taught designer known to many as Afa, devoted his life to doing \u201cgood things for his neighbors and community,\u201d state Rep. Verona Mauga, a close friend, told the AP. Their families were both from the small village of Lotopa in Samoa, she said.",

      "As the international body closes in on 80 years, questions about its relevancy and efficiency have sharpened from supporters and critics alike. Recent U.S. cuts to foreign assistance and the reevaluation of humanitarian contributions by other countries have forced a reckoning for the U.N.",

      "Here are five things the U.N. does that you may not have known:",

      "In Chad, the U.N. Population Fund operates several rehabilitation programs for women and girls recovering from that trauma. One of them, Halima Yakoy Adam, was taken at age 15 to a Boko Haram training camp in Nigeria, where she and several other girls were forced to become suicide bombers. Adam managed to escape with severe injuries, while the others died in blasts.",
      "Through U.N. programs on the islands of Lake Chad, Adam received health and reproductive services as well as vocational training. She is now working as a paralegal in her community to assist other women and girls.",
      "\u201cWe are not created to stay,\u201d Keita said of U.N. agencies' long-term presence. \u201cSo this is embedded in what we do every single day. We have that humility in knowing that we make a difference, so that people do not need us the next day.\u201d",
      "Images of refugees at U.S. and European borders show the migration crisis around the world. Often overlooked are the refugees who are resettled in communities outside American and European cities, ones that resemble their home countries and cultural upbringings.",
      "Since 2016, the U.N.'s refugee agency has supported the integration of more than 50,000 refugees and asylum-seekers in Mexico. They arrived in southern Mexico and were relocated to industrial cities after being screened and granted asylum by the government.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees provides transportation, orientation and access to health, education and other social services. More than 650 companies have agreed to train and employ these people, whose labor has generated a $15 million annual contribution to the Mexican economy, according to the U.N.",
      "According to U.N. estimates, 94% of these working-age refugees have secured formal employment within their first month in the country and nearly 90% of school-age children have enrolled in school. The U.N. program also provides what staffers describe as clear pathways to Mexican citizenship.",
      "\u201cMexico has become a country where people forced to flee can find the stability they need to restart their lives with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lepri, the top U.N. refugee agency official in Mexico, said in March. \u201cA strong asylum system and legal framework allows an effective integration of asylum-seekers and refugees.\u201d",
      "U.N. agencies are present throughout various phases of war, from delivering food, water and medical supplies in an active military zone to the iconic \u201cBlue Helmets\u201d \u2014 the military personnel deployed to help countries transition out of conflict.",
      "Less attention is paid to efforts made after the dust has settled.",
      "One of those initiatives, the United Nations Mine Action Service, was established in 1997 to facilitate projects aimed at mitigating the threat posed by unexploded munitions in countries years \u2014 and sometimes decades \u2014 after war.",
      "The U.N. estimates that on average, one person is killed or injured by land mines and other explosive ordnance every hour.",
      "In January, a 21-year-old man was harvesting olives in a Syrian orchard with two friends when they noticed a visible mine on the ground. Panicked, they tried to leave, but one of them stepped on a land mine and it exploded, amputating one of his legs above the knee.",
      "A month later, in Cambodia, a rocket-propelled grenade believed to be more than 25 years old killed two toddlers when it blew up near their homes.",
      "The U.N. program aims to work with communities in Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria to safely locate and remove these remnants of war while providing education and threat assessments.",
      "Since its inception, the U.N. says more than 55 million land mines have been destroyed and over 30 countries have become mine-free.",
      "In a refugee camp in northwest Kenya, dozens of girls 12 to 18 have gathered every Saturday at a women's empowerment center to learn self-defense through a Taekwondo class.",
      "The program, launched by the U.N.'s Population Fund last year, has focused on providing an outlet for girls who have either been victims of gender-based violence or are at risk of it after fleeing conflict zones in countries like South Sudan, Ethiopia and Congo.",
      "The coaches are locals who understand the cultural and political dynamics their students face while living in a camp that is home to nearly 300,000 refugees.",
      "The goal is to use sports activities to create safe spaces for women and girls to discuss various issues like period poverty, abuse and domestic conflict. The program, which the U.N. has replicated in Egypt and elsewhere, is funded by the Olympic Refuge Foundation.",
      "Topics surrounding sex and reproductive issues were considered taboo for centuries in Buddhist communities. U.N. staffers have spent the past decade working with religious leaders in Bhutan and other countries in Asia to \u201cdesensitize\u201d the topics they believe are crucial to a healthy society.",

      "Now, at least 50 monks are trained to provide counseling services on these topics to students across Bhutan's 20 districts.",
      "The U.N. says these partnerships, which began in 2014, have contributed to a decrease in maternal mortality, an increase in contraception use, and better reproductive care for pregnant women.",

(AP) \u2014 Juneteenth celebrations unfolded across the U.S. on Thursday, marking the day in 1865 when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Texas and attracting participants who said current events strengthened their resolve to be heard.",
      "The holiday has been celebrated by Black Americans for generations, but became more widely observed after being designated a federal holiday in 2021 by former President Joe Biden, who was expected to attend an event in Galveston, the holiday's birthplace.",
      "The celebrations come as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has worked to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government and remove content about Black American history from federal websites. Trump\u2019s travel ban on visitors from select countries has also led to bitter national debate.",
      "In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Robert Reid waved a large Juneteeth flag at the city's African Burying Ground Memorial Park, where African drummers and dancers led the crowd in song and dance. Reid, 60, said he attended in part to stand against what he called Trump's \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach.",

      "Jordyn Sorapuru, 18, visiting New Hampshire from California, called the large turnout a \u201cbeautiful thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's nice to be celebrated every once in a while, especially in the political climate right now,\" she said. \u201cWith the offensive things going on right now, with brown people in the country and a lot of people being put at risk for just existing, having celebrations like this is really important.\u201d",
      "The holiday to mark the end of slavery in the U.S. goes back to an order issued on June 19, 1865, as Union troops arrived in Galveston at the end of the Civil War. General Order No. 3 declared that all enslaved people in the state were free and had \u201cabsolute equality.\u201d",
      "Juneteenth is recognized at least as an observance in every state, and nearly 30 states and Washington, D.C., have designated it as a permanent paid or legal holiday through legislation or executive action.",
      "In Virginia, a ceremonial groundbreaking was held for rebuilding the First Baptist Church of Williamsburg, one of the nation\u2019s oldest Black churches.",
      "In Fort Worth, Texas, about 2,500 people participated in Opal Lee\u2019s annual Juneteenth walk. The 98-year-old Lee, known as the \u201cgrandmother of Juneteenth\u201d for the years she spent advocating to make the day a federal holiday, was recently hospitalized and didn\u2019t participate in public this year. But her granddaughter, Dione Sims, said Lee was \u201cin good spirits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one thing that she would tell the community and the nation at large is to hold on to your freedoms,\u201d Sims said. \u201cHold on to your freedom and don\u2019t let it go, because it\u2019s under attack right now.\u201d",

The newly announced pardons weren\u2019t included in that initial announcement because they\u2019d been incorrectly coded.",
      "In New Hampshire, Thursday's gathering capped nearly two weeks of events organized by the Black History Trail of New Hampshire aimed at both celebrating Juneteenth and highlighting contradictions in the familiar narratives about the nation\u2019s founding fathers ahead of next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "\u201cIn a time when efforts to suppress Black history are on the rise, and by extension, to suppress American history, we stand firm in the truth,\" said JerriAnne Boggis, the Heritage Trail\u2019s executive director. \"This is not just Black history, it is all of our history.\u201d",

      "A groundbreaking is scheduled in Virginia for the rebuilding of one of the nation\u2019s oldest Black churches",
      "WILLIAMSBURG, Va. -- A ceremonial groundbreaking will be held Thursday for the rebuilding of one of the nation's oldest Black churches, whose congregants first gathered outdoors in secret before constructing a wooden meetinghouse in Virginia.",
      "The First Baptist Church of Williamsburg officially established itself in 1776, although parishioners met before then in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating. Free and enslaved members erected the original church house around 1805, laying the foundation with recycled bricks.",
      "Reconstructing the 16-foot by 32-foot (5-meter by 10-meter) building will help demonstrate that \u201cBlack history is American history,\u201d First Baptist Pastor Reginald F. Davis told The Associated Press before the Juneteenth groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cOral history is one thing but to have an image to go along with the oral history makes a greater impact on the psyche of oppressed people,\" said Davis, who leads the current 215-member congregation in a 20th Century church that is less than a mile from the original site. \"Black Americans have been part of this nation\u2019s history before and since the Declaration of Independence.\u201d",
      "The original building was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. First Baptist\u2019s second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century. But the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, a living history museum, bought the property in 1956 and turned the space into a parking lot.",
      "Colonial Williamsburg had covered the costs of building First Baptist's current church house. But for decades it failed to tell the church's pioneering history and the stories of other colonial Black Americans.",
      "In recent years, the museum has placed a growing emphasis on telling a more complete story about the nation's founding. Colonial Williamsburg's rebuilding of the church is an opportunity to tell Black history and resurrect the stories of those who originally built it.",
      "Rebuilding First Baptist's original meetinghouse will fill an important historical gap, while bolstering the museum's depiction of Virginia\u2019s 18th century capital through interpreters and restored buildings. More than half of the 2,000 people who lived in Williamsburg at the time were Black, many of them enslaved.",
      "Rev. James Ingram is an interpreter who has for 27 years portrayed Gowan Pamphlet, First Baptists\u2019 pastor when the original church structure was built. Pamphlet was an enslaved tavern worker who followed his calling to preach, sermonizing equality, despite the laws that prohibited large gatherings of African Americans out of fear of slave uprisings.",
      "\u201cHe is a precursor to someone like Frederick Douglass, who would be the precursor to someone like Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cGowan Pamphlet was leading the charge.\u201d",
      "The museum's archaeologists uncovered the original church's foundation in 2021, prompting Pastor Davis to say then that it was \u201ca rediscovery of the humanity of a people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis helps to erase the historical and social amnesia that has afflicted this country for so many years,\u201d he said.",
      "The archaeologists also located 62 graves, while experts examined three sets of remains and linked them to the congregation.",
      "Scientists at William & Mary\u2019s Institute for Historical Biology said the teeth of a Black male in his teens indicated some kind of stress, such as malnutrition or disease.",
      "\u201cIt either represents the conditions of an enslaved childhood or far less likely \u2014 but possibly \u2014 conditions for a free African American in childhood,\u201d Michael Blakey, the institute\u2019s director, said in 2023.",
      "In the early 1800s, the congregation acquired the property for the original church from a local white merchant. The land was low, soft and often soggy \u2014 hardly ideal for building, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg\u2019s executive director of archaeology.",
      "But the church's congregants, many of whom were skilled tradespeople, made it work by flipping bricks on their side and making other adjustments to lay a level foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was a marvel that they were able to build a structure there, but also that the structure persists and even grows bigger,\u201d Gary said, adding that the church was later expanded.",
      "Based on their excavation, archaeologists surmise there was no heat source, such as a fireplace, no glass in the windows and no plaster finish, Gary said.",
      "About 50 people could have sat comfortably inside, possibly 100 if they were standing. The congregation numbered about 500, which included people on surrounding plantations. Services likely occurred outside the church as well.",
      "White planters and business owners were often aware of the large gatherings, which technically were banned, while there's documentary evidence of some people getting caught, Gary said.",
      "Following Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831, which killed more than 50 white people in Virginia's Southampton County, the congregation was led by white pastors, though it was Black preachers doing the work, Gary said. The tornado destroyed the structure a few years later.",
      "The museum is rebuilding the 1805 meetinghouse at its original site and will use common wood species from the time: pine, poplar and oak, said Matthew Webster, the museum's executive director of architectural preservation and research. The boards are already being cut. Construction is expected to finish next year.",
      "The windows will have shutters but no glass, Webster said, while a concrete beam will support the new church directly over its original foundation, preserving the bricks.",
      "\u201cWhen we build the earliest part of the church, we will put bricks on their sides and will lay them in that strange way because that tells the story of those individuals struggling to quickly get their church up,\u201d Webster said. \u201cAnd then when we build the addition, it will be this formal foundation that really shows the establishment of the church.\u201d",
      "Janice Canaday, who traces her lineage to First Baptist, said Williamsburg's Black community never forgot its original location or that its graves were paved over in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThey will never be able to expunge us from the landscape,\u201d said Canaday, who is also the museum's African American community engagement manager. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you take out the building. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ban books. You will never be able to pull that root up because that root is so deep.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors said Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV, leaving him to die in a blizzard, and charged her with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene of a deadly collision.",
      "Her lawyers successfully defended her, painting a sinister picture of police misconduct and theorizing that O'Keefe was in fact killed by colleagues, followed by a vast cover-up. She was convicted of drunken driving, however, for which she will face a year's probation.",
      "Though her criminal case is over, Read still faces civil litigation. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against her and two bars where the couple drank that night.",

      "Defense lawyers asserted from the beginning that there was no collision between O'Keefe and the 6,000-pound (2,700-kilogram) SUV driven by Read, arguing instead that a crew of tightly knit local and state cops were shielding one of their own and framing her.",
      "Lead investigator Michael Proctor, who was fired from the Massachusetts State Police after the first trial for misconduct, knew some people at the party at the house outside of which O'Keefe was found.",
      "Proctor sent text messages to friends, family and co-workers calling Read a \u201cwhack job\u201d while implying that she was the lone suspect and he wanted her to pay. \u201cThere will be some serious charges brought on the girl ... Zero chance she skates. She\u2019s f\u2019d,\u201d he texted just hours into the investigation.",
      "A federal agent who was at the party, Brian Higgins, acknowledged at trial destroying his phone and SIM card afterward and disposing of them in two different locations on a military base.",
      "In another exchange, Jackson questioned a former officer who originally reported seeing Higgins and the Canton police chief near the SUV in a station garage, a statement she later recanted.",
      "\u201cHave you ever heard of something called the blue wall of silence?\u201d Jackson asked the officer. In closing arguments, he suggested that she changed her story under pressure from the department.",
      "The prosecution's evidence included pieces of Read's broken taillight that were recovered at the scene; accounts of the couple's crumbling relationship, fueled by booze; and several witnesses testifying that they heard her repeatedly say, \u201cI hit him.\u201d",
      "But defense lawyers portrayed the case as riddled with errors, missteps and malfeasance.",
      "They emphasized that the taillight fragments were not found immediately and argued that police had time to take them from Read\u2019s impounded vehicle and plant them. They also presented video evidence that Read\u2019s taillight could have been damaged instead when she hit O\u2019Keefe\u2019s car at home later that morning.",
      "The shards, which the state claimed cut into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm, had no blood, tissue or DNA on them. The only DNA found was on an intact piece of taillight on Read\u2019s SUV, and it contained three possible sources \u2014 O\u2019Keefe and two unknown males. A hair traced to O'Keefe was found on the rear of the SUV, but the defense questioned how it could have stayed there through the blizzard.",
      "Prosecutors also struggled to demonstrate that O'Keefe's injuries were consistent with being struck by a vehicle. They acknowledged not knowing how he was hit, and an accident reconstruction video they produced was panned by the defense since no one knows where he would have been standing.",
      "Meanwhile crash reconstruction experts testified for the defense that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with being hit by a large vehicle. Instead, the defense argued, O'Keefe was beaten up at the party.",
      "Neither side produced witnesses who saw him enter into the house, but the defense was able to show a fight was possible. A medical expert testified that wounds on his arm were consistent with an animal bite, supporting the theory that a family dog at the home attacked O'Keefe.",
      "A cut over his right eye and injuries to the back of his head, they said, more likely came from being punched and falling backward on a hard surface. It was hard to know, defense attorneys argued, since police never searched the home or treated anyone there as a suspect.",
      "Even Read's comments about having \u201chit him\u201d were explained away by the defense, which said prosecutors were trying to twist into a confession the dazed words of someone who was grieving and in shock.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a confession. It was confusion,\u201d Jackson said, noting that it is common to be in such a state after an emotional trauma.",
      "Any number of people at the home, defense lawyers suggested, while questioning why multiple key law enforcement witnesses were never considered potential suspects or investigated.",
      "The defense did not prove that someone else killed O'Keefe, but it was apparently able to create enough reasonable doubt for jurors.",
      "Higgins, the federal agent, had sent sexually charged and flirtatious text messages to Read despite knowing she was in a relationship with O\u2019Keefe. On the night in question, Higgins texted her while they were at a bar \u2014 \u201cUmm, well?\u201d he wrote. Moments later he was seen \u201cplay fighting\u201d with Brian Albert, a retired Boston police detective and the owner of the home where the party took place.",
      "They defense also pointed to a group text that morning in which one person suggested they all agree that O'Keefe never entered the home and Albert said, \u201cexactly.\u201d Albert, the defense said, never bothered to exit the house after O'Keefe was found. He later sold it, got rid of the family dog and ditched his cellphone.",
      "They also portrayed the family as politically connected, noting that Albert's brother was a police officer and a second brother was on the town's governing body.",
      "The defense also questioned Jennifer McCabe, Albert\u2019s sister-in-law, who was with Read when they discovered the body, about a misspelled web search: \u201chos long to die in cold.\u201d The defense argued that McCabe made it just before 2:30 a.m., but prosecutors said it was after O\u2019Keefe was found at Read's request.",
      "McCabe was also asked why she never went in the house after finding the body, suggesting that she already knew they were safe inside. No one from the home came outside as police and paramedics gathered.",

In 2016, he met DEA agent John Costanzo, who was supervising agents investigating Colombian businessman Alex Saab, a suspected bag man for Venezuela\u2019s Maduro. In 2023, Hern\u00e1ndez testified against Costanzo and another former DEA agent convicted of taking bribes from narco defense attorneys.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez turned the tables on the DEA around the same time he was charged alongside University of Miami professor Bruce Bagley for helping move $3 million on behalf of Saab, who prosecutors said was secretly negotiating a deal to betray Maduro.",

      "Investigators say a truck carrying a mother and three young children was mistaken for another vehicle in the shooting as vehicles were leaving the stadium. Gunfire killed 11-year-old Froylan Villegas and paralyzed cousin Tatiana Villegas, while Foylan\u2019s mother and baby brother were unharmed.",

      "A team of 60 international scientists report that by early 2028 society will have emitted enough greenhouse gases that the Earth will be pretty much locked into hitting the internationally agreed upon preferred limit for global warming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas in less than three years that a key threshold for limiting global warming will be nearly unavoidable, according to a study to be released Thursday.",
      "The report predicts that society will have emitted enough carbon dioxide by early 2028 that crossing an important long-term temperature boundary will be more likely than not. The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times. That level of gas accumulation, which comes from the burning of fuels like gasoline, oil and coal, is sooner than the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last year.",
      "\u201cThings aren\u2019t just getting worse. They\u2019re getting worse faster,\u201d said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re actively moving in the wrong direction in a critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious climate goals. Some reports, there\u2019s a silver lining. I don\u2019t think there really is one in this one.\u201d",
      "That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris agreement, has been a cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change. Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations. Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases in global temperatures.",
      "In Thursday's Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers calculated that society can spew only 143 billion more tons (130 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide before the 1.5 limit becomes technically inevitable. The world is producing 46 billion tons (42 billion metric tons) a year, so that inevitability should hit around February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this year, the scientists wrote. The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius (2.23 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times, the report said.",
      "The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has increased to nearly half a degree (0.27 degrees Celsius) per decade, Hausfather said. And the imbalance between the heat Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a key climate change signal, is accelerating, the report said.",
      "\u201cIt's quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where if you look across the indicators, we find that records are really being broken everywhere,\u201d said lead author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds in England. \u201cI can't conceive of a situation where we can really avoid passing 1.5 degrees of very long-term temperature change.\u201d",
      "The increase in emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main driver. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes in clouds also factor in. That all shows up in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, which is now 25% higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.",
      "Earth\u2019s energy imbalance \u201cis the most important measure of the amount of heat being trapped in the system,\u201d Hausfather said.",
      "Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. \u201cIt is very clearly accelerating. It\u2019s worrisome,\u201d he said.",
      "The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year. The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years. Still, the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few years even if individual years haven't consistently hit that mark, because of how the Earth's carbon cycle works.",
      "That 1.5 is \u201ca clear limit, a political limit for which countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change would be unacceptable to their societies,\u201d said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.",
      "The mark is so important because once it is crossed, many small island nations could eventually disappear because of sea level rise, and scientific evidence shows that the impacts become particularly extreme beyond that level, especially hurting poor and vulnerable populations, he said. He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.",
      "Crossing the threshold \"means increasingly more frequent and severe climate extremes of the type we are now seeing all too often in the U.S. and around the world \u2014 unprecedented heat waves, extreme hot drought, extreme rainfall events, and bigger storms,\u201d said University of Michigan environment school dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist who wasn't part of the study, said the 1.5 goal was aspirational and not realistic, so people shouldn\u2019t focus on that particular threshold.",
      "\u201cMissing it does not mean the end of the world,\u201d Dessler said in an email, though he agreed that \u201ceach tenth of a degree of warming will bring increasingly worse impacts.\u201d",

      "A former Fulton County jail guard has been indicted on federal civil rights charges",
      "ATLANTA -- A former Fulton County jail guard has been indicted on federal civil rights charges after prosecutors said she used her Taser abusively against three inmates and then lied to cover it up.",
      "Khadijah Solomon, a 47-year-old Fairburn resident, pleaded not guilty to the six-count indictment in federal court in Atlanta on Tuesday and was released on bail. The troubled jail where Solomon worked has been under a federal civil rights investigation for the past two years and was also the site where Donald Trump surrendered on election interference charges in 2023.",
      "Solomon's lawyer, Devin Rafus, said his client will fight the allegations.",
      "\u201cThe Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office is under a lot of political pressure with the Department of Justice investigating the jail,\u201d Rafus said via email. \u201cMy client is collateral damage of that pressure.\u201d",
      "The June 11 indictment said Solomon used her Taser \u201cwithout legal justification\" against separate inmates at the Atlanta jail on Jan. 16, Jan. 25 and Jan. 27. The indictment alleges that Solomon then wrote reports falsely justifying what she did.",
      "In reality, sheriff's office investigators said body-worn camera video showed the pretrial detainees were compliant and not resisting.",
      "In the Jan. 16 incident, sheriff's office investigators said Solomon approached an inmate who was kicking his cell door and said she was about to \u201cpop\u201d him before opening the cell and using the Taser on the inmate. Investigators said Solomon then stunned the inmate twice more. She later claimed in her report that the inmate \u201cwas getting ready to throw\u201d a tray at her.",
      "The sheriff's office in February announced that it had fired Solomon and two other jail officers \u2014 Chantrece Buggs and LaQuondria Pierce \u2014 arrested them, and charged them with state crimes including aggravated assault and violating their oath of office. Solomon, a jail sergeant, was also charged with cruelty to inmates and false statements or writings.",
      "At the time, investigators said Pierce used her Taser without justification on an inmate Feb. 13 and Buggs encouraged Solomon's violence. No federal charges against the other two were announced, and neither has yet been indicted in a state court.",
      "Rafus, who is also the lawyer representing Pierce, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on her state charges.",
      "Natalie Ammons, a spokesperson for Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat, said the sheriff's office had worked with the FBI in the Solomon case.",
      "\u201cOn three occasions, Khadijah Solomon allegedly tased Fulton County Jail detainees without a legitimate purpose, causing each of them pain and injury,\" U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg said in a statement. \"Abuses of power of this kind are unconstitutional, erode our community\u2019s trust, and will be prosecuted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Justice Department in July 2023 opened a civil rights investigation into jail conditions in Fulton County, citing violence, filthy living quarters and the in-custody death of a man whose body was found covered in insects. That investigation found that jail officers didn't receive adequate training and guidance on the use of force and were found to engage in \u201ca pattern or practice of using excessive force\u201d against people in county custody.",
      "The Justice Department and Fulton County officials announced in January that they had entered into a court-enforceable consent decree. An independent monitor was appointed in February to oversee that agreement.",

      "Environmental groups and Michigan\u2019s attorney general have filed separate challenges against a federal order that is keeping a coal-fired power plant open this summer",
      "DETROIT -- Environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general filed separate challenges Wednesday against a federal order that is keeping a coal-fired power plant open this summer.",
      "The environmental coalition said there's no energy emergency that would justify keeping Consumers Energy\u2019s J.H. Campbell plant alive in Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan.",
      "The U.S. Energy Department \u201chas no authority to compel Consumers to rehabilitate \u2014 and effectively reconstruct \u2014 the increasingly unreliable plant, nor to override the state\u2019s and utility\u2019s decision to replace the plant with less expensive and cleaner sources,\u201d the 54-page petition says.",
      "Consumers Energy had planned to close the power station by May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But the Energy Department intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until late August, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.",
      "The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, known as MISO, manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada. MISO has said there should be enough electricity this summer though it cited the potential for \u201celevated risk\u201d during extreme weather.",
      "\u201cThis type of order is fairly unprecedented,\u201d said lawyer Shannon Fisk of Earthjustice. \u201cIt's a fabricated emergency.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from the Energy Department. Consumers Energy said it is complying with the federal order.",
      "\u201cThe first coal delivery arrived at the plant before the original May 31 decommissioning date,\u201d spokesperson Brian Wheeler said.",
      "It's unclear whether the challenges by Attorney General Dana Nessel and environmental groups would be settled by the end of August when the order expires. Fisk said the order could be extended. A lawsuit also could be pursued.",
      "In Pennsylvania, an oil-and-gas plant was also ordered to keep its turbines running as a hedge against electricity shortages in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid. The Eddystone plant is just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River.",

      "A new United Nations report says that Iran carried out executions at \u201can alarming rate\u201d last year with at least 975 people killed",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Iran carried out executions at \u201can alarming rate\u201d last year with at least 975 people killed, the United Nations chief said in a report that also cited other human rights abuses, from barriers to freedom of expression to the use of torture and arbitrary detention.",
      "U.N. deputy human rights commissioner Nada Al-Nashif, who presented the report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on Wednesday, urged Iran to halt all executions as a first step toward a ban.",
      "She also called for urgent diplomatic negotiations to end the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The 975 people executed in 2024 surpassed the estimated 834 in 2023 and was the highest rate of executions since 2015, said the report by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Four of the executions were carried out publicly. Iran carries out executions by hanging.",
      "Of those executed, 52% were for drug-related offenses, 43% for murder, 2% for sexual offenses and 3% for security-related offenses, the report said.",
      "The number of women executed also increased. According to information received by the U.N. human rights office, at least 31 women were reported to have been executed in 2024, up from at least 22 in 2023. Among those 31 women were 19 reportedly executed for murder, including nine convicted of killing their husbands in cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child marriage.",
      "Also among those executed were women and men connected to protests that began in September 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who was arrested by Iran\u2019s morality police and accused of not wearing her head covering correctly.",
      "The report also said a disproportionate number of those executed were from Iran's minorities, with at least 108 Baluch prisoners and 84 Kurdish prisoners among those executed last year.",
      "Citing information received by the human rights office, the report said at least 31 people, including political dissidents, were executed for national security-related offenses such as spying for Israel.",
      "The rights office said it also received reports of torture, arbitrary detention and trials that failed to comply with due process and fair trial standards.",
      "As for the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, the report said information received by the rights office found that at least 125 journalists were prosecuted for their work in 2024. At least 40 female journalists were prosecuted or summoned for their reporting, the report said.",
      "Al-Nashif said Iran has cooperated with the human rights office, but Guterres regrets that the government has denied access to the independent international fact-finding mission on Iran that the Human Rights Council established.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida's public universities can free up $22.5 million a year to compensate student-athletes under an emergency rule approved by a state board Wednesday ahead of a landmark legal settlement allowing schools to pay their players through licensing deals.",
      "The sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust settlement, going into effect July 1, allows schools to directly pay their pay their players for the use of their name, image and likeness. It's upending the way college sports have been run for more than a century and has sent universities across the country scrambling for new revenue streams in the hopes of gaining an edge \u2014 or at least keeping pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college athletics.",
      "Public universities in Florida, which is home to some of the country\u2019s most high-profile college sports teams, will now be able to dip into the funding reserves of campus auxiliary programs like bookstores, food service, student housing and parking in order to cut checks to student-athletes. Under the policy approved Wednesday, the funds can be issued as a transfer or a loan.",
      "\u201cAthletic departments are already currently recruiting student-athletes for fall 2025, and they need clarity on the available funding to retain and recruit the best talent for their rosters,\u201d said Alan Levine, vice chair of the board of governors, which oversees Florida's state universities. \u201cIf the universities cannot react to the settlement immediately, there will be irreparable harm to the athletic programs and to the financial welfare of our institutions.\"",
      "Florida's emergency rule goes into effect immediately and will last 90 days, at which point the board of governors can reassess the issue.",
      "Other schools are also taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct payments to athletes.",
      "Meanwhile, Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments. And Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

      "R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after prison staff gave him \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him\" and was later forcibly removed from a hospital against medical advice, his lawyer alleged in a statement to CBS News and a federal court filing.",
      "The disgraced singer's lawyer, Beau Brindley, is requesting that a judge move him to home detention from the North Carolina prison where he is serving his sentences.",
      "\"Mr. Kelly's life is in danger and the threat comes from Bureau of Prisons officers whose duty is to protect him,\" Brindley wrote in a court motion filed Monday.",
      "He alleges the federal Bureau of Prisons is \"seeking to kill\" Kelly \"to cover up crimes committed in the investigation of his case.\"",
      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News show Kelly's legal team discuss the emergency release request with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien in back-and-forth filings this week. \"Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will,\" Julien said in a response filed Monday. \"Undeterred, Kelly now asks this Court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy.\"",
      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

      "A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the \"Friends\" star's overdose death will plead guilty, according to an agreement filed in court Monday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Perry, 54, was found unresponsive and floating face-down in his jacuzzi on\u00a0Oct. 28, 2023, according to\u00a0an autopsy report\u00a0from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours.

      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",
      "Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts capped a trial Monday for multiple lawsuits that were filed against the Trump administration: one by a coalition of public health groups and another by several Democratic state attorneys general.",

      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",
      "Another federal judge in Massachusetts earlier this year blocked the NIH from implementing a policy change that would have cut funding for research overhead costs, which is now being appealed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Today's court ruling halted the cancellation of millions of dollars that have already been awarded to address important public health needs and will allow funding for life-saving medical research to continue,\" the Massachusetts attorney general's office said Monday in a statement.",
      "They said that the judge had \"denounced these actions\" at the trial, saying he had \"never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable\" and would \"be blind not to call it out.\"",

      "Flaws cited by a trial brief brought by the groups included the lack of a definition for what qualified as banned \"DEI studies\" and NIH Acting Director Dr. Matthew Memoli having spent only minutes deciding which grants and funding opportunities to cut.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",

    "summary": "Social Security is dipping into its trust fund to pay current retirees, with spending outpacing its revenue from payroll taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a cut of between 19% to 23% to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",
      "\"Medicare provides essential coverage for millions of American seniors, but this year's report underscores the urgent need for serious, sustained reform to secure its long-term future,\" CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-airlines-us-the-points-guy/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "summary": "Tariffs are making building materials, including lumber and steel and aluminum, more expensive. Here are some tips for saving.",
    "story": [
      "Tariffs are pushing up the cost of materials that are frequently used in home renovation projects, leading some homeowners to reconsider fixing up their residences.",
      "Suppliers of materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum, have already hiked prices for builders. Sixty percent of homebuilders say suppliers have either already raised prices or intend to, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo's April 2025 Housing Market Index. They attribute the price hikes to the Trump administration's sweeping levies on the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "Extra costs for materials can add up quickly, leading to a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project, according to the NAHB.",
      "Pre-ordering materials, before prices rise, is one way to save on roofing supplies such as shingles, according to Connecticut-based builder David Perotti, founder of Fine Home Contracting. He told CBS News that he saved a \"few thousand dollars\" on behalf of a client by ordering the roofing shingles early.",
      "Most materials that are used to build homes in the U.S. are imported, Perotti explained. For example, one-quarter of the country's available lumber supply comes from Canada, and could be subject to a 15% levy.",
      "Steel and aluminum are integral to building roofs, homes' plumbing systems, electrical equipment and HVAC systems.",
      "Tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum took effect earlier this month\u00a0and can apply to everything from coil roofing nails to metal flashing used to prevent leaks.",
      "Perotti's advice to homeowners looking for a refresh is to press pause on purchasing new appliances, and opt for a fresh paint job, which can go a long way toward making a home look new again.",
      "\"If you were to do one project, painting is usually really nice to freshen things up,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Perotti is also urging his clients to budget up to an additional 30% for extra, tariff-related costs on materials, particularly those that can go into remodeling bathrooms.",
      "Another tip is to work with materials suppliers to lock in prices when possible, even before materials become available. As far as repairs go, Perotti's advice is to prioritize fixing exterior damage, which can quickly lead to a home's degradation and cause more problems.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will maintain the benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, marking a continuation of its \"wait-and-see\" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.",
      "The central bank also expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, but it still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as it projected in March.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference to discuss the rate decision.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The rate has remained at that level since President Trump took office in January. The last time the Fed cut rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "When determining rate cuts, the Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and maintain a healthy job market. In its announcement\u00a0Wednesday, the central bank mentioned solid labor market conditions and an economy that continues to grow at a \"solid pace\" although it also signaled caution.",
      "\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,\" the Fed wrote in its announcement.",
      "At the Wednesday press conference, Powell underscored the relative strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions including the 4.2% unemployment rate, a low inflation rate and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. But he added that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth in the economy this year.",
      "In its latest\u00a0quarterly projections\u00a0for the economy and interest rates, the Fed said it expects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will pick up to 3% by year end. The central bank also expects unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%, up from the current 4.2%.",
      "\"The thing that every outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4% in May, still above the Fed's target rate of 2%. There has been speculation that Mr. Trump's tariffs could drive up inflation, but so far it has largely remained in check.",
      "Powell said that he expect the Fed will learn a \"great deal more\" on tariffs over the summer and that the developments will inform their thinking moving forward. In the meantime, the Fed Chair said the central bank is well positioned to hold off on rate cuts. \"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" he said.",
      "More tariff changes are expected in the coming months. President Trump's 90-day-pause on reciprocal tariffs ends July 9.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "Fed officials said they predict two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, in keeping with what they projected in March, but did not specify when future cuts might happen.",
      "\"What we're waiting for to reduce rates is to understand what will happen with the tariff inflation,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Others, meanwhile, are betting a rate reduction will come in September. Economists give a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate at its September 17 meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "But analysts also remain cautious in their predictions. \"If the June and July inflation measures remain tepid \u2014 and especially if the labor market starts to show signs of weakness \u2014 that could have investors wondering if the Fed may consider a cut at its July 29-30 meeting,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What does this mean for your money?",
      "The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher benchmark rate can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers because it helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "When the benchmark rate is lowered, loan rates tend to follow, making it less expensive to borrow money.",
      "With the Fed keeping rates steady, it's unlikely that borrowers will see near-term relief on their lending costs.",
      "\"This is music to the ears of savers, like retirees, that are earning good income on their hard-earned savings,\" said Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email. \"But it underscores the urgency for borrowers to aggressively pay down high-cost credit card debt and offers little hope of a significant drop in interest rates any time soon.\"",
      "What has President Trump said about interest rates?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to slash rates, including on Wednesday morning before the Fed announced its decision. During remarks to the press, Mr. Trump called out Powell, saying he's \"done a poor job.\"",
      "\"We had the highest inflation we ever had and then it came down when I got elected,\" he said. \"Now we have a man who refuses to lower the Fed rate.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

      "U.S. residents accounted for more than half of all new millionaires created across the globe in 2024. The surge in American millionaires was bolstered by robust stock market returns, with the S&P 500 jumping more than 23% last year.",
      "\"Wealth growth was tilted strongly towards North America, driven by a stable U.S. dollar and upbeat financial markets,\" UBS analysts wrote in the report.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve Board will announce its next rate decision today, June 18, at 2 p.m. EST.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve Bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, maintaining the same cautious posture it has assumed throughout the first half of 2025.",
      "That's according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which as of June 18, 2025, shows a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. CME Group is the parent company of the Chicago Board of Trade and other exchanges.",
      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "When is the FOMC meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",

Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",

We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments. And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\" The union's current contract agreement expires in September 2026.",
      "The deal announced Wednesday requires that U.S. Steel maintain capacity to produce and supply steel from U.S. production locations to meet market demand in the country, and says that Nippon Steel will not \"prevent, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with U.S. Steel's ability to pursue trade action under U.S. law.\"",
      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",
      "The deal comes as Mr. Trump recently doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports.",
      "\"This is a momentous day for our country, our communities, and the American steel industry,\" said U.S. Steel CEO Dave Burritt in a news release announcing the partnership details. \"Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American workers secured the best possible deal.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous\u00a0Purdue bankruptcy settlement\u00a0was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",

      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students \u2014 part of a long-running battle between the president and the Ivy League school.",
      "The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database that keeps track of student visa applications. The Boston-based judge had previously blocked the policy through a temporary restraining order.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security told Harvard in May it was revoking its student visa system certification, telling the school \"it is a privilege to enroll foreign students\" \u2014 and the school \"lost this privilege\" by allegedly failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard quickly sued, arguing the school was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda.",
      "President Trump issued a separate order earlier this month barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard. Burroughs blocked that move two weeks ago.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and Harvard for comment.",
      "The battle over international students could have grave consequences for Harvard, where about one in four students hail from outside the United States. Mr. Trump suggested last month that Harvard should cap its foreign student enrollment at 15%, and share more information with the government so it can determine whether prospective students are \"troublemakers.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also ordered \"additional vetting\" for anybody who wants to travel to Harvard from abroad, including students as well as staff, faculty, guest speakers and tourists, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "It's part of a wider back-and-forth between Harvard and the Trump administration. In April, the administration pushed the school to make a range of policy changes in order to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the government, including external audits of some academic departments and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. When the school refused, the government said it would cut off billions of dollars in grants to Harvard.",
      "Other universities have faced similar pressure, including demands for policy changes \u2014 often zeroing in on the schools' handling of pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 and grant freezes.",

      "During a hearing before U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil's attorneys asked him to free Khalil from detention or transfer him to New Jersey. Farbiarz agreed, determining that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been \"highly unusual.\"",

In his written order, Farbiarz said that \"the Petitioner shall be released from immigration custody today.\" His bail conditions restrict his travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana, where he must attend all of his immigration proceedings.",
      "Khalil is a green card holder who was detained by immigration agents in March and is currently being held in Louisiana. His wife Noor Abdalla was 8 months pregnant with their first child when he was first taken into custody, and gave birth\u00a0to a baby boy in April. Immigration officials denied Khalil's request for temporary release to attend the birth.",
      "\"My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that,\" Abdalla said in a March interview with \u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "In a statement released by the ACLU, which represents Khalil, Abdalla said \"we can finally breathe a sigh of relief and know that Mahmoud is on his way home to me and Deen, who never should have been separated from his father.\"",

      "\"[T]here is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey \u2014 who lacks jurisdiction \u2014 to order Khalil's release from a detention facility in Louisiana,\" Jackson said. \"We expect to be vindicated on appeal, and look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the order was \"yet another example of how out of control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property,\" McLaughlin said. \"An immigration judge has already vindicated this position. We expect a higher court to do the same.\"",
      "Khalil was initially detained under a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Farbiarz ruled last week that Khalil cannot be detained simply based on that determination, but the Department of Homeland Security has kept Khalil detained based on allegations that he omitted details from his green card application. Farbiarz said the new justification wasn't enough to continue his detention.",
      "\"It's overwhelmingly unlikely that a lawful permanent resident would be held on the remaining charge here,\" Farbiarz said, adding that \"there is an effort to use the immigration charge here to punish the petitioner\" for his anti-Israel speech. As a graduate student at Columbia, Khalil was among the leaders of students who protested Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. Khalil has since graduated.",
      "\"What all of that evidence adds up to is a lack of violence, a lack of property destruction, a lack of anything that would be characterized as inciting violence,\" Farbiarz added, saying that he has given government attorneys ample opportunity to address the lack of evidence and that they have provided none.",
      "During the hearing, Khalil's attorneys said that a Louisiana immigration judge denied a bond hearing for Khalil and has denied asylum, in addition to finding him removable on Rubio's declaration, conflicting with Farbiarz's order last week.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:16:43 -0400",
    "summary": "There's a narrow window to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end before President Trump decides whether to involve the U.S. in the Israeli offensive.",
    "story": [
      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",
      "U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that there are confidential conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, and the potential environmental and health fallout for regional allies from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",
      "In the meantime, the president still has the option of choosing to use military force including the potential of using for the first time in history the MOP or massive ordnance penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb, to destroy the underground nuclear facilities at Fordo.",
      "In theory, Mr. Trump maintains the ability to launch a strike while he's out of town at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday and Saturday, sources said. A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003. But Iran has accumulated a quantity of enriched nuclear fuel that could potentially be matched with an advanced missile or a more rudimentary weapon in short order if the supreme leader ordered it. It remains an open question whether bombing Fordo would trigger Iran's leaders to sprint toward creating a bomb or end the program altogether.",

      "The policy, McConnell wrote, \"is arbitrary and capricious in its scope and lacks specificity in how the States are to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for Congressionally appropriated transportation dollars \u2014 grant money that the States rely on to keep their residents safely and efficiently on the road, in the sky, and on the rails.\"",
      "The Rhode Island judge added that \"Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically appropriated for transportation purposes.\"",
      "In a statement, Duffy called the ruling \"judicial activism pure & simple\" and said he will \"continue to fight in the courts.\"",
      "\"I directed states who want federal DOT money to comply with federal immigration laws. But, no surprise, an Obama-appointed judge has ruled that states can openly defy our federal immigration laws,\" Duffy said.",

But some jurisdictions say that if local police are forced to cooperate with ICE, immigrants may be less likely to trust police.",

      "Introduction",
      "I want to offer hope. The traditional tools of American democracy do still function. I wrote this book to tell the story of one consensus-building senator\u2014grounded in her home, aware of who she serves, and honoring the process\u2014who produced results and won elections. The chapters ahead explain how this happened. I began as president of my sons'\u00a0 elementary school PTA. That satisfying community leadership encouraged me toward state elected office before I found myself suddenly catapulted to the national stage and\u00a0 challenged by overwhelming responsibilities. My story took a major, positive turn in 2010, after I lost a primary election and voters themselves convinced me that my service was still important, and why. A diverse coalition of Alaskans returned me to the Senate in a write-in campaign, with a mandate to vote my conscience and keep their practical needs foremost, not my party. With their confidence, I became a newly self-directed and more successful senator.",
      "Alaskans' voices still guide me every day. Independent Alaskans became the largest part of my electoral coalition, and they supported me in thinking for myself, even if they sometimes disagreed with the result. I took that to heart, and followed my own judgment on votes, many times contrary to party leadership. For example, as the Senate process of confirming presidential appointments degenerated, with party-line votes for or against nominees based purely on politics, I chose to prioritize qualifications rather than party. In one of my toughest stands, I was the only Republican to oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. I got heat for these choices, but I believed I was helping the system work as the founders intended. At times, my independence also yielded political benefits, although that had not been my goal. Senators began working for my vote, knowing they couldn't take it for granted. The White House realized nominees had to be qualified to gain my support.",
      "The system works if we use it. We don't need an overhaul with drastic reforms (although I will touch on election changes in Alaska that empowered the center and could help elsewhere). The more discouraging message is that being a pro-institution problem solver is hard, and not many of us remain in the Senate. We have passed a lot of good laws, because our swing votes controlled the balance of power, but our team of roughly a dozen senators spread across both parties has been shrinking. Intense pressure weighed on bipartisan lawmakers such as Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, and Mitt Romney. The parties\u00a0 demand conformity, and their loudest voices are also their most extreme and uncompromising. As holdouts for bipartisanship, those of us building consensus brought abuse on ourselves. Now all three of these smart, honorable, productive colleagues have retired from the Senate.",
      "The solution is to keep electing people who want to solve problems. We can do this only one senator\u2014and one voter\u2014at a time. The partisanship and division in our country has come with a loss of community and a weakening in many of the local organizations that connect us. We no longer spend enough time talking to people with different points of view. I'm an example of someone who started out in public service, in our highly diverse neighborhood in Anchorage, learning about families unlike my own while we worked together to improve our children's lives. We build up American democracy from that community level. It is up to each of us to get involved.",
      "And that brings me to one more reason for this book: We need stories so we can see the possibilities. We need to be able to imagine ourselves in our leaders' roles. Washington, D.C., should be visible from Newtok and from every community in our country. This is why I've chosen to be open about my feelings and my failures as well as my successes. I have no exceptional talent. One reason I legislate with partners is that others have great ideas I would never think of. I know how to bring people together and get things done, but I'm no better than anyone else.",
      "My hope is that when you learn my story, my struggles, and my fears, you will realize that you can do this, too. We need you. Only good people can get our government back on track. We need regular people who care about their communities and are willing to do the work, follow the rules, and think for themselves. We have plenty of ideologues and party-oriented political warriors in Congress. We need more Little League coaches and soccer moms. If I can do it, so can you. In fact, it's your responsibility.",

      "A part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth \u2014 known as 988 option 3 \u2014 is being terminated under the Trump administration, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced.",
      "\"On July 17, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will no longer silo LGB+ youth services, also known as the 'Press 3 option,' to focus on serving\u00a0all\u00a0help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option,\" a statement\u00a0Tuesday from SAMHSA read.",
      "The agency said those who contact 988 will \"continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Friday, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said the \"Press 3 option,\" which is managed by a third party outside of the federal government, ran out of congressionally directed funding.",
      "\"Continued operation of Press 3 would have required SAMHSA to reallocate funds away from supporting the main 988 Lifeline thereby compromising the entire system,\" the statement said. \"SAMHSA made a critical decision that sustained the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\"",

The administration's decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible.\"",
      "The news comes in the middle of Pride Month, which Black called \"callous.\" He also criticized \"the administration's choice to remove the 'T' from the acronym 'LGBTQ+' in their announcement,\" saying, \"Transgender people can never, and will never, be erased.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has been briefed on both the risks and the benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "\"He believes there's not much choice,\" one source said. \"Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "The president approved attack plans on Iran on Tuesday night, but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country and formally join Israel's air campaign, a senior intelligence source and a Defense Department official told CBS News on Wednesday. Mr. Trump held off on deciding to strike in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, the sources said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will make a decision on whether to order a strike within the next two weeks.",
      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Mr. Trump was weighing a strike on Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. Israel has not conducted any known strikes on Fordo since it began bombing Iranian nuclear and military targets late last week.",
      "Trump's decision",
      "Mr. Trump is willing to get the U.S. involved if that's what it takes to knock out the site, sources said. As of Thursday, he was still reviewing his options and has not made a firm decision either way. He has discussed the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of the U.S. military infrastructure needed for a strike was in place or how much time it would take to move assets into position.",
      "One option Mr. Trump has considered is that Iran could disable Fordo on its own, if its leaders so choose, two of the sources said.",
      "David Lammy, the foreign secretary of the U.K., flew to Washington to meet Thursday with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, CBS News learned, with active diplomacy underway to find an off-ramp in the conflict and make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Iran. London maintains an embassy in Tehran, giving the U.K. visibility that the U.S. does not have in the Iranian capital.",
      "\"Now is the time to put a stop to the grave scenes in the Middle East and prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one,\" Lammy said in a statement following his meetings with Trump officials.",
      "Mr. Trump is aware of the diplomatic effort being undertaken, with Lammy, the foreign ministers of Germany, France and the high representative of the European Union set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva on Friday.",
      "The conversation there may help ascertain whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S., not just the European nations, which is something Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Mr. Trump has viewed intelligence reports indicating the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, has said in closed-door settings that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing nuclear weapons, according to multiple sources.",
      "Ratcliffe has said that claiming Iran isn't close would be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard line don't want to score a touchdown, one U.S. official said.",
      "Congressional committees that have been briefed by senior CIA analysts have been told the intelligence community's view remains that no order to weaponize has been given by the supreme leader and that Iran has not restarted research on a delivery mechanism for a nuclear bomb.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that \"so far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "\"They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\" he told reporters. \"If there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it's based upon fact and not political influence.\"",
      "\"Things change, especially with war\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not made a final decision on whether to strike Iran.",
      "\"I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, because things change, especially with war,\" he said.",
      "\"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,\" he said earlier in the day, adding that he'd like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program.",
      "Iran \u2014 which has long insisted the program exists solely for peaceful purposes \u2014 said Wednesday it \"does NOT negotiate under duress,\" and said it would \"respond to any threat with a counter-threat.\"",
      "Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a Pentagon official briefed on the matter.",
      "Israel began striking Iran last Friday morning. The Trump administration has said publicly it is not participating in the offensive strikes, though CBS News previously reported the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.",
      "In recent days, Mr. Trump has not ruled out the idea of joining Israel's campaign, saying on Truth Social his \"patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "The president said Tuesday the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. On Sunday, CBS News reported Mr. Trump had opposed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.",
      "Next steps in possible negotiations",
      "Two diplomatic sources indicated to CBS News that Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, had offered to host potential direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran should Tehran choose that path. At this point, there are no direct US-Iran talks scheduled, though European allies are trying to help coordinate.",
      "On Thursday, the Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rubio had told him that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts. A French diplomat said that Rubio spoke by phone with his French counterpart, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, and conveyed that the U.S. was ready for \"direct contact with the Iranians at any time.\" Barrot and Rubio are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations in order to coordinate.",
      "Amidst the chaos inside Iran following the Israeli strikes and the killing of top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials, it is not clear just what Araghchi's marching orders will be when he arrives in Geneva, nor how functional the Iranian government itself is at this moment.",
      "Sources in the region indicated that connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete. The cyber attacks that have paralyzed the banking system itself underscore the internal disruption, and as of Thursday multiple diplomats acknowledged it all made it more difficult to arrange for in person talks with Araghchi   in the first place. Iranian state news announced Araghchi   is expected to transit on to Turkey on June 20.",
      "One diplomatic source indicated that the ongoing Israeli assault may also make the supreme leader fearful to communicate given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him.",
      "Mr. Trump has been frustrated in recent weeks that while Iran shows up to the negotiating table, its leaders have not shown a willingness to negotiate terms. A U.S. official familiar with the efforts told News CBS that Iran sat for two weeks on the most recent Witkoff proposal presented by the U.S. without directly declining or accepting its terms. Instead Iranian leadership issued press statements, but the negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement left the Trump administration in doubt over whether Iran was engaging in good faith negotiations, or simply running out the proverbial clock.",
      "Netanyahu has publicly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump, and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes but also did not explicitly tell Netanyahu to go forward. Diplomatic sources acknowledged to CBS News that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel, and uncertain over whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was all a ruse to justify the military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "A U.S. official insisted to CBS News Thursday evening that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine as was his aversion to getting the U.S. military drawn into a Middle East war, especially without a clear sense of what will come next should the Iranian regime collapse. U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that behind closed doors there are conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, as well as environmental and health impacts for allies in surrounding areas that could result from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The unanimous order from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a victory for the president and allows for the continued deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they have been protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents during enforcement operations.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked a law known as Title 10 to call the Guard into federal service earlier this month in response to demonstrations against immigration raids conducted across Los Angeles. Since then, a total of roughly 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have deployed to Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the use of troops in California's largest city and sued the president over his decision to federalize the California Guard. A federal judge, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, concluded last week that Mr. Trump's actions were illegal and exceeded the scope of his authority.",
      "The judge blocked the administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed the president to return control of the troops to Newsom. His decision applied only to Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard, and not the Marines.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed the decision and won a temporary stay of Breyer's order from the 9th Circuit. It held a hearing Tuesday to consider a Justice Department request to halt the judge's decision while the case proceeds.",
      "The 9th Circuit judges sided with Mr. Trump on Thursday. They wrote \"it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority\" to federalize the National Guard under Title 10, which allows the president to call the Guard into federal service whenever \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,\" or when the president is unable to \"execute the laws\" of the U.S.",
      "The panel of judges \u2014 made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee \u2014 rejected the Trump administration's argument that the courts don't have the power to review whether the president is allowed to call up the Guard. But they said judges need to be \"highly deferential\" to the president if he decides that troops need to be deployed, citing prior rulings.",
      "The court said administration officials \"have presented facts to allow us to conclude that the President had a colorable basis for invoking\" Title 10, noting instances of protesters in Los Angeles interfering with immigration agents.",
      "The 9th Circuit also said the Trump administration did not need to seek Newsom's permission to call up the Guard. The state has pointed to a provision of Title 10 that said orders to federalize the Guard should go \"through the governors\" \u2014 but the court said that \"does not give governors any veto power.\"",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump wrote late Thursday: \"BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President's core power to call in the National Guard! The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.\"",
      "In his own statement, Newsom expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying: \"The court rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court. The President is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.\"",
      "Trump alleges \"rebellion\" \u2014 but California calls Guard deployment \"extraordinary\"",
      "The Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump properly invoked the authorities laid out in Title 10 when he federalized National Guard troops in response to the protests in Los Angeles. In his June 7 memorandum deploying members of the National Guard, Mr. Trump said the protests constituted a \"form of rebellion\" against the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department further argued that courts had no role to play in reviewing the president's directive, as the law leaves decisions of whether to call forth the National Guard to the president's discretion. Courts, administration lawyers said, should not second-guess the commander-in-chief's military judgments.",
      "During arguments before the 9th Circuit, Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, warned that Breyer's order, if left intact, risked putting federal judges \"on a collision course with the commander in chief\" and would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "But California officials argued that the Trump administration should have considered more \"modest measures\" to quell the demonstrations in Los Angeles before taking the \"extraordinary step\" of deploying the National Guard.",
      "Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for the state, warned that the continued presence of troops on California streets would only escalate tensions and the risk of violence. Plus, he said Mr. Trump failed to adhere to the requirements of Title 10 by not consulting with Newsom before calling forth members of the California National Guard.",
      "In his memo, Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of the Guard. The secretary then issued memoranda to the adjutant general of the California National Guard to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "It had been 60 years since a president last sent in the National Guard without a request from a state's government, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed the guard to Alabama in 1965 to protect a voting rights march.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his memo that the protests in Los Angeles threatened the security of a federal immigration detention facility in the city, as well as other government property. The demonstrations broke out earlier this month in response to the immigration raids across Los Angeles, conducted as part of Mr. Trump's promise of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. Protests against the president's immigration crackdown have spread to other cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has continued to step up immigration enforcement and announced Sunday on social media that federal immigration authorities should \"do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest mass deportation program in history.\"",

Biden called Galveston \"the city where freedom rang out 160 years ago.\"",
      "In 2021, Biden signed into law\u00a0a measure that made June 19, or Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Called the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the bill passed the House with overwhelming support and was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate. Juneteenth became the nation's first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.",

      "\"Still today, some say to me and you that this doesn't deserve to be a federal holiday. They don't want to remember...the moral stain of slavery,\" he said.",
      "Biden also chided what he referred to as \"ongoing efforts to erase history from our textbooks and our classrooms.\"",

      "As President Trump is contemplating potential U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, law enforcement officials have stepped up surveillance of Iran-backed operatives in the United States, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel has increased efforts to monitor possible domestic sleeper cells linked to Hezbollah \u2014 a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran \u2014 since Israel's Operation Rising Lion offensive began earlier this month, U.S. officials said.",
      "Both the White House and FBI declined to comment.",
      "The threat from Iranian operatives has worried current and former administration officials since Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was assassinated on Mr. Trump's orders in January 2020.",
      "Late last year, federal prosecutors\u00a0charged an operative\u00a0of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and two U.S.-based people with plotting to surveil and assassinate critics of the Iranian regime. The IRGC operative allegedly told investigators he was pushed by unnamed IRGC officials to plan an\u00a0attack\u00a0against Mr. Trump.",
      "For years, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have been concerned about Iran's ability to direct or inspire attacks within the United States \u2014 a concern that has ramped up since Soleimani's killing. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and others have devoted significant resources to countering the threat.",
      "There are a range of potential targets. In recent years, prosecutors have charged people with plotting to kill Mr. Trump's former national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton\u00a0and Iranian American journalist\u00a0Masih Alinejad, both of whom are frequent critics of Iran's government. Bolton was granted Secret Service protection in 2021, but Mr. Trump\u00a0revoked his protection\u00a0this year.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's strikes against Iran have killed a number of its top nuclear scientists and battered its nuclear facilities, but complete destruction of Iran's ability to make weapons-grade uranium is believed to be out of reach \u2014 unless the U.S. agrees to help.",
      "At least one key uranium enrichment site, Fordo, has so far been unscathed. Located 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by Russian-produced air defenses, Fordo is believed by military experts to be key to Iran's nuclear program. Nuclear non-proliferation experts say this is where Iran has tried to enrich uranium for weapons purposes and expand its stockpile of enriched uranium.",
      "Israel's best chance at destroying the facility at Fordo could lie with a U.S.-produced bomb that's so heavy that it can only be dropped by a U.S. plane. At a hearing Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire raised this with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"It's being reported that the president is being asked to consider providing the bunker-buster bomb that is required to be carried only by the B-2 Bomber and would require a U.S. pilot,\" she said, asking Hegseth whether he had been asked to provide President Trump with options for striking the Middle East. He declined to answer.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering joining Israel's offensive against Iran, and approved attack plans Tuesday, but has not made a final decision, CBS News has reported. The White House said Thursday that the president would make a decision on whether to order a strike within the next two weeks. Sources told CBS News that the president had discussed the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs as he weighs whether to wade into the conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb",
      "The bomb that Shaheen was referring to is the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, known as a MOP. It is designed to attack \"deeply-buried facilities and hardened bunkers and tunnels,\" according to the Air Force. It's guided by military GPS and is meant to reach and destroy targets in well-protected facilities.",
      "The MOP measures about 20.5 feet in length and 31.5 inches in diameter, according to the Air Force.",
      "It weighs in at just under 30,000 pounds, including about 5,300 pounds of explosive material. The Air Force says that the MOP's explosive power is over 10 times that of its predecessor, the BLU-109.",
      "It's designed to penetrate up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The warhead is encased in a special high-performance steel alloy, which is meant to enable it to carry a large explosive payload while maintaining the penetrator case's integrity during impact, according to an Air Force fact sheet.",
      "Boeing developed the GBU-57, and as of 2015, the aerospace company had been contracted to produce 20 of them, according to the Air Force.",
      "Because of the GBU-57's weight \u2014 it's the heaviest bomb produced by the U.S. \u2014 the B-2 Spirit is currently the only aircraft in the Air Force that is equipped to carry and deploy it.",
      "B-2 Spirit",
      "One of the key attributes of the B-2 Spirit is its stealth \u2014 it's able to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets. It's aerodynamically efficient and its internal weapons bays can carry two of the GBU-57 bombs.",
      "Because of what the Air Force refers to as the plane's \"low-observable technologies,\" the B-2 Spirit has a \"high level of freedom of action at high altitudes.\" It's built with a combination of \"reduced infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic, visual and radar signatures.\" This, along with composite materials, special coatings, wing design and other classified processes, make the B-2 difficult for even the most sophisticated defense systems to detect and track.",
      "Without refueling, its range is about 6,000 nautical miles.",
      "The B-2 took its first flight in 1989, in California, but now, Whiteman Air Force Base, in Missouri, is the only B-2 base. It's been used for airstrikes in the Kosovo War, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The prime contractor for the B-2 is Northrop Grumman.",
      "For years, some lawmakers and defense experts have suggested that the U.S. provide Israel with GBU-57 bombs and jets capable of carrying them \u2014 but the idea is controversial, with critics arguing the move would be provocative.",

    "summary": "Fighting for control of the Democratic Republic of Congo's mineral wealth has killed millions. Trump wants to end it, and potentially reap huge rewards.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014\u00a0At the invitation of Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshekedi, the Trump administration was brought in to lead negotiations to end the war raging in the east of the country between DRC forces and rebels believed to be backed by Rwanda. A peace deal was initialed Wednesday evening by officials from the neighboring nations, and it's set to be signed formally late next week in Washington by their leaders, and witnessed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the\u00a0State Department said.",
      "While many in the region will welcome an end to the long-running and deadly conflict, Daniel Van Dalen, a senior analyst at the Africa-focused intelligence firm Signal Risk, says the way the agreement was hashed out signals a major change in geopolitical efforts to end crises on the continent. The days of diplomatic soft power, he says, are over.",
      "Officials have said the agreement is part of the U.S.' new bid under President Trump to build relationships in Africa that are more transactional and less focused on exerting soft power through diplomacy and investment.",
      "The deal came after three days of talks in Washington between DRC and Rwandan delegations \u2014 and after many previous failed attempts to secure an agreement between the two countries.",
      "If implemented, the agreement will end the fighting in eastern DRC. It could also bring billions of dollars of American investment into the region, which is rich in the minerals coltan, cobalt, lithium, copper and gold, all of which are critical in the manufacture of electric vehicles, smartphones, computers and a wide range of other high-tech goods, from satellites to military weapons systems.",
      "The curse of Congo's mineral wealth",
      "The DRC is a country roughly the size of Alaska and Texas combined, but its vast mineral reserves sit largely in the far east, near the border with Rwanda. Many locals call it a curse, as fighting over control of the resources has led to three decades of fighting in the region,\u00a0killing some six million people, according to a 2022 analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "More than 125 different armed groups have fought over access to the mineral reserves, but the largest, the M23 militia, is the only one thought to be backed by a neighboring country \u2014 Rwanda. The U.S. government and the United Nations officials believe Rwanda backs M23 militarily, though Rwandan officials have repeatedly denied that.",
      "Van Dalen says M23 is different to the other armed groups in the region as it has sought territorial control and expansion. The group's estimated 5,000 foot soldiers have taken two provinces in the eastern DRC over the last few months. In short order, he said, M23 has set up parallel government structures, with tax systems, in those areas, and will be very difficult to remove.",
      "Critics of the U.S.-brokered peace deal are skeptical that it will work, as M23 is not a signatory to the agreement and has not been involved directly in the negotiations, and the Rwandan government denies formal links with the group.",
      "Van Dalen said the deal will only succeed if M23 abides by the terms. Rwanda walked from previous peace talks, while M23 surged into new territory in the DRC.",
      "\"That remains true today, as the M23 are still pushing, in spite of peace negotiations, for territorial gains,\" Van Dalen told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Since M23's seizure of the two provinces in DRC, Van Dalen said there's been a surge in Rwandan mineral exports \u2014 a surge representing more than the country could account for from its own, limited reserves.",
      "CBS News understands from sources in the region that Rwanda has indicated a willingness to withdraw its troops, who are believed to back M23 fighters in the region, while the DRC might be amenable to the idea of some minerals, mined locally and on a small scale from its territory, being sold through Rwanda.",
      "Trump administration looking for deals: \"High risk, with vast rewards\"",
      "Amid the peace negotiations in Washington, President Trump's daughter Tiffany's father-in-law, Massad Boulous,\u00a0was brought in as a senior adviser to the White House on Africa.",
      "He was quickly dispatched to the DRC, Rwanda and neighboring nations, to \"meet with Heads of State and business leaders to advance efforts for durable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and to promote U.S. private sector investment in the region.\"",
      "That work was focused, Van Dalen said, on brokering separate deals with the DRC, to grant access to its mineral reserves, and with\u00a0Rwanda, on a potential deportee program. A previous agreement between Britain and Rwanda, for the U.K. to deport migrants to the African nation,\u00a0fell apart before it even got underway\u00a0\u2014 as a result of British court decisions and then a change in government in the U.K.",
      "Striking deals like this can give the White House the ability to tout peace-making efforts while securing access to critical resources for the U.S., but it can also help counter China's dominance in Africa's mineral sector, Van Dalen said. It is a tactic China and Russia have\u00a0used for many years.",
      "Chinese companies currently\u00a0control over 80% of the cobalt reserves in DRC, according to U.S. government estimates.",
      "Secretary of State Rubio will witness the signing of the DRC-Rwanda deal in Washington on June 27, the State Department said in its Wednesday night statement, which provided only vague details.",
      "It said the parties had agreed to \"provisions on respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities; disengagement, disarmament, and conditional integration of non-state armed groups,\" as well as establishing \"a Joint Security Coordination Mechanism,\" facilitating the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, facilitating humanitarian access, \"and a regional economic integration framework.\"",
      "U.S. companies had mining operations in the region several decades ago, but they left when the armed conflict and corruption in regional governments made those operations too risky.",
      "DRC President Tshekedi has recently revisited legislation that could reform the country's tax code in ways that make its mining sector more appealing to Western business interests.",
      "Those proposed changes had already sparked new interest, with U.S. funding committed to develop the Lobito Corridor \u2014 a rail line to connect the DRC's land-locked \"copper belt\" with an Angolan Atlantic Ocean port.",
      "In November, then-President Joe Biden visited Angola and saw the Lobito Corridor port operations first-hand. The following month, the\u00a0Biden administration announced an additional $560 million in U.S. funding for the project.",
      "Van Dalen said if the U.S. is able to manage the regional tension and keep a peace agreement in place, it would be \"high risk, with vast rewards, both for the region and the U.S. itself,\" adding that, in his view, it would also fit right in with \"Trump's transactional nature.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

      "Rep. Eric Swalwell is no stranger to fighting legal battles. Swalwell, in his seventh term as a Democrat representing the Bay Area of California, served as an impeachment manager in President Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020. Swalwell is also the plaintiff in a four-year civil lawsuit seeking damages from Mr. Trump for the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But Swalwell, an attorney and former local prosecutor in Alameda County, is so concerned about legal peril during the second Trump term, he has taken out a liability insurance policy to protect himself. Swalwell confirmed he had done so in a text message to CBS News.",
      "In a social media post last month, Swalwell accused the Trump administration of targeting Democratic legislators like his colleague, New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting law enforcement officers at an immigration detention center.",
      "Swalwell \u2014 who has not been charged with a crime \u2014 wrote on X, \"A RED LINE has been crossed. Trump is prosecuting his political enemies in Congress. This is just the beginning. We must take whatever we've done before to show dissent and go one rung higher.\"",
      "Last week's handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a news conference and briefly cuffed by federal agents after publicly questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has raised criticisms that the Trump administration has broken norms \u2014 and escalated tensions \u2014 by allowing federal law enforcement to arrest or detain elected officials who dissent.",
      "The Padilla incident occurred weeks after the arrests of McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat, after a May 9 confrontation with federal agents outside the Delaney Hall immigration facility in Newark. Prosecutors dropped the case against Baraka, but McIver faces felony charges and the prospect of a multi-year prison sentence if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Prosecutors allege McIver struck agents with her arms during the incident. The Department of Homeland Security accused the elected officials of \"breaking into\" the detention center.",
      "McIver responded to her indictment in a statement that said, \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "In the latest incident, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democrat running for mayor, was detained by immigration agents Tuesday at a Manhattan courthouse.",
      "In a sequence of events captured on video, Lander was seen holding onto a man, whom he identified as Edgardo, following the man's immigration hearing. Video then showed masked immigration agents trying to take the man into custody, and then taking Lander into custody as he asked to see a warrant.",
      "Federal law enforcement officials said Lander was arrested \"for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\"",
      "He was released four hours later, with his wife and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul by his side. No charges were filed against him.",
      "The series of arrests began with the case of Hannah Dugan in April. Dugan, an elected Wisconsin circuit court judge, has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing federal agents, for allegedly rerouting a criminal defendant from her courtroom to avoid immigration agents. Dugan's July 21 trial date was delayed Wednesday, as a judge considers a motion from Dugan to dismiss the case.",
      "Raskin alleges \"strong-arm tactics\" to \"silence and intimidate\"",
      "The arrests, detentions and handcuffings are inflaming an already toxic political moment and supercharging complaints by Democrats that Mr. Trump is seeking to use law enforcement powers to subdue his opposition.",
      "\"Trump and his enforcers want to handcuff and jail members of the legislative branch who perform oversight,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Raskin told CBS News, \"These strong-arm tactics are meant to silence and intimidate people, but they only strengthen our conviction.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a White House spokeswoman said, \"Here's the real story: why do so many Democrat officials feel emboldened to brazenly break the law and then complain when they are held accountable?\"",
      "\"It's alarming Democrats think they can obstruct federal law enforcement, assault ICE agents, or physically push law enforcement officers while charging a cabinet secretary, without consequence \u2014 it's even more alarming that the media is encouraging and defending this lawless behavior,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "After his case was dismissed, Baraka filed a civil suit against the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, who not only filed the criminal case, but posted about Baraka's arrest on social media. The lawsuit accuses Habba of defamation and seeks damages for what it calls \"false arrest and malicious prosecution.\"",
      "The criminal cases are a burden to public officials, who must pay legal costs and expend time on court hearings. Defense attorneys for McIver noted she has juggled initial proceedings in her case in Newark with her duties in the U.S. Capitol, during a busy month in the House since the May 9 incident.",
      "In her filing to dismiss her obstruction case, Dugan argued the Justice Department was violating separation of powers and unlawfully exceeding its authority. \"The government's prosecution here reaches directly into a state courthouse, disrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge,\" she argued.",
      "The legal battles are separate from the political acrimony that has been fueled by the physical confrontations, including the handcuffing of Padilla last week \u2014 which the Department of Homeland Security claims happened after Padilla \"lunged toward\" Noem.",
      "In a tearful floor speech Tuesday, Padilla asked, \"How many Americans in the year 2025 see a vindictive president on a tour of retribution?\"",
      "As part of her statement to CBS News, the White House spokeswoman said, \"Democrats are disingenuously characterizing their behavior with the help of the Fake News media.

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers and the public gathered at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday night to honor Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, who were fatally shot over the weekend in what authorities called a political assassination.",
      "As a brass quintet from the Minnesota Orchestra played, Gov. Tim Walz wiped away tears and comforted attendees at the gathering for former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs.",
      "Walz has described Hortman as his closest political ally and \"the most consequential Speaker in state history.\"",
      "\"She stuck up for people's rights. She was a fighter,\" Marie Hagerty, from Oakdale, Minnesota, said. \"She had good friends in the representative office. She tried to reach across both sides of the aisle.\"",
      "Wednesday's vigil also included a Native American drum circle, a string quartet and the crowd singing \"Amazing Grace.\"",
      "The memorial, which sprang up outside the Capitol after the killings, features flowers, American flags, photos of Hortman and sticky notes with such messages as, \"Thank you for always believing in me and in Minnesota,\" and \"We got this from here. Thank you for everything.\"",
      "\"It still seems so surreal that this happened here,\" Louis Boutcher, from Oakdale, Minnesota, said. \"This is Minnesota. It shouldn't happen here. It shouldn't happen anywhere, but it's just different.\"",
      "Around the gathering, there was a heavy police presence, with law enforcement blocking off streets leading up to the Capitol and state troopers standing guard.",
      "The event did not have any scheduled speakers and attendees were instructed not to bring signs.",
      "The University of Minnesota held a midday memorial gathering on the Minneapolis campus.",
      "Rebecca Cunningham, the university's president, spoke during the event about the grief and outrage people are grappling with, along with questions about how things got to this point.",
      "\"I don't have the answers to these questions, but I know that finding answers starts with the coming together in community as we are today,\" she said.",
      "The Hortmans were shot and killed at their Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, home around 3:30 a.m. Saturday, officials said. The man accused of their killings, Vance Boelter, faces federal and state charges. He is also accused of shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who both survived, and allegedly visited at least two other lawmakers' homes.",
      "Hortman was in her 11th term in the Minnesota Legislature, having first been elected in 2004. She served as speaker emerita of the House, and Walz called her \"the most consequential Speaker in state history.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Melissa Hortman's mother, Lisa Haluptzok, said the pain of her daughter's death is \"mind-numbing.\"",
      "\"It's been very hard the last few days,\" her brother, Patrick Haluptzok, said. \"In what seems unfair and tragic, the way her last night was spent. We're just trying to get by.\"",
      "The Hortmans' children, Sophie and Colin, said they were \"devastated and heartbroken,\" but offered ways for the public to honor their memory, including planting a tree, petting a dog and standing up for what you believe in, \"especially if that thing is justice and peace.\"",
      "The Hortmans received a formal procession through the Twin Cities on Tuesday. Funeral details have not yet been announced.",

      "U.S. officials reviewing applications have been told to look for \"any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.\"",
      "A senior State Department official said that the new vetting guidelines are part of an effort to \"ensure we are properly screening every single person attempting to visit our country\" and to make the U.S. and its universities safer.",
      "The official said that consular posts could resume scheduling application interviews, which had been temporarily suspended as the State Department prepared stricter social media vetting.",
      "Late last month, the State Department said in a cable that it was planning to expand social media screening and vetting for international student visa applications. This followed an announcement in April that Citizenship and Immigration Services would be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "As a result, counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. had already begun advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of State Department officials."

    "summary": "Sen. Ted Cruz sparred with media personality Tucker Carlson, highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies over whether to join Israel's campaign against Iran.",
    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

    "summary": "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops against the Taliban was detained by ICE officers after he attended a mandatory immigration hearing in San Diego.",
    "story": [
      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last week in San Diego.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Sayed Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego after he attended a mandatory immigration hearing on Wednesday, June 11.",
      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-bag-bans-fees-curbs-litter-study-says/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",

      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",

    "story": [
      "The United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, and the number continues to grow, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to at least\u00a0750, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,200, with infections confirmed in at least 34 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

Biden called Galveston \"the city where freedom rang out 160 years ago.\"",
      "In 2021, Biden signed into law\u00a0a measure that made June 19, or Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Called the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the bill passed the House with overwhelming support and was approved by unanimous voice vote in the Senate. Juneteenth became the nation's first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.",

    "story": [
      "Tallahatchie County, Mississippi \u2014\u00a0There are 138 National Monuments across the U.S., but for the first time in nearly 100 years, they're eligible to be sold for parts.",
      "This Juneteenth, some of the protected lands in jeopardy commemorate important moments in American civil rights history, including some newer monuments like the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.",
      "\"We are seeing this effort to erase and reverse history and historic preservation,\" said historian Alan Spears, senior director of cultural resources and government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association. \"This is turning quickly into a dream deferred.\"",
      "Spears advocated for years, alongside several community members, to get federal protections for the areas in Mississippi and Chicago that tell the story of Emmett Till \u2014 a\u00a014-year-old Chicago boy\u00a0who was kidnapped in the middle of the night and\u00a0brutally lynched\u00a0in 1955 after reportedly whistling at a White woman while visiting family in Mississippi.",
      "\"His badly decomposed body was taken from the water, and officials in this area wanted to have him buried immediately to sort of get rid of the evidence,\" Spears explained. \"His mother insisted that he'd be sent back to Chicago, where they had an open casket funeral. And images of Till's badly decomposed body in that open casket really sparked the modern civil rights movement.\"",
      "Protections to preserve this history finally came in 2023, when a monument\u00a0consisting\u00a0of two sites in Mississippi and one in Illinois,\u00a0was designated\u00a0by former President Joe Biden.",
      "One site is located at Graball Landing along the Tallahatchie River near Glendora, Mississippi, where Till's body was found. The second is at the Tallahatchie County Courthouse in Sumner, Mississippi, where his confessed killers were found not guilty by an all-White jury. The third is located at Chicago's Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, where Till's funeral was held.",
      "Spears says he and his colleagues have been working to expand the monument, not remove or shrink it.",
      "\"Let's make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else's son ever again,\" Spears said.",
      "But just as the stroke of a president's pen preserved these areas, it could now take them away.",
      "A legal opinion released by the Justice Department earlier this month gives presidents the ability to revoke or shrink certain national monuments for the first time since the 1930s. The opinion comes as\u00a0part of a movement\u00a0against diversity, equity and inclusion, with some land reportedly under consideration to be used for mineral extractions.",
      "It's not just national monuments that are at risk. Under newly proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service of nearly $1 billion, Spears says more than 300 park sites would be forced to shut down. Those budget cuts could also potentially see the closure of the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, according to Spears and former National Park Service Director Chuck Sams.",
      "\"It's like amputating an arm for a hangnail. It's a complete overreaction,\" Spears says.",

      "Grisham, a Democrat,\u00a0responded\u00a0to the memo by declaring a state of emergency in April and authorizing the deployment of about 70 New Mexico National Guard members to the city. The National Guard spent May in training and arrived on Albuquerque's streets on June 5.",

      "During two homicide calls and a SWAT activation this week in Albuquerque, the job of the Guard members was to secure a perimeter. That freed up police officers who would have done that job to go back on the streets and respond to other calls, according to Albuquerque police.",
      "\"We need to stop playing games with crime,\" Det. Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, the department's union, told CBS News.",

      "\"What are they going to do?\" Willoughby asked. \"They can't intervene. They don't have the authority to take anybody to jail. They're not armed. They're going to be in one of the most violent communities in this country, in a polo shirt, recognizing themselves as this helper, and they're limited onto what they can do.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",
      "U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that there are confidential conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, and the potential environmental and health fallout for regional allies from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",
      "In the meantime, the president still has the option of choosing to use military force including the potential of using for the first time in history the MOP or massive ordnance penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb, to destroy the underground nuclear facilities at Fordo.",
      "In theory, Mr. Trump maintains the ability to launch a strike while he's out of town at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday and Saturday, sources said. A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003. But Iran has accumulated a quantity of enriched nuclear fuel that could potentially be matched with an advanced missile or a more rudimentary weapon in short order if the supreme leader ordered it. It remains an open question whether bombing Fordo would trigger Iran's leaders to sprint toward creating a bomb or end the program altogether.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:51:54 -0400",
    "summary": "British lawmakers have backed legislation that would legalize assisted dying for adults with six months or less to live.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0After hours of impassioned debate, British lawmakers in the House of Commons voted Friday to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives. The bill passed by 23 votes, with hundreds protesting about the divisive issue outside of parliament, from both sides of the debate.",
      "The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill will now undergo months of scrutiny by the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Britain's Parliament. The lords, who are not elected, can debate, delay and amend the bill, but they have little power to block legislation passed by the elected Members of Parliament in the House of Commons.",
      "The central tenet of the bill is that adults over 18 who are deemed to have less than six months to live could \u2014 after a series of safeguarding checks \u2014 be provided help to end their lives, in the form of fatal drugs that they could self-administer.",
      "In November, British lawmakers gave initial approval to the new law, passing it by 330 votes to 275 \u2014 a wider margin that indicates some members of parliament changed their minds before Friday's vote.",
      "Since the first vote, the original bill proposed by Labour Party lawmaker Kim Leadbeater underwent several changes, including the dropping of a provision that would have required a judge to sign off on any final decision granting a medically assisted death. The current bill requires any request to be approved by two doctors and a panel that includes a social worker, a senior legal figure, and a psychiatrist.",
      "In a debate before the vote on Friday, Leadbeater told parliament about the many stories she had heard from people who witnessed friends and family suffer traumatic deaths.",
      "\"Not supporting the bill today is not a neutral act. It is a vote for the status quo,\" she said, according to The Associated Press. \"And it fills me with despair to think MPs [Members of Parliament] could be here in another 10 years' time hearing the same stories.\"",
      "Leadbeater and other supporters of the bill argue that people with terminal diagnoses should have the right to choose whether to continue living. They have cited stories of people taking their own lives in secret because no-one could legally help them.",
      "They also argue that it isn't fair that people with enough money can currently seek life-ending care by traveling to Switzerland. More than 500 Britons have ended their lives in Switzerland, where foreigners can opt for an assisted death.",
      "Opponents argue that elderly or disabled people could be manipulated \u2014 overtly or covertly \u2014 into ending their lives, to save money or to relieve a perceived burden on loved ones. Others say better end-of-life and health care would be a better alternative.",
      "Outside parliament on Friday, protesters faced off with contrasting slogans. Some wore clothes bearing the phrase: \"Campaign for Dignity in Dying,\" while opponents held banners calling the U.K.'s state-run National Health Service, the \"National Suicide Service.\"",
      "The vote paves the way for what could be one of the biggest changes in social policy in the U.K. since the partial legalization of abortion in 1967.",
      "If the bill passes the House of Lords, it is expected to take another four years to be fully implemented.",

    "summary": "American cyclist Ian Andersen said Iranians' warm welcome and hospitality changed abruptly when Israel started bombing.",
    "story": [
      "Popping a champagne bottle on Portugal's Atlantic coast in February, 32-year-old American Ian Andersen\u00a0set out to fulfill his dream of biking across all seven continents of the world. He planned to ride for 10 months, covering roughly 10,000 miles to reach his final destination of Japan.",
      "He did not plan, however, for Israel to launch a war on Iran.",
      "As he crossed into Iran on June 1, Andersen was filled with excitement, and anxiety.",
      "\"I was quite nervous. I was like, okay, now we're getting into some uncharted territory here,\" he told CBS News on Thursday from a hotel room in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku. \"But I was immediately put at ease with so many positive experiences from people that I met on the road\u2026 and hospitality, generosity.\"",
      "He said he was \"surprised daily\" by kind, curious Iranians inviting him for tea or offering him food, even trying to pay for his meal at a restaurant.",
      "On June 13, that changed, when Israel started bombing Iran's nuclear and military sites.",
      "\"Not any outward hostility, but I just kind of read people's body language and their facial expressions,\" said Andersen. \"And I knew I was in quite a bit of danger, because people were seeing Israel and the U.S. as being quite tied together at that point, as the bombs kept falling and the missiles kept striking.\"",
      "He and his local Iranian guide, Reza, decided to hunker down at a guesthouse about 45 miles north of Tehran, in a village called Harijan, for two days.",
      "Reza, who Andersen said had become his friend, advised him to avoid telling people he was American, and to avoid talking to people at all if possible. But he said he slipped up, revealing his nationality to some local travelers who joined them at the hotel.",
      "\"They weren't happy about the fact that they were having to share a hotel with 'that American' that was there,\" said Andersen.",
      "On June 15, Andersen heard an Israeli bomb explode in the distance. That same day he received an email from the U.S. State Department, advising him of options for Americans wishing to leave Iran, based on their current locations. He decided his best bet was an eight hour drive north, around the Caspian Sea, to reach Azerbaijan.",
      "He and Reza were quickly caught up in a steady flow of dense traffic, as residents streamed out of Tehran. They passed gas stations with long lines of cars, and many military checkpoints.",
      "\"It was quite harrowing,\" he said. \"The idea of maybe being pulled over at one of the military checkpoints.\"",
      "\"Reza, my guide, had told me that he can no longer protect me, and that really rattled me, right? Cause, he's my guide. He's my Iranian guide, and very stable, sturdy, dependable guy. And he's like, 'All right, this is it. Like, you're in quite a bit of danger here. If we're stopped and the police suspect you of something, there's nothing I can do.'\"",
      "Andersen said he became \"more and more at ease as we got closer,\" and they eventually made it without incident to Iran's border with Azerbaijan.",
      "But the most nerve-wracking part of that final day was about to begin, as he was interviewed not once, but twice by Iranian officials \u2014 normal border police and then by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.",
      "For the second interview, he was pulled out of a crowd and taken into the backroom of a storage closet in a makeshift army barracks.",
      "\"That's where I was like, 'Okay, I've got a 50-50 chance of being taken either as a bargaining chip or for further questioning,'\" he said. \"Actually, the interview was like, less than a minute.\"",
      "\"I walked out back into the night to get my bicycle and then actually enter Azerbaijan, and I half expected them to call me back. I was like, 'Something's wrong here. Um, why, why was this so easy?' But they didn't, and I was able to enter Azerbaijan.\"",
      "Clear of Iran's internet firewall, he was able to message his family in the U.S. before he checked into the first hotel he could find, and then sleep for 12 hours in relief and exhaustion.",
      "Now safe as the Israel-Iran conflict drags on, Andersen said he thinks a lot about the possible spillover effect for anyone with a U.S. passport living and traveling overseas.",
      "He said he registered his travel itinerary with the U.S. State Department's STEP program, which sends country-specific notifications and updates based on a traveler's movements. It's how he knew to head for Azerbaijan, and he urges all Americans traveling abroad to do the same.",
      "Andersen also said if it were not for his Iranian guide, he might not have made it out of the country. He hopes to raise money for Reza and his family, who are still in Iran.",
      "He also intends to carry on with his bike ride to Japan, to fulfil his dream of cycling all of the world's continents.",

      "Erbil, Iraq\u00a0\u2014 Israel has been hammering Iran's nuclear and military sites for a week. To reach their targets, Israeli warplanes must cover about 1,000 miles, traversing as many as three countries, including Iraq, which sits right on Iran's western border. For decades, Iranian groups opposed to the Islamic Republic's theocratic rulers have organized in exile across the border in Iraq, including ethnic Kurdish factions that have become well organized, and armed.",
      "Kawsar Fattahi is a leader in one of the opposition parties that's been outlawed in Iran and labelled a terrorist organization by the authorities in Tehran.",
      "\"The regime is weakening day by day,\" she told CBS News. Fattahi believes the government led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could collapse under the pressure of the Israeli assault. If it does, she said it would be just deserts for the Islamic hardliners who have ruled the nation with an iron fist for almost half a century.",
      "\"Okay, the war is bad. People are dying. But it's still not that much killing [as] the Iranian regime itself do,\" she told CBS News, arguing that Iran's leaders have killed more Iranians themselves over the decades than the Israelis have with a week of blistering warfare. Iranian officials have only acknowledged about 220 deaths from Israel's strikes, but the Washington-based Human Rights Activists in Iran group, which relies on a network of sources in the country, says the death toll is really over 650, with more than 2,000 others wounded.",
      "Ayatollah Khamanei, the 86-year-old who's ruled the nation of 90 million people for nearly four decades, is only Iran's second supreme leader since the 1979 revolution that brought the conservative, deeply anti-American Islamic Republic to power. The revolution toppled a pro-Western, but deeply corrupt and repressive royal family which had led Iran to a secular and relatively prosperous nation in the region.",
      "Many older Iranians can still remember those pre-revolution days, and many younger Iranians, even with their censored view of the outside world, crave the freedoms that the regime has brutally stifled.",
      "The regime is deeply unpopular with many Iranians, and that has manifested in mass protests on several occasions over the last decade, including those calling for an end to forced Islamic dress codes and other restrictions on women. The demonstrations have been met with deadly force.",
      "Iranian opposition wants support, but not U.S. \"boots on the ground\"",
      "Seeking to tap the vein of simmering discontent inside Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appealed to Iranians to rise up against their own government again \u2014 saying now is the time, with the regime at its weakest thanks to his country's assault.",
      "\"Brave people of Iran, your light will defeat the darkness,\" he urged last week after launching the attacks.",
      "Due to the war, the \"Iranian regime have lost their control to suppress people, because a lot the leadership of IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] have been killed,\" she said. \"Now the power of suppression are weakening inside Iran, so it can lead people to come street again.\"",
      "But Fattahi told CBS News that Iranians do not want Israel, or the U.S., to engineer regime change in Tehran. She said that while American airstrikes might help further weaken the government, Iranians want to topple their leaders \u2014 and decide who replaces them \u2014 on their own.",
      "\"We do not want their boots on the ground, obviously,\" she said. \"We don't want [a] made-up state.\"",
      "What kind of support do Fattahi and her group want from the world's biggest military, then?",
      "\"Don't compromise with the regime, because they are killing people,\" she said. \"World would be a better place without the Iranian regime, for all of us.\"",
      "She said Iranians, with enough support from the international community, are ready and willing to build their own new government, and \"we want a democratic Iran. We want a secular Iran.\"",
      "She said her party was already having discussions with U.S. officials.",

      "Kurdish groups aren't the only Iranian exiles eager to see the back of the clerical regime, however, nor the only ones likely to be talking with officials in Washington about what comes next.",
      "Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last royal leader, the shah who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has also lived for years in exile, and he has also been an outspoken critic of the ayatollah. Pahlavi, who lives in the Washington D.C. area, has indicated in interviews this week that he wants to lead a political transition, and that he's been in discussions already about his country's future.",
      "\"Informed sources inside the country who have been in contact with me say that the regime's command and coordination structures are breaking down at a remarkable pace,\" Pahlavi said in a message posted on social media Friday. \"On the other hand, the international community is realizing that the Islamic Republic has no future and that our discussions about a post-Islamic Republic Iran have begun, which could accelerate and facilitate the regime's fall.\"",
      "It remains unclear how much support the son of the ousted shah, whose family is seen as being close to the U.S. and Israel \u2014 or the exiled Kurdish groups \u2014 might actually garner among Iranians. It's also unclear how many Iranians still in the country might feel confident enough to take to the streets again, or when that point could be reached, given how swiftly and violently previous popular uprisings have been put down.",
      "Any U.S. military involvement in the offensive against the regime could bring that point closer, but Khamenei has warned that such a move would be met with \"irreparable damage\" for the U.S.",

Now, Israel has superiority in Iranian airspace, which it has used to take out missile sites and drones. Iran's regional proxy groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, which have long posed a threat to U.S. bases in the region, have also been seriously depleted by months of Israeli strikes.",

      "\"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,\" he said earlier in the day, adding that he'd like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program.",
      "Iran \u2014 which has long insisted the program exists solely for peaceful purposes \u2014 said Wednesday it \"does NOT negotiate under duress,\" and said it would \"respond to any threat with a counter-threat.\"",

At this point, there are no direct US-Iran talks scheduled, though European allies are trying to help coordinate.",
      "On Thursday, the Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rubio had told him that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts. A French diplomat said that Rubio spoke by phone with his French counterpart, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, and conveyed that the U.S. was ready for \"direct contact with the Iranians at any time.\" Barrot and Rubio are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations in order to coordinate.",

      "Sources in the region indicated that connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete. The cyber attacks that have paralyzed the banking system itself underscore the internal disruption, and as of Thursday multiple diplomats acknowledged it all made it more difficult to arrange for in person talks with Araghchi   in the first place. Iranian state news announced Araghchi   is expected to transit on to Turkey on June 20.",
      "One diplomatic source indicated that the ongoing Israeli assault may also make the supreme leader fearful to communicate given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him.",
      "Mr. Trump has been frustrated in recent weeks that while Iran shows up to the negotiating table, its leaders have not shown a willingness to negotiate terms. A U.S. official familiar with the efforts told News CBS that Iran sat for two weeks on the most recent Witkoff proposal presented by the U.S. without directly declining or accepting its terms. Instead Iranian leadership issued press statements, but the negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement left the Trump administration in doubt over whether Iran was engaging in good faith negotiations, or simply running out the proverbial clock.",
      "Netanyahu has publicly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump, and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes but also did not explicitly tell Netanyahu to go forward. Diplomatic sources acknowledged to CBS News that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel, and uncertain over whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was all a ruse to justify the military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "A U.S. official insisted to CBS News Thursday evening that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine as was his aversion to getting the U.S. military drawn into a Middle East war, especially without a clear sense of what will come next should the Iranian regime collapse. U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that behind closed doors there are conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, as well as environmental and health impacts for allies in surrounding areas that could result from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",

      "Israel's Home Front Command said in a statement posted online that one of the missiles launched by Iran on Thursday was a \"dispersal munition,\" a missile designed to release about 20 smaller bombs at an altitude of roughly four miles as it nears a target, inflicting potential damage on the ground across a radius of about five miles. It said each of the small bombs released could cause damage similar to that of a short-range rocket.",

      "Israel vows to hold Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"accountable\"",

      "Haim Bublil, a local police commander, told reporters several people were lightly wounded in the strike on the hospital. He said there was a fire in a six-story building that was hard to access, and that rescuers were still searching various buildings and moving patients to safer areas of the hospital.",

      "Mr. Trump held off on deciding to strike in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, as he had demanded, the sources said. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the president will make a decision on whether to order a strike within the next two weeks.",
      "\"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt at the White House press briefing.",

The decisions of the U.S. are decisions of President Trump.\"",
      "A Washington-based Iranian human rights group said at least 639 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 1,300 wounded since Israel began its attacks.

      "Iranian state television said there was \"no radiation danger whatsoever\" at the Arak reactor. A reporter for the state TV, appearing live in the nearby town of Khondab, said the facility had been evacuated and there was no damage to civilian areas around the reactor.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, said the Arak facility \"was not operational and contained no nuclear material, so no radiological effects\" were anticipated from the strike.",
      "Israel had warned earlier Thursday morning it would attack the facility and urged the public to flee the area. The Israeli military said Thursday's round of airstrikes targeted Tehran and other areas of Iran, without elaborating.",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Already, Israel's campaign has targeted Iran's uranium enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran and a nuclear site in Isfahan.",
      "Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon.",
      "Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "In 2019, Iran started up the heavy water reactor's secondary circuit, which at the time didn't violate Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "Britain at the time was helping Iran redesign the Arak reactor to limit the amount of plutonium it produces, stepping in for the U.S., which had withdrawn from the project after President Trump's decision in 2018 to unilaterally pull America out of the nuclear deal.",
      "The IAEA has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. IAEA inspectors reportedly last visited Arak on May 14.",
      "Due to restrictions Iran imposed on inspectors, the IAEA has said it has lost \"continuity of knowledge\" about Iran's heavy water production -- meaning it couldn't absolutely verify Tehran's production and stockpile.",
      "As part of negotiations around the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to sell off its heavy water to the West to remain in compliance with the accord's terms. Even the U.S. purchased some 32 tons of heavy water for over $8 million in one deal. That was one issue that drew criticism from the pact's opponents.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Iran has long been suspected of hiding work toward a nuclear weapon at its underground Fordo enrichment site.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, the one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Both sit south of Tehran in central Iran, but Fordo has long been the Iranian nuclear facility of most concern to international monitors and experts.",
      "Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability. There have been no reported Israeli strikes on the Fordo enrichment facility.",
      "As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\"",
      "Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed that the country had intelligence indicating the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters early Tuesday morning, President Trump appeared to have been swayed. Asked about the assessment Gabbard delivered in March, he said: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Iran's leaders have always denied any interest in building a nuclear weapon, insisting the program is for civilian purposes. But if that's obfuscation, as Israel insists, and the Iranians are close to a nuclear weapons capability, more than a decade of analysis of Iran's nuclear facilities by experts around the world suggests Fordo would be central to those efforts.",
      "Mr. Trump has been briefed on both the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The White House said Thursday that he expects to make a decision within two weeks. \"Based on the fact that there is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement.",
      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "Because of its location deep within a mountain, experts believe Israel's best chance at destroying the facility could lie with a U.S.-produced \"bunker-buster\" bomb\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP \u2014 a bomb is so heavy that it could only be dropped by an American B-2 Bomber. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked about the possibility at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's being reported that the president is being asked to consider providing the bunker-buster bomb that is required to be carried only by the B-2 Bomber and would require a U.S. pilot,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat of New Hampshire, pressing Hegseth on whether he had been asked to provide the president with options for striking the Middle East. He declined to answer.",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

She had been dreaming of studying in Israel for years and, after much consideration, her parents decided to support their daughter's decision in April.",

      "President Trump said\u00a0Wednesday he had not yet decided whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran. Sources told CBS News Mr. Trump has\u00a0approved attack plans on the country, but a final decision to strike had yet to be made.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem told U.S. citizens in Israel Thursday morning that the State Department was \"planning for contingencies to assist with private U.S. citizens' departure from Israel.\"",
      "\"We will alert the U.S. citizen community if there is additional information to share regarding departure options,\" the embassy said in an email message to Americans who had enrolled in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).",
      "\"If the U.S. government provides departure assistance from Israel, options would most likely include travel to a nearby, safe country,\" and not travel all the way back to the U.S., the embassy said. It asked Americans in Israel interested in leaving the country to fill out an online form.",
      "After Israel's airspace closed, Birthright said in a statement to CBS News that the organization evacuated approximately 1,500 program participants on Tuesday aboard the Crown Iris, a luxury Israeli cruise ship operated by Mano Maritime, sailing from Ashdod Port to Larnaca, Cyprus. There are 2,800 program participants, the organization said, and the majority are young adults from the United States.",

      "Birthright aims to bring 50,000 Jewish young adults, a portion of whom attend the Onward program, to Israel every year.",
      "Cohen said her daughter's roommate exited through Jordan, taking a car to the capital of Amman and flying from there to the United States.

She, her husband, son and teen daughter have been waiting in southern Israel for evacuation.",
      "Her family enrolled in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) and was waiting to hear the next steps on evacuation plans from the U.S. government. She said she hadn't heard yet from the federal government but had been in touch with local legislators and nonprofits.",

      "Field, who visited Israel once before in 1990, said even with the uncertainty everyone is facing, she and her family felt fairly safe.",
      "\"We've met the most amazing, wonderful people and feel more connected than we ever have,\" Field said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-deal-democratic-republic-congo-rwanda-war-mineral-resources/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:01:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Fighting for control of the Democratic Republic of Congo's mineral wealth has killed millions. Trump wants to end it, and potentially reap huge rewards.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014\u00a0At the invitation of Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshekedi, the Trump administration was brought in to lead negotiations to end the war raging in the east of the country between DRC forces and rebels believed to be backed by Rwanda. A peace deal was initialed Wednesday evening by officials from the neighboring nations, and it's set to be signed formally late next week in Washington by their leaders, and witnessed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the\u00a0State Department said.",
      "While many in the region will welcome an end to the long-running and deadly conflict, Daniel Van Dalen, a senior analyst at the Africa-focused intelligence firm Signal Risk, says the way the agreement was hashed out signals a major change in geopolitical efforts to end crises on the continent. The days of diplomatic soft power, he says, are over.",
      "Officials have said the agreement is part of the U.S.' new bid under President Trump to build relationships in Africa that are more transactional and less focused on exerting soft power through diplomacy and investment.",
      "The deal came after three days of talks in Washington between DRC and Rwandan delegations \u2014 and after many previous failed attempts to secure an agreement between the two countries.",
      "If implemented, the agreement will end the fighting in eastern DRC. It could also bring billions of dollars of American investment into the region, which is rich in the minerals coltan, cobalt, lithium, copper and gold, all of which are critical in the manufacture of electric vehicles, smartphones, computers and a wide range of other high-tech goods, from satellites to military weapons systems.",
      "The curse of Congo's mineral wealth",
      "The DRC is a country roughly the size of Alaska and Texas combined, but its vast mineral reserves sit largely in the far east, near the border with Rwanda. Many locals call it a curse, as fighting over control of the resources has led to three decades of fighting in the region,\u00a0killing some six million people, according to a 2022 analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "More than 125 different armed groups have fought over access to the mineral reserves, but the largest, the M23 militia, is the only one thought to be backed by a neighboring country \u2014 Rwanda. The U.S. government and the United Nations officials believe Rwanda backs M23 militarily, though Rwandan officials have repeatedly denied that.",
      "Van Dalen says M23 is different to the other armed groups in the region as it has sought territorial control and expansion. The group's estimated 5,000 foot soldiers have taken two provinces in the eastern DRC over the last few months. In short order, he said, M23 has set up parallel government structures, with tax systems, in those areas, and will be very difficult to remove.",
      "Critics of the U.S.-brokered peace deal are skeptical that it will work, as M23 is not a signatory to the agreement and has not been involved directly in the negotiations, and the Rwandan government denies formal links with the group.",
      "Van Dalen said the deal will only succeed if M23 abides by the terms. Rwanda walked from previous peace talks, while M23 surged into new territory in the DRC.",
      "\"That remains true today, as the M23 are still pushing, in spite of peace negotiations, for territorial gains,\" Van Dalen told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Since M23's seizure of the two provinces in DRC, Van Dalen said there's been a surge in Rwandan mineral exports \u2014 a surge representing more than the country could account for from its own, limited reserves.",
      "CBS News understands from sources in the region that Rwanda has indicated a willingness to withdraw its troops, who are believed to back M23 fighters in the region, while the DRC might be amenable to the idea of some minerals, mined locally and on a small scale from its territory, being sold through Rwanda.",
      "Trump administration looking for deals: \"High risk, with vast rewards\"",
      "Amid the peace negotiations in Washington, President Trump's daughter Tiffany's father-in-law, Massad Boulous,\u00a0was brought in as a senior adviser to the White House on Africa.",
      "He was quickly dispatched to the DRC, Rwanda and neighboring nations, to \"meet with Heads of State and business leaders to advance efforts for durable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and to promote U.S. private sector investment in the region.\"",
      "That work was focused, Van Dalen said, on brokering separate deals with the DRC, to grant access to its mineral reserves, and with\u00a0Rwanda, on a potential deportee program. A previous agreement between Britain and Rwanda, for the U.K. to deport migrants to the African nation,\u00a0fell apart before it even got underway\u00a0\u2014 as a result of British court decisions and then a change in government in the U.K.",
      "Striking deals like this can give the White House the ability to tout peace-making efforts while securing access to critical resources for the U.S., but it can also help counter China's dominance in Africa's mineral sector, Van Dalen said. It is a tactic China and Russia have\u00a0used for many years.",
      "Chinese companies currently\u00a0control over 80% of the cobalt reserves in DRC, according to U.S. government estimates.",
      "Secretary of State Rubio will witness the signing of the DRC-Rwanda deal in Washington on June 27, the State Department said in its Wednesday night statement, which provided only vague details.",
      "It said the parties had agreed to \"provisions on respect for territorial integrity and a prohibition of hostilities; disengagement, disarmament, and conditional integration of non-state armed groups,\" as well as establishing \"a Joint Security Coordination Mechanism,\" facilitating the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, facilitating humanitarian access, \"and a regional economic integration framework.\"",
      "U.S. companies had mining operations in the region several decades ago, but they left when the armed conflict and corruption in regional governments made those operations too risky.",
      "DRC President Tshekedi has recently revisited legislation that could reform the country's tax code in ways that make its mining sector more appealing to Western business interests.",
      "Those proposed changes had already sparked new interest, with U.S. funding committed to develop the Lobito Corridor \u2014 a rail line to connect the DRC's land-locked \"copper belt\" with an Angolan Atlantic Ocean port.",
      "In November, then-President Joe Biden visited Angola and saw the Lobito Corridor port operations first-hand. The following month, the\u00a0Biden administration announced an additional $560 million in U.S. funding for the project.",
      "Van Dalen said if the U.S. is able to manage the regional tension and keep a peace agreement in place, it would be \"high risk, with vast rewards, both for the region and the U.S. itself,\" adding that, in his view, it would also fit right in with \"Trump's transactional nature.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Tehran-based political analyst acknowledges Iran has been weakened by Israel's onslaught, but the official line is still one of defiance and solidarity.",
    "story": [
      "Unity and strength are the official lines coming from Iran's theocratic government in the face of President Trump's demand for \"unconditional surrender\" and the possibility that he could order the U.S. military to join Israel's attacks on the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities.",
      "Israel's daily, nearly weeklong bombardment of Iran's nuclear and missile sites, and its assassinations of top commanders and senior scientists, have compounded the dilemma for Iran's leaders \u2014 especially as they face the potential of internal unrest from a population under attack.",
      "At least 639 Iranians have been killed and more than 1,300 wounded over the past six days, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists in Iran organization, which relies on a network of contacts in the country. Tens of thousands of Tehran's roughly 10 million residents have now fled the capital, and other cities have also emptied out to some degree, with many people seeking safer spaces in the countryside.",
      "But Iran's ruling Muslim clerics and their adherents don't talk about an exodus. Instead, they project solidarity, and even mock President Trump and his ultimatums.",
      "\"I just laugh at how negligent he is,\" Hamidreza Gholamzadeh, director of the Iranian think tank Diplo House, told CBS News in a remote interview from Tehran on Thursday. \"He does not know anything about Iranians, either in history, or the characteristics of the Iranian nation.\"",
      "\"Even Iranian dissident figures are now pro-Iran,\" he claimed, \"because they know it is about [maintaining] the integrity of Iran, the whole being of Iran.\"",
      "But after a week of bruising attacks by Israel, and with the threat of more to come and even possible direct U.S. intervention looming on the horizon, the optimism and bluster may be getting harder to maintain.",
      "\"Let's say, the power of Iran in the region has been weakened. It's not something that you can deny,\" acknowledged Gholamzadeh. \"But the government itself has not been weakened at all. The Iranians are very united right now. The social cohesion is very strong right now.\"",
      "At most, Gholamzadeh claimed 20% of all Iranians would be happy to see their government fall.",
      "\"There might be 10% to 15% who are against the state, but not all of them would be participating in any activities\" against the regime, he said, suggesting only 5% of Iranians would actually come out onto the streets \"to actively participate.\"",
      "But recent surveys conducted before the current war, by independent organizations based outside Iran, found quite the opposite.",
      "In 2023, following mass anti-government protests sparked the previous year by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in religious police custody, a survey by the Netherlands-based Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran found that 81% of the country's residents were against the cleric-led Iranian regime.",
      "The 2022 anti-government protests were quashed, brutally, and nothing like them has been seen in Iran since. Censorship is rife, and Iran's government has significantly curbed internet access over the last week, citing cyberthreats.",
      "Gholamzadeh repeated warnings issued by Iran's leaders, against the U.S. becoming actively involved in the conflict.",
      "\"Americans have a lot of military bases in different countries here in the region,\" he noted, calling them \"very easy targets.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Ted Cruz sparred with media personality Tucker Carlson, highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies over whether to join Israel's campaign against Iran.",
    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

      "Democrats in\u00a0Washington, D.C., are misrepresenting major criticisms of President Trump\u2019s \"big beautiful bill\" with incorrect facts, according to an expert who spoke to Fox News Digital this week as Trump\u2019s budget reconciliation package is debated in Congress.",
      "\"The bill doesn't cut benefits for anyone who has income below the poverty line, anyone who is working at least 20 hours a week and not caring for a child, and people who are Americans,\" Jim Agresti, president and cofounder of Just Facts, told Fox News Digital in response to criticisms from Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Sen. Josh Hawley, that Trump\u2019s bill will cut Medicaid and disproportionately hurt the poor.",
      "\"In other words, it cuts out illegal immigrants who are not Americans and fraudsters. So that narrative has no basis in reality. See, what's been going on since the Medicaid program was started? Is that it's been expanded and expanded and extended. You know, it got its start in 1966. And since that time, the poverty rate has stayed roughly level around 11% to 15%. While the portion of people in the United States on Medicaid has skyrocketed from 3% to 29%. Right now, 2.5 times more people are on Medicaid than are in poverty.\"",
      "Medicaid cuts and reform have been a\u00a0major sticking point with Democrats, who\u00a0have merged data from two new reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to back up claims that nearly 14 million would lose coverage. The White House and Republicans have objected, as not all the policy proposals evaluated were actually included in Republicans' legislation, and far fewer people would actually face insurance loss.",

      "\"I agree,\" Dem. Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u00a0said in response to a claim on CNN that Republicans \"want poor people to die\" with Medicaid cuts.",
      "Agresti told Fox News Digital that the Medicaid cuts are aimed\u00a0at bringing people out of poverty and waste.",
      "\"It's putting some criteria down to say, 'Hey, if you want this, and you're not in poverty, you need to work,'\" Agresti said. \"You need to do something to better your situation, which is what these programs are supposed to be, lifting people out of poverty, not sticking them there for eternity. So the whole idea is to get people working, give them an incentive. Hey, if you want to do better in life, and you want this Medicaid coverage, then you have to earn it.\"",
      "Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0has claimed the bill is a \"death sentence for the working class,\" because it raises health insurance \"copayments for poor people.\"",

      "Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered a response speech to President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.\u00a0 (Joe Maher/Getty Images For Fane)",
      "Agresti called that claim \"outlandish.\"",
      "\"First of all, the Big Beautiful Bill does not raise copayments on anyone who's below the poverty line,\" he explained. \"Now, for people who are above the poverty line, it requires states to at least charge some sort of copayment, and it also reduces, actually, the max copayment from $100 per visit to $35 per visit.\"",
      "Agresti went on to explain that under the current system, \"people have basically free rein to just go to a doctor or an emergency room or any other place without any co-payment, and they're not in poverty.\"",
      "\"What ends up happening is they waste a ton of money,\" Agresti said. \"This has been proven through randomized control trials, which are the gold standard for social science analysis, where you have people in a lottery system, some people get the benefit, and some people don't, and what you end up seeing is that people who don't have to have skin in the game, abuse emergency rooms, they go there for a stuffy nose, rack up all this money, and it does nothing to improve their health. It's just wasteful.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Sanders Communications Director Anna Bahr said, \"Mr. Agresti\u2019s facts here are simply incorrect.\"",
      "Sanders' office added that \"nearly half of all enrollees on the ACA exchanges are Republicans\" and pointed to the House-passed reconciliation bill that Sanders' office argues \"says that if a worker can\u2019t navigate the maze of paperwork that the bill creates for Medicaid enrollees, they are barred from receiving ACA tax credits as well.\"",
      "\"But workers must earn at least $15,650 per year to qualify for tax credits on the ACA marketplaces \u2013 approximately equal to the annual income for a full-time worker earning the federal minimum wage.\"",
      "Sanders' office also pointed to \"CBO estimates that 16 million people will lose insurance as a result of the House-passed bill and the Republicans ending the ACA\u2019s enhanced premium tax credits.\"",
      "Sanders' office also reiterated that the House-passed bill makes a \"fundamental change\" to copay for Medicaid beneficiaries, shifting from optional to mandatory.",
      "\"While claiming that I\u2019m \u2018incorrect,\u2019 Sanders\u2019 staff fails to provide a single fact that shows the BBB cuts health care for poor working Americans,\" Agresti responded.",
      "\"It\u2019s especially laughable that they cite expanded Obamacare subsidies in this context, because people in poverty aren\u2019t even eligible for them,\" Agresti continued. \"After this \u2018temporary' Covid-era handout expires, people with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty level \u2014 or $150,600 for a family of five \u2014 will still be eligible for this welfare program, although they will receive less.\"",
      "Agresti argued that the claim a \"max $35 copay (for people who are not poor) \u2018hurts working families\u2019\" is not supported by research \"which makes generalizations and merely cites \u2018associations.'\"",
      "\"As commonly taught in high school math, association doesn\u2019t prove causation,\" Agresti said.",
      "Sanders' office told Fox News Digital, \"Mr. Agresti seems to believe that a working family of four earning only $32,150 per year doesn\u2019t deserve help affording their health care. Health care in the United States is more expensive than anywhere in the world. Terminating health care coverage for 16 million Americans and increasing health care costs for millions will make it harder for working people to afford the health care they need, even if Mr. Agresti doesn\u2019t agree.\"",
      "Agresti also took issue with the narrative that cuts cannot be made to Medicaid without cutting benefits to people who are entitled to them.",

      "\"The Government Accountability Office has put out figures that are astonishing, hundreds of billions of dollars a year are going to waste,\" Agresti said. \"So, yeah, some criteria to make sure that doesn't happen is a wise idea. Unfortunately, there is a ton of white-collar crime in this country, and this kind of crime is a white-collar crime. It's not committed with a gun, or by robbing or punching someone, it's committed by fraud, and there's an enormous amount of it.",
      "\"And the big, beautiful bill, again, seeks to rein that in by putting a criteria to make sure we're checking people's income, we're checking their assets. A lot of these federal programs, government health care programs, they've stopped checking assets. So you could be a lottery winner sitting on $3 million in cash and have very little income. And still get children's health insurance program benefits for your kids.\"",
      "Hawley said on Monday that he did not have a problem with some of the marquee changes to Medicaid that his House Republican counterparts wanted, including stricter work requirements, booting illegal immigrants from benefit rolls and rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the program that serves tens of millions of Americans.",
      "However, he noted that about 1.3 million Missourians rely on Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and contended that most were working.",
      "\"These are not people who are sitting around, these are people who are working,\" he said. \"They\u2019re on Medicaid because they cannot afford private health insurance, and they don't get it on the job.\"",
      "\"And I just think it's wrong to go to those people and say, \u2018Well, you know, we know you're doing the best, we know that you're working hard, but we're going to take away your health care access,\u2019\" he continued.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",

      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",

      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",

Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand.

      "Hacking keeps evolving, just like any other profession. Cybercriminals are always upgrading their tools, especially malware, to find new ways to scam people and steal data or money. The old tricks no longer work as well. Basic phishing rarely fools anyone twice, so hackers constantly look for new ways to break in.",
      "They rely on whatever grabs your attention and doesn't raise suspicion, things like social media ads, fake banking apps or updates that look completely normal. One of the fastest-growing threats in this space is Crocodilus.",

      "Crocodilus malware: What Android users must know now",
      "The\u00a0Crocodilus malware was first documented by ThreatFabric cybersecurity researchers in late March 2025. They highlighted its extensive data theft and remote control capabilities.",
      "Crocodilus uses Facebook to infect devices. It appears in ads that look normal, but once clicked, the malware installs itself on your device. In some cases, it mimicked banking and e-commerce apps in Poland, promising users free points in exchange for downloading an app. The link led to a fake site that delivered the malware. Although the ad was only live for a few hours, it still reached thousands of users, most of whom were over 35, a group more likely to have money in the bank.",
      "Smaller but growing campaigns have also been reported in the United States, where Crocodilus disguised itself as crypto wallet tools, mining apps and financial services. These fake apps are often distributed through social media ads or phishing links, targeting Android users who are less likely to question a \"legit-looking\" financial app. While not yet widespread, the presence of Crocodilus in the U.S. underscores its global reach and rapidly evolving tactics.",
      "ANDROID SECURITY UPGRADES OUTSMART SCAMS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY",
      "The Trojan has also been spotted in Spain, where it disguised itself as a browser update, targeting nearly every major Spanish bank. In Turkey, it posed as an online casino app. And the threat doesn't stop there.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with Crocodilus is its ability to add fake contacts to your phone, inserting entries like \"Bank Support\" into your contact list. So, if an attacker calls pretending to be from your bank, your phone may not flag it because it appears to be a trusted number, making social engineering scams much more convincing.",
      "The latest version also includes a more advanced seed phrase collector, especially dangerous for cryptocurrency users. Crocodilus monitors your screen and uses pattern matching to detect and extract sensitive data, such as private keys or recovery phrases, all before quietly sending it to the attacker.",

      "This kind of malware is designed for scale. It targets large groups, works across different regions and updates fast. It can pretend to be a bank, a shopping app or even something harmless like a browser update. The scary part is how normal it all looks. People are not expecting something this malicious to hide inside something that looks like a gift.",
      "The creators of Crocodilus understand how people think and act online. They are using that knowledge to build tools that work quietly and effectively. And they are not working alone.

      "7 expert tips to protect your Android from Crocodilus malware",
      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "Badminton is a game that requires quick footwork, fast reactions, and precise hand-eye coordination. To give a robot a chance on the court, the\u00a0ETH Zurich team equipped ANYmal-D with four legs for stability and agility, a dynamic arm to swing the racket, and a stereo camera to track the shuttlecock. The robot uses a reinforcement learning-based controller, which allows it to predict and react to the shuttlecock's movement in real-time. ANYmal-D can move around the court, adjust its posture, and time its swings, keeping rallies going with human players for up to 10 shots.",
      "NO TENNIS PARTNER? NO WORRIES WITH THIS AI ROBOT",
      "The technology behind ANYmal-D's badminton skills",
      "ANYmal-D's stereo camera serves as its eyes, constantly monitoring the shuttlecock. The robot uses a \"perception noise model\" to compare what it sees with data from its training, helping it track the shuttlecock even when it moves unpredictably. The robot can pitch its body to keep the shuttlecock in view, mimicking how a human player might lean in for a tricky shot.",

      "With the increasing sophistication of digital threats, safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial. Android is responding with a suite of new security features designed to protect you from scams, fraud, and device theft.",
      "These enhancements are primarily rolling out to devices running Android 16. Some protections, such as enhanced theft protection and AI-powered scam detection, are also becoming available on select devices running Android 10 and later via Google Play Services updates.",
      "The most advanced features, including Identity Check and device-level Advanced Protection, are initially launching on Google Pixel and Samsung devices with One UI 7, with plans to expand to other manufacturers as they update to Android 16. Let's take a look at how these innovations are making Android security smarter and more comprehensive.",

      "1. Smarter protections against phone call scams",
      "Phone scammers are becoming increasingly creative, often attempting to trick people into changing device security settings or granting risky permissions during calls. Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts. If you're screen-sharing during a call, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends.",

It can identify suspicious conversation patterns in real-time and warn you before you fall victim to a scam. This protection covers a wide range of scams, including toll road and billing fee scams, cryptocurrency scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, tech support scams, and more. All message analysis happens on your device, so your conversations stay private.",

      "3. Fighting fraud and impersonation with Key Verifier",
      "To help protect you from scammers who try to impersonate someone you know, Android is rolling out Key Verifier in Google Messages. This feature lets you and your contact verify each other's identity using public encryption keys, either by scanning a QR code or comparing numbers. If a contact's verification status changes, like after a SIM swap, you'll see a warning, giving you extra confidence that you're talking to the right person.",

Whether you want built-in luggage tracking from\u00a0July and\u00a0Mokobara, ski protection with\u00a0Peak integration, or Disney-themed Bluetooth tags from Pixbee, there are options to suit different needs. Soon, tags that are enabled with ultra-wideband, starting with moto tag, will provide improved nearby location tracking.",
      "Later this year, Find Hub will include satellite connectivity, allowing you to stay connected with friends and family even when cellular service is unavailable. For travelers, new partnerships with airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and Singapore Airlines will let you share your Bluetooth tag's location directly with these airlines.

      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana.

      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says Hugging Face has launched affordable open-source humanoid robots for home AI exploration.",
      "Hugging Face, a well-known name in AI development, is making big moves in the world of robotics. The company has just introduced two open-source humanoid robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini, designed to make advanced robotics more accessible to everyone, from researchers and developers to students and hobbyists.",

      "Meet HopeJR: The full-size humanoid for real-world tasks",
      "HopeJR is\u00a0Hugging Face's new full-size humanoid robot. It stands out for its impressive 66 actuated degrees of freedom. This means it can walk, move its arms, and perform a wide range of independent gestures, making it a versatile platform for research, experimentation, and even household tasks in the future. Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000. That is a fraction of what most full-scale humanoid robots cost, opening the door for smaller labs, schools, and dedicated enthusiasts to get involved in advanced robotics development.",

It can move its head, listen, speak, and interact with AI applications, making it a fun and practical tool for developers and educators alike.",
      "Reachy Mini is expected to cost between $250 and $300. It is designed to be a hands-on gateway into robotics, letting users build, customize, and experiment with embodied AI. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face Spaces, giving access to over 500,000 AI apps on the Hugging Face Hub.",

      "Both HopeJR and Reachy Mini are fully open source. This means anyone can assemble, rebuild, and understand how these robots work. Hugging Face's CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized that this approach helps keep robotics open and accessible rather than dominated by a handful of companies with proprietary black-box systems. The community-driven model encourages collaboration and innovation, allowing users to share their improvements and build on each other's work.",

      "\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",

      "Pamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.",
      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

Multifactor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for scammers to gain access, even if they have your password.",

Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts. By sharing experiences and staying informed, we strengthen our community's defense against cybercrime.",

      "Cost and pricing expectations for the Mercedes Vision V",
      "While Mercedes-Benz has not officially announced the price for the production version of the Vision V, early reports and industry speculation suggest that this luxury van could cost around $200,000, especially for models equipped with all the high-end features seen in the concept.",
      "For context, the current V-Class starts at about $60,000 in Germany and can exceed $100,000 with options, so it's reasonable to expect the Vision V to command a significant premium, positioning it well above existing luxury van offerings. As with most high-end vehicles, the final price will likely depend on customization and selected features, but the Vision V is clearly aimed at buyers seeking exclusivity and the ultimate in automotive luxury.",

      "In the past decade, healthcare data has become one of the most sought-after targets in cybercrime. From insurers to clinics, every player in the ecosystem handles some form of sensitive information.",
      "However, breaches do not always originate from hospitals or health apps. Increasingly, patient data is managed by third-party vendors offering digital services such as scheduling, billing and marketing.",
      "One such breach at a digital marketing agency serving dental practices recently exposed approximately 2.7 million patient profiles and more than 8.8 million appointment records.",

      "Massive healthcare data leak exposes millions: What you need to know",
      "Cybernews researchers have discovered a misconfigured MongoDB database exposing 2.7 million patient profiles and 8.8 million appointment records. The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",
      "The exposed data included names, birthdates, addresses, emails, phone numbers, gender, chart IDs, language preferences and billing classifications. Appointment records also contained metadata such as timestamps and institutional identifiers.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",
      "After the issue was reported, the database was secured. The duration of the exposure remains unknown, and there is no public evidence indicating whether the data was downloaded by malicious actors before being locked down.",

      "How healthcare data breaches lead to identity theft and insurance fraud",
      "The exposed data presents a broad risk profile. On its own, a phone number or billing record might seem limited in scope. Combined, however, the dataset forms a complete profile that could be exploited for identity theft, insurance fraud and targeted phishing campaigns.",
      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from healthcare data breaches",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",

      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "As Israel\u2019s battle to take out Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities continues, Iran\u2019s most heavily-protected nuclear facility at Fordow, two hours from Tehran, remains intact.",
      "Many military analysts believe that a two-ton precision bunker buster developed by and in sole possession of the U.S. is the only means of eliminating the Fordow site, which some claim may be capable of producing a nuclear warhead in as little as two to three days.",
      "Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how Israel or the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat.",
      "IN IRAN\u2019S \u2018FOREVER WAR\u2019 AGAINST THE US, REGIME HAS TARGETED, KILLED AMERICANS WORLDWIDE",
      "Illustration showing how a GBU-57 Bunker Buster is deployed. (Fox News\u00a0)",
      "Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to \"penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes\" underground. The explosion may either take out the target fully, or \"collapse the structure\" around the target \"without necessarily obliterating it,\" he explained.",
      "Bunker busters come in multiple weight classes. Israel possesses 2,000- and 5,000-pound varieties. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordinance Penetrator (MOP).",
      "Developed under President George W. Bush, Ruhe says the MOP was \"designed specifically\" for targets like Fordow, where nuclear sites or command and control bunkers are hidden far underground.",
      "Two separate bombs are dropped by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. (Fox News)",
      "Ruhe said that the number of munitions required to target Fordow depends on the depth of the facility. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies states that Fordow\u2019s facility is between 60 and 90 meters (196 to 295 feet) below ground. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi told The Financial Times last week that the facility reaches 800 meters underground.",
      "Ruhe said Grossi, who has been to the Fordow facility, may have been \"trying to message, \u2018hey, military action is not the solution here.\u2019\"",

      "The illustration shows the first bomb exploding and creating a hole. (Fox News)",
      "The MOP is said to have a penetration depth of 200 feet. Ruhe said that given Fordow\u2019s distance underground and the difficulty of penetrating the rocky mountainside the site is dug into, the U.S. would likely use a technique called burrowing, in which a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber would \"drop several MOPs in succession, one after the other.\"",
      "Fordow poses a unique target. Ruhe said that pilots have to take into account the facility\u2019s multiple, narrow exit tunnels, and achieve the right angle of impact to penetrate the ground.",
      "Though Israeli air dominance over Iran has eliminated the need for stealth air assets, Ruhe believes the stealth B-2 would be the only tool adequate for delivering the MOPs. Ruhe said timing constraints make the use of B-52 bombers \"not relevant.\"",
      "Additionally, Ruhe explained that talk of loaning B-2 bombers to the Israeli Air Force is \"a dangerous distraction.\" Not only is there \"0.0% chance\" that the U.S. would give out this strategic capability, but Ruhe says training Israeli pilots to fly the B-2 would take several months.",
      "A second bomb follows into the hole and explodes, causing more damage. (Fox News)",

      "Given that Israel is \"very tactically inventive\" and \"very good at maximizing the capabilities they do have,\" Ruhe says that Israel could achieve its goals at Fordow without the MOP.",
      "Not only did Ruhe offer the unlikely but not impossible scenario where Israel might \"storm the site in a commando raid,\" but he said that Israel could use F-15s, escorted by F-35s, to deliver multiple 5,000-pound bunker busters over Fordow, utilizing the same burrowing tactic the U.S. would likely employ.",

      "Such a strike, he admitted, would \"achieve a more limited definition of success\" than the MOP could.",
      "The U.S. and Israel are likely to have different goals in targeting Fordow, Ruhe said. \"Americans tend to think of obliterating targets,\" Ruhe said, whereas Israel would \"probably be fine with saying they knocked back the operations there by a year or so.\"",
      "Ruhe estimates that the bunker busters may not completely destroy the facility, but that it may be considered a success if it were to knock out the power source to Iranian centrifuges, or making \"the air too polluted\" for centrifuges to operate.",

      "However, Israel did not strike the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant \u2013 which is believed to be capable of producing a nuclear warhead in as little as two to three days, according to the Institute for Science and International Security \u2013 likely because Israel does not possess the military capabilities it would take to strike the Fordow facility, which is reported to be up to 300 feet underground.",

      "The only way to penetrate this facility may be by using a 30,000-pound bomb, known as the \"bunker buster,\" a GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) specifically designed to penetrate deeply buried targets, though even this capability is estimated to have a reach of some 200 feet, according to publicly available information.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:00:22 GMT",
    "summary": "If Trump bombs Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, the main risk would be from the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb itself rather than radiation or chemicals.",
    "story": [
      "If President Donald Trump does decide to use the United States' largest conventional bomb to destroy Iran\u2019s fortresslike Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, the colossal force of the explosion would likely cause casualties among workers or anyone else still at the site.",
      "But it would not trigger a nuclear explosion or a widespread radiological or chemical spill, according to former nuclear officials and experts.",
      "Sitting to the south of Iran's capital, Tehran, the Fordo plant is used to enrich uranium for the production of nuclear energy or, potentially, a bomb. But although this uranium and its chemical byproducts can be harmful to ingest or touch without protective equipment \u2014 they won\u2019t create a wider blast or regional contamination, analysts say.",
      "That would only be the case if Fordo housed nuclear reactors or warheads, which international watchdogs and experts say is not the case.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re down there and it gets bombed, you\u2019re stuffed,\u201d Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the ex-commanding officer of the British military\u2019s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s because this is a 2,500-kilogram (about 5,500-pound) warhead we are talking about here,\u201d he said, referring to the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (or MOP), the largest non-nuclear bomb in the world, which only the U.S. has.",
      "Less of a bunker-buster and more of a mountain-buster, this is perhaps the only conventional ordnance in the world that could do the job if Trump did decide to bomb Fordo.",
      "\u201cBut if anyone thinks this would be like Chernobyl \u2014 absolutely not,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said. \u201cBlowing up uranium will not create a nuclear explosion; that is a very complex piece of science, which is why it\u2019s so bloody difficult to make nuclear bombs.\u201d",
      "There is also little chance of a wider radiation leak or spill impacting the surrounding area, according to Mark Nelson, founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, a research consultancy based in Chicago.",
      "That\u2019s because \u201cthe nuclear substances at Fordo are only very weakly radioactive,\u201d he said. Were this a nuclear plant or missile site, there could be \u201cfission products\u201d \u2014 the stuff uranium breaks down into during a nuclear reaction \u2014 which can cause a wider catastrophe.",
      "Scrutiny has nonetheless sharpened on Fordo as Trump deliberates whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced enrichment facility, Fordo was refining uranium to 60%, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\u2019s far more than the 3-5% needed for power plants \u2014 and far closer to the 90% required to build a warhead.",
      "Until 2018, Iran had been complying with a landmark deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program.",
      "The agreement was sealed by President Barack Obama in July 2015, along with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union. Most independent observers said it was successfully limiting Iran's nuclear program.",
      "That effectively collapsed when Trump walked away from the pact three years later.",
      "Iran had been back in talks with Trump when Israel started bombing last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had no choice because Iran was racing toward building a bomb, something the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has not been able to confirm.",
      "The watchdog has been nonetheless concerned about Fordo, where uranium\u2019s naturally mined form is turned into a gas and spun at high speed inside centrifuges. That separates its heavier isotope, uranium-238, from the lighter uranium-235 that can be used for civilian purposes or otherwise.",
      "Iran says Fordo was designed to hold 3,000 of these centrifuges, a \u201csize and configuration\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with a peaceful program,\u201d Obama said in 2009.",
      "Observers such as de Bretton-Gordon say the U.S.\u2019s enormous MOP bomb might be powerful enough not only to destroy this facility but effectively incase it under the collapsed mountain. That could produce a similar effect to the sarcophagus built around Chernobyl after the disaster in 1986, Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Whereas Chernobyl\u2019s protective enclosure is 40 feet thick, \u201cat Fordo we would be talking about a sarcophagus 200-feet thick,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the risk of contamination would be zero.",
      "If the uranium gas is released, it would partly decompose into hydrofluoric acid, a deadly substance that causes deep-tissue burns if touched without protective gear, and potentially fatal problems for the heart, lungs and nervous system if inhaled.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty chemical to be around without correct safety equipment and procedures,\u201d said Nelson at the Radiant Energy Group. Any blast survivors, or rescuers without the necessary safety equipment, would face \u201cextremely severe\u201d consequences, he said, but caveated that \u201cyou have to be really close and really unprotected.\u201d",
      "There is also a chance that radioactive material could seep into any water source that\u2019s running through the mountain. But the likely radioactive levels would be low \u2014 detectable rather than harmful \u2014 both Nelson and de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Ultimately, Nelson agreed, all of these risks pale in comparison with the threat posed by the MOP bomb itself, whose payload is upward of 5,500 pounds and weighs a total of 30,000 pounds.",
      "\u201cThe danger at the seaside of saltwater ingestion is real \u2014 even a few liters could kill you,\u201d he analogized. \u201cThis danger, however, is relatively small compared to drowning.\u201d"

      "But it wasn't immediately clear in the minutes after Farbiarz's ruling when Khalil could be set free, from his current hold at a detention center in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "Magistrate Judge Michael Hammer said Khalil will have to \"surrender his passport and any other travel documents\" as a condition of his release.",
      "Judge Farbiarz, though, made it clear Khalil needs to be released from custody on Friday.",
      "Khalil has a green card, is married to a U.S. citizen and has no criminal record.",
      "\"No one should fear being jailed for speaking out in this country,\u201d said Khalil's attorney Alina Das, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at New York University School of Law. \u201cWe are overjoyed that Mr. Khalil will finally be reunited with his family while we continue to fight his case in court.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s removal, arguing he poses a national security risk.",
      "The Cold War-era statute gives the secretary of state authority to \u201cpersonally determine\u201d whether Khalil should remain in the country, the administration has argued.",
      "But Khalil's backers have insisted that the government's actions are meant to stifle free speech on college campuses and silence opponents of Israel's ongoing military action in Gaza.",
      "Israeli forces rolled into Gaza shortly after Hamas invaded the country on Oct. 7, 2023, in a terrorist attack that killed about 1,200 people. It's been estimated that 251 hostages were taken by Hamas terrorists.",
      "More than  55,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war against Hamas.",
      "Representatives of the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be immediately reached for comment following  Farbiarz's ruling."

      "While in Los Angeles, Vance is expected to deliver remarks as well as tour federal facilities, including a mobile command center, and meet with Marines.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential contender, didn't receive formal notice about Vance's trip in advance, the governor's deputy director of communications, Brandon Richards, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe Governor would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Vice President in service to Californians,\" Richards said. \"We\u2019re always open to working together \u2014 which makes it all the more disappointing that the White House chose not to engage with us directly ahead of the visit. We\u2019ve yet to receive any official notice of the Vice President\u2019s trip \u2014 which, from what we understand, is focused on a high-dollar fundraiser.\u201d",
      "Vance's visit to the city is the latest in the battle between Democrats and the Trump administration over its hard-line deportation policies after an appeals court ruled in the president's favor Thursday.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it's \"likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority\" in deploying California National Guard troops to respond to protests in L.A. The decision stemmed from the lawsuit California Attorney General Rob Bonta brought against the Trump administration after Trump sent the troops to the city without the approval of Newsom.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Northern Command said that it was activating 2,000 additional National Guard troops in L.A. to \u201csupport the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area.\u201d That brings the total number of National Guard troops deployed to the city to more than 4,000 since the protests erupted there earlier this month. The president also deployed U.S. Marines to assist law enforcement in the response to demonstrations.",
      "The president and his administration's immigration actions have sparked outrage among Democratic lawmakers, including California Sen. Alex Padilla, who was forcibly removed and handcuffed after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a briefing last week.",
      "The protests formed after ICE agents raided three places in central L.A. in early June, triggering a domino effect of similar demonstrations nationwide. While they've dissipated in recent weeks, one began on Thursday when federal agents working with ICE came to Dodger Stadium and \u201crequested permission to access the parking lots.\u201d The Major League Baseball team, however, said that it blocked immigration agents from entering the ballpark."

      "An attorney for Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Antonio Cartagena, said the allegations are \u201ccomplete fabrications\u201d intended to damage the rapper\u2019s reputation.",
      "The lawsuit says that Dixon was the rapper\u2019s hype man, or on-stage entertainer, but also contributed as his lyricist, background vocalist, bodyguard and \u201ccreative collaborator\u201d from about 2005 to 2022.",
      "It alleges that Dixon authored or co-authored dozens of songs, including \u201cCongratulations,\u201d \u201cIce Cream,\u201d \u201cNo Problems\u201d and \u201cBlack Out.\u201d",

      "The 157-page document, which comes with a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d at the top, also details allegations of sexual abuse.",
      "It alleges that Cartagena routinely brought women back to his hotel rooms and forced Dixon to engage in sexual acts with them, sometimes in front of members of the rapper\u2019s inner circle. According to the suit, Cartagena \u201cfrequently arranged and orchestrated these encounters, intentionally creating scenarios designed to reinforce Plaintiff\u2019s complete submission.\u201d",
      "It accuses Cartagena of remaining in the room to watch, record and \u201cprovide explicit direction and commands.\u201d",
      "Dixon did not want to participate in the acts, the lawsuit states, but did so \u201csolely out of fear of immediate retaliation.\u201d During one alleged incident, Dixon refused, and Cartagena canceled his flight home, leaving Dixon stranded with no money, the suit says.",
      "Dixon said that over a 16-year period, he estimates that he was \u201ccoerced into more than 4,000 sexual acts to maintain his standing within the enterprise.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that Dixon personally witnessed Cartagena engage in sexual relations with 15 and 16-year-old girls.",
      "Cartagena\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said Dixon\u2019s lawsuit is a \u201cblatant act of retaliation\u201d and a \u201cdesperate attempt to deflect attention\u201d from a civil lawsuit the rapper filed in April accusing Dixon and his attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, of extortion, slander and defamation.",
      "That lawsuit from Cartagena says that things ended amicably with Dixon in 2019 and it wasn\u2019t until years later that Dixon alleged that he had been underpaid while working with the rapper.",
      "The suit says that Cartagena compensated Dixon \u201chandsomely\u201d for assisting him on tour and denies Dixon\u2019s allegations that the rapper had sexual relations with minors. It further accuses Dixon and Blackburn of trying to extort Cartagena for money.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t just sue a disgruntled former employee trying to revive a false claim from 15 years ago \u2014 we sued the lawyer behind it all,\u201d Tacopina said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications \u2014 lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. Mr. Cartagena will not be intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.\u201d",
      "In response, Blackburn said Friday that Cartagena \u201cis desperate and grasping for straws.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe met with law enforcement, let\u2019s wait and see who they believe,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit says Dixon suffered severe emotional injuries, including chronic anxiety, debilitating fear and symptoms consistent with PTSD. He remains in trauma-informed therapy, the suit says."

      "Tesla\u2019s long-overdue robotaxi is finally hitting the streets this weekend, but the rollout may face some roadblocks.",
      "The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company is expected to roll out robotaxis in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the first driverless trip from the factory to a customer house expected on his birthday, June 28.",
      "Musk shared news of the tentative debut in a post on social media platform X last week.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the Tesla event so far.",
      "When and where",
      "The launch will include a limited number of Tesla vehicles debuting in Austin on June 22. The initial rides will be in the Model Y and not the CyberCab that was unveiled in October.",
      "Access to the vehicles and rides is by invitation only. Some influencers on social media have reported receiving early access invites to test out the new service starting Sunday.",
      "The rides will also occur in a geofenced area of the city and remote drivers will be monitoring as a backup.",
      "Musk told CNBC\u2019s David Faber that robotaxis will only operate in the parts of Austin that the company would \u201cconsider to be the safest\u201d and said Tesla will be \u201cwatching\u201d the cars in remote operations centers.",
      "Can Musk deliver on promises?",
      "Musk has long touted a driverless robotaxi, and the pressure is on the billionaire to deliver on his promises. As early as 2019, Musk said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that robotaxis would launch in 2020.",
      "In May, Musk confirmed plans to debut the service in Austin this month, with launches later set for Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, Musk said the service would launch with 10 vehicles circulating Austin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s prudent for us to start with a small number, confirm that things are going well and then scale it up,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s Faber.",
      "Wall Street analysts such as Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives believe robotaxis will usher in the \u201cgolden era of autonomous for Tesla\u201d that could power its market capitalization to more than $2 trillion by the end of next year.",
      "That\u2019s about double its market value from Wednesday\u2019s close.",
      "\u201cThere will be many setbacks ... but given its unmatched scale and scope globally we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the U.S. and around the globe,\u201d he wrote in a note.",
      "Tesla, once seen as a self-driving tech leader, is now a laggard, trying to catch up to Alphabet-owned Waymo in the U.S.",
      "Waymo, which said it reached 10 million trips in May, is already operating a fleet of commercial robotaxis across the U.S. and is also seeking permission to test its autonomous vehicles, with a human safety driver on board, in New York City.",
      "Regulatory hurdles and opposition",
      "Tesla faces a bumpy road ahead, littered with regulatory hurdles and pushback from lawmakers.",
      "On Wednesday, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Texas called on Tesla to push off its robotaxi launch until Sept. 1, when Texas rolls out a new slate of self-driving laws.",
      "\u201cWe believe this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public transit operation,\u201d the group said in a letter addressed to Tesla\u2019s field quality director, Eddie Gates. They also asked for \u201cdetailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law\u201d if it goes ahead with the launch.",
      "Public safety advocates protested the launch in Austin earlier this month.",
      "A group known as The Dawn Project, a tech safety organization that is critical of Tesla\u2019s autonomous capabilities, demonstrated a Tesla Model Y with currently available \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d software running past a stopped school bus and hitting a child-sized mannequin. The group said it was a situation where the software misread the elements in the road.",
      "\u201cAny human ... following the law would have stopped when they saw the school bus stopped with the lights flashing. They would have stopped,\u201d Dawn Project founder Dan O\u2019Dowd told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Friday.",
      "O\u2019Dowd, who also runs Green Hills Software, a company that sells technology to Tesla competitors, told CNBC that the software is \u201cnowhere near done\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taking to the streets.",
      "\u201cThis software does not know how to recognize a school bus,\u201d he said.",
      "Tesla\u2019s FSD capabilities, which feature a standard FSD or FSD supervised, include automatic steering and parking, but have been connected to accidents and fatalities, according to data tracked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",
      "Tesla under fire",
      "Tesla\u2019s brand has taken several hits in recent months with a decline in sales and reputational damage linked to Musk\u2019s political activities.",
      "Musk was a major supporter of President Donald Trump, funneling hundreds of millions into his reelection campaign and later spearheading his Department of Government Efficiency effort aimed at cutting costs. He left the department at the end of May.",
      "Musk\u2019s close ties to Trump\u2019s White House have caused owners to part with the brand and in some cases led to violence, with showrooms and vehicles targeted in arson and vandalism attacks.",
      "But the relationship between Musk and Trump soured earlier this month after the tech titan berated the president\u2019s spending bill on X, leading to a drastic sell-off in the stock. He later apologized for his social media posts, saying some \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "The EV maker is also seeing a global sales decline weighing on key markets such as the U.S. and Europe. Vehicle sales in Europe tanked 49% from a year ago in April, while global first-quarter deliveries dropped 13%.",
      "The decline was tied to a combination of Musk\u2019s politics and heightened competition in the EV market.",

It\u2019s a very bad \u2014 it\u2019s a very bad thing that\u2019s happening over there. I think he wants to stop, but I could answer that question better in two weeks or four weeks from now.\"",

But as you know, we have about 150 plus and you can\u2019t do that. So we\u2019re going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries and telling them what the deal is, like I did with E.U.,\" Trump responded.",

It\u2019s just the science for me: calories in, versus calories out. Ozempic works because you eat less food. That\u2019s it. It makes you feel full.

      "\u201cMy back was in such a bad place where I couldn\u2019t stand for more than like 15 minutes at a time. I had to sit down and do figure 4s and stretch my back out during dance rehearsal for tour,\u201d she said.",

      "It alleges that Roc Nation either knew or should have known about the rapper\u2019s behavior but took no action. Roc Nation, which is named as a defendant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "The 157-page document, which comes with a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d at the top, also details allegations of sexual abuse.",
      "It alleges that Cartagena routinely brought women back to his hotel rooms and forced Dixon to engage in sexual acts with them, sometimes in front of members of the rapper\u2019s inner circle. According to the suit, Cartagena \u201cfrequently arranged and orchestrated these encounters, intentionally creating scenarios designed to reinforce Plaintiff\u2019s complete submission.\u201d",
      "It accuses Cartagena of remaining in the room to watch, record and \u201cprovide explicit direction and commands.\u201d",
      "Dixon did not want to participate in the acts, the lawsuit states, but did so \u201csolely out of fear of immediate retaliation.\u201d During one alleged incident, Dixon refused, and Cartagena canceled his flight home, leaving Dixon stranded with no money, the suit says.",
      "Dixon said that over a 16-year period, he estimates that he was \u201ccoerced into more than 4,000 sexual acts to maintain his standing within the enterprise.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that Dixon personally witnessed Cartagena engage in sexual relations with 15 and 16-year-old girls.",
      "Cartagena\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said Dixon\u2019s lawsuit is a \u201cblatant act of retaliation\u201d and a \u201cdesperate attempt to deflect attention\u201d from a civil lawsuit the rapper filed in April accusing Dixon and his attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, of extortion, slander and defamation.",
      "That lawsuit from Cartagena says that things ended amicably with Dixon in 2019 and it wasn\u2019t until years later that Dixon alleged that he had been underpaid while working with the rapper.",
      "The suit says that Cartagena compensated Dixon \u201chandsomely\u201d for assisting him on tour and denies Dixon\u2019s allegations that the rapper had sexual relations with minors. It further accuses Dixon and Blackburn of trying to extort Cartagena for money.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t just sue a disgruntled former employee trying to revive a false claim from 15 years ago \u2014 we sued the lawyer behind it all,\u201d Tacopina said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications \u2014 lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. Mr. Cartagena will not be intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.\u201d",
      "In response, Blackburn said Friday that Cartagena \u201cis desperate and grasping for straws.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe met with law enforcement, let\u2019s wait and see who they believe,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit says Dixon suffered severe emotional injuries, including chronic anxiety, debilitating fear and symptoms consistent with PTSD. He remains in trauma-informed therapy, the suit says."

      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It\u2019s the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun\u2019s annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun\u2019s paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "Solstices are when days and nights are at their most extreme",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "The equinox is when there is an equal amount of day and night",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2014 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "What\u2019s the difference between meteorological and astronomical seasons?",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1."

    "story": [
      "The reviews are in!",
      "The new live-action remake of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has  arrived; we asked the real experts, kids, what they think about it.",
      "The film, which stars Mason Thames as Hiccup, Nico Parker as Astrid and Gerard Butler as Stoick, hit theaters on June 13.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Butler talked about the movie and revealed how it paid homage to the 2010 animated version, which was inspired by the best-selling book series of the same name.",
      "Butler said \"a fine line had to be tread to pay homage to the original to keep the essence of the story.\" However, with director Dean DeBlois at the helm, he said that the cast was able to \"bring something that felt real fresh and original\" to the film.",
      "What are kids saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY.com spoke with kids about the movie, and the reviews were generally positive. Joseph, 12, who adored the movie, says he thinks the remake is \"an amazing movie for all ages.\u201d",
      "\"I thought it was awesome. It had good graphics. It looked like real dragons, and I think it moved nicely,\" he says.",
      "Wylie, also 12, agrees.",
      "\"I thought it was really good. A lot of time when they remake old movies, they change the story or something like that. They didn\u2019t do that here at all. The movie itself looked great. Everything was well paced,\" he says.",
      "Any suggestions for improvement? Ruby, 9, thought that the movie could've been better if it had no intimate scenes.",
      "\"I hate the kissing,\" she says. On the other hand, Clara, 9, says that she wanted \"more kissing.\"",
      "(For the record, the kissing scene between the two young lead actors is quite minimal and chaste.)",
      "Wylie, a huge fan of the original series, says the film did a good job representing all the characters, both human and dragon.",
      "But Ruby and Jane, 7, say they were displeased with how the movie brought Gronckle, the most ferocious dragon in the film, to life, as well as some of the other beasts.",
      "\"The Gronckle looks weird,\" Ruby tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"One thing I would change about the movie is Gronckle because it doesn't look like the cartoon,\" Jane adds. \"The Hideous Zippleback, the Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare don\u2019t look anything like the cartoon.\"",
      "When asked if the remake was better than the cartoon, Jane declares,  \"It's a tie.\"",
      "Emma, 8, said the remake met all of her expectations.",
      "\"I love it so much. I love it. I love everything,\" she said. \"But I\u2019m so sad that Hiccup had to lose his leg, even though it\u2019s necessary. I cried like, maybe twice, maybe even three times. And it\u2019s a great movie. I really, really recommend it.\"",
      "What are parents saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY Digital reporter Rosie Colosi McDevitt saw the film with her daughters, Ruby and Jane, their friends, and her husband, Ryan.",
      "She said if other parents plan to take their kids to see \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" then there's some things they should look out for, like the jump scares in the movie and how real the monstrous beasts looked.",
      "\"They looked as real and scary as the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park,'\" she said. \"There were even a handful of jump scares. The sweet 7-year-old on my left clutched my arm and said, 'I\u2019m scared!' five different times, but the 4-year-old on my right was having a grand old time.\"",
      "As for Ryan, he says \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has a questionable moral lesson, from an adult perspective. He says he also realized that the film is \"a lot harsher\" than the animated version.",
      "\"It\u2019s a little bit more graphic ...  I don\u2019t know if I would change this, but kids are supposed to listen to their parents. In this case, Hiccup didn\u2019t listen to his father, but he turned out to be right, so that means the message is \u2026 don\u2019t listen to your parents?\" he wondered.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d focuses on the friendship between Hiccup, a young Viking lad, and his dragon, Toothless. Although his Viking village and the dragons are bitter historical enemies,  Hiccup and Toothless must come together to save their family and friends against a greater threat.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 rated?",
      "The movie is rated PG, which stands for parental guidance. This means that some material in the movie may not be suitable for young kids and parents should decide whether or not the film is appropriate for their kids to watch",
      "How is 'How to Train Your Dragon' different from the original?",
      "Bringing animated characters to life was no easy task. Butler said that he and the cast knew that they had some big shoes to fill for their roles, so they always thought about how they could make things \u201cmore richer and more nuanced\u201d for the remake.",
      "\u201cThis just sucks you in and it becomes its own story,\u201d he says of the remake. \u201cHow could anyone who\u2019s seeing this movie for the first time not be blown away or really enthralled and thrilled?\u201d",
      "Other than the effects, which brings the animated film to life, Butler said nothing comes close to the feeling that viewers will get from watching real actors play the roles.",
      "\u201cThe ability to see actual sadness, anger, fear, whatever that is, it makes it ultimately, a more powerful, emotional, relatable experience,\u201d he said."

      "The Buckley family\u2019s shady dealings caught up with them by the finale of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Waterfront.\u201d",
      "The show created by Kevin Williamson follows a fishing family dynasty in the fictional Havenport, North Carolina, as they struggle to financially stay afloat. The family\u2019s patriarch, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany), stepped away from leading the restaurant and fishery due to his health, leaving son Cane (Jake Weary) to take his place.",
      "The show, which hit Netflix June 19, opens with two of the Buckleys\u2019 employees being murdered after Cane decided to take on drug smuggling runs using the company\u2019s boats to bring in extra cash.",
      "From there, the entire family, including mom Belle (Maria Bello) and daughter Bree (Melissa Benoist), is implicated in Harlan and Cane\u2019s criminal activity, culminating in a final faceoff against Grady (Topher Grace), a supplier at the helm of the rapidly unraveling drug operation.",
      "And by the end of Episode 8, Williamson, known for creating \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s time for a new Buckley \u201cto step forward\u201d as leader of the pack.",
      "Below, read a breakdown of all the twists and turns in \u201cThe Waterfront\u201d Season 1 finale.",
      "How Does 'The Waterfront' End?",
      "\u201cThe Waterfront\u201d finale picks up right where Episode 7 ended, with yet another kidnapping. This time, it\u2019s Bree and her estranged son, Diller (Brady Hepner).",
      "Seeking revenge against the Buckleys, Grady took the mother and son to try and draw out patriarch Harlan, who was responsible for blowing up the farm where he produced opium.",
      "Back at the house, the family, which now firmly includes Shawn (Rafael Silva), revealed to be Harlan\u2019s son from an affair, hatches a plan to get Bree back. While Harlan pretends to surrender, Cane and Shawn sneak onto Grady\u2019s boat to free Bree and Diller.",
      "But before they arrive, Bree tries to fight back on her own. As a result, she\u2019s shot in the leg and thrown overboard. Diller throws her a life-saving kit, complete with a raft and flare gun.",
      "Unable to find Bree, Cane and Shawn reveal themselves to save Harlan, starting a shootout with Grady and his men.",
      "Who Dies in 'The Waterfront' Finale?",
      "In a final standoff on the boat, Harlan, Cane and Grady go face to face. Held at gunpoint by the father and son, Grady puts his weapon down.",
      "Taunting Cane for being unable to pull the trigger, Grady turns to Harlan and asks, \u201cYou want this guy for a son?\u201d",
      "Cane then shoots Grady multiple times in the face, and he falls into the water.",
      "Meanwhile afloat on the life raft, Bree falls in and out of consciousness before her family arrives to her rescue and rushes her to the hospital.",
      "In the waiting room, Cane appears haunted by the murder, but Harlan reassures him, \u201cGrady never would have stopped. ... You were protecting your family.\u201d",
      "Weary, who plays Cane, tells TODAY.com that the final murder represents a turning point for him.",
      "\u201cI think he crosses the threshold into the life of crime that he maybe never saw himself being thrust into,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it does come from a place of need, that he needs to protect his family and that means taking a life .... It\u2019s also proving to his father that he\u2019s capable of doing these things, and making him proud in a morbid way.\u201d",
      "What Does Belle Do?",
      "The show seemingly wraps on a high note for the Buckley family. Belle and Harlan reaffirm their love for each other, Cane reconnects with his wife Peyton (Danielle Campbell) after carrying on an affair, and Bree is reunited with Diller. Meanwhile, the new sheriff, Drew, tells Harlan the boat was \"all clean\" of any evidence, suggesting they quite literally got away with murder.",
      "Williamson says Season 1 is only the beginning for the Buckleys.",
      "\u201cBree has earned her place. She's no longer on the outside, she's no longer an outcast,\" Williamson says. \"And I think Cane has grown and he's gotten some answers. ... I think he's sort of reconciling his life choices.",
      "\"Harlan is going back to a life of crime, which he wears very well, and he kind of finds his purpose again,\" he adds. \"And I think Belle \u2014 we've just barely brushed the surface of this family.\"",
      "At the very end, Belle\u2019s previous attempt to save the Buckley enterprise comes back around. While Cane turned to drug running to raise the funds needed to keep their business open, Belle worked with Wes Benson (Dave Annable) to potentially sell some of their waterfront property in Havenport. Over the course of the dealings, Belle carried on an affair with Wes.",
      "Belle eventually backed out of the land deal, claiming the sale would \"kill\" Harlan. But having knowledge of the family's finances, Wes goes behind her back to buy up some of the Buckley family's debts, effectively taking away control of the property.",
      "While Harlan was furious at Belle going behind his back, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop her from doing it again. To get rid of some bodies at the fishery, Belle enlists the help of, in Williamson's words, a \"new threat in town\" \u2014 the Parkers.",
      "Belle calls on Emmett Parker, part of another crime-running family responsible for killing Harlan's father decades ago. Emmett reminds her of their shared history and says he's on her side.",
      "\"Maybe you should be in charge,\" he tells her. \"If you ever needed a favor, I could be a friend to you.\"",
      "Later at the hospital, Belle takes a call from Emmett.",
      "\"We'll help you with the land deal, but only if you take over,\" he says.",
      "The very last scene of Season 1 reveals that she took that deal. She walks into the fish house to find Emmett, with Wes tied up and brutally beaten.",
      "\"We'll need his complete loyalty, to both of us,\" Emmett explains after Belle asks if they're going to kill him.",
      "Emmett then rips the tape off Wes' mouth and says, \"Well, what do you have to say to your new boss?\"",
      "Williamson says Belle's turn to crime boss was a long time coming.",
      "\u201cShe married into the Buckleys, and I think she has always pulled the strings in the shadows,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cI think by the end, she realizes she\u2019s more of a Buckley than Harlan \u2014 and that it's time for her to stand front and center and he needs to sit down.",
      "\"She's tired of having to go through him and convince him and sort of work with him,\" he adds. \"And now she's just going to take charge.\"",
      "Overall, Season 1 leaves the Buckleys and Belle \u201cbeholden to this other crime family \u2014 and that's not going to go well,\" Williamson says."

      "\u201cThis will honestly piss off my fans, but absolutely,\u201d Carpenter said when asked about the possibility of requiring concert-goers to drop their phones into pouches during her shows.",
      "The \u201cEspresso\u201d singer said that her opinion on having phones at concerts changed after she attended a Silk Sonic concert in Los Vegas at which she had to lock up her own phone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a better experience at a concert,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "\u201cI genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies \u2014 wasn\u2019t alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone\u2019s singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.\u201d",

I\u2019m not just talking about me. I\u2019m talking about every female artist that is making art right now \u2026. We\u2019re in such a weird time where you would think it\u2019s girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it,\u201d she told Rolling Stone.",
      "That scrutiny is also part of what might be motivating the \u201cManchild\u201d singer to support banning phones at her concert, telling the magazine that even though she\u2019s grown up in an age of fans having iPhones at shows, there\u2019s also a downside.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t blame people for wanting to have memories. But depending on how long I want to be touring, and what age I am, girl, take those phones away. You cannot zoom in on my face. Right now, my skin is soft and supple. It\u2019s fine. Do not zoom in on me when I\u2019m 80 years old up there,\u201d she added.",
      "Carpenter\u2019s latest album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d recently made headlines for its provocative cover art, which was released on June 11. The image depicts the \u201cBed Chem\u201d singer wearing a black dress, on all fours next to a man\u2019s leg, with his hand clutching her hair.",

      "As for constantly being commented on online, Carpenter told Rolling Stone, \u201cWhen you get down the little rabbit hole is truly when people start commenting on you as a person or you physically. All of those things that you\u2019re already thinking on a day-to-day basis. You don\u2019t need a stranger from Arkansas to remind you.\u201d"

      "In the last three episodes of \u201cWe Were Liars,\u201d Prime Video\u2019s new psychological-thriller series, the long-running mystery finally unravels, and Cadence Sinclair Eastman learns the truth about what really happened on Beechwood Island during the summer of her accident.",
      "As her memory returns, so does the unbearable reality: Her three closest friends \u2014 Mirren, Johnny and Gat \u2014 died in a fire that they started together.",
      "\u201cIt was a complete shock,\u201d actor Shubham Maheshwari, who plays Gat, told TODAY.com. \u201cIn all the directions the story could have gone, it just completely made me a fool.\u201d",
      "Though the series is adapted from E. Lockhart\u2019s bestselling young-adult book published in 2014, Maheshwari and his co-star Emily Alyn Lind, who plays Cadence, read the novel while auditioning.",
      "\u201cWhile I was reading the book, I didn\u2019t see it coming at all,\u201d Maheshwari said. \u201cI think, or at least I hope, that the show kind of does that, too.\u201d",
      "So what actually happened with the fire, and how did Cadence come to remember it? Here\u2019s how the ending of \u201cWe Were Liars\u201d went down.",
      "What Happens At the End of \u2018We Were Liars\u2019? The Twist, Explained",
      "In the final stretch of the series, viewers see Cadence piece together what happened to her two summers ago, when she experienced an accident \u2014 one she couldn\u2019t remember \u2014 on her family\u2019s private island off the coast of Massachusetts.",
      "In the penultimate episode, the timeline from two summers ago shows Cadence and the Liars around a fire, sifting through her grandfather\u2019s will and the ways he\u2019ll be distributing his wealth when he\u2019s gone. Cadence then ponders a world where the \u201cpetty, material\u201d things tearing the Sinclair family apart were just \u2026 gone. Cut to present-day Cadence, as the rest of the memory becomes clear to her.",
      "\u201cThere was a fire,\u201d she tells Mirren and Johnny. \u201cWe burned this place to the ground.\u201d",
      "The finale shows viewers what happened: Cadence, in a drunken stupor with the rest of the Liars, suggests they gas up every part of the house with fuel from the boathouse, light a match and get out of there. So they do just that \u2014 but the fire moves quicker than the Liars. Mirren and Johnny are trapped, Gat goes in to save them, and only Cadence escapes. Just when she realizes none of them made it out, the house\u2019s gas line explodes, sending Cadence cascading into the ocean.",
      "And all that time in the present day when Cadence was conversing with Gat and her cousins \u2014 it was in her head. She\u2019s no longer simply a privileged teenager on a summer getaway; she\u2019s a girl haunted by guilt.",
      "Series creators Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie said they leaned into both the mystery and emotional fallout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d Plec told TODAY.com. \u201cCadence has this jarring event, this terrible thing that happened to her. \u2026 It makes her unable to understand her truth.\u201d",
      "And, despite their privilege, the Liars\u2019 choices are messy and real.",
      "\u201cYou start with characters that the audience is going to want to reject and hate just for existing,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cAnd then you have to give the audience a reason to stick around and to pull back the layers on their pain and their trauma.\u201d",
      "At the series\u2019 end, Cadence chooses to leave her family behind.",
      "\u201cLoyalty means doing one last thing to mourn \u2014 and also pay respect to her friends that are gone,\u201d Lind told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s the least that (Cadence) can do after everything that they have had to endure.\u201d",
      "As Cadence walks away from Beechwood Island, she\u2019s not free of guilt \u2014 but she is reclaiming her voice.",
      "Lind hinted that this isn\u2019t the end of Cadence\u2019s story: \u201cHer grandfather threatens her and says, \u2018If you do (leave), I will expose you for everything.\u2019 And she decides to do so anyway.\u201d",
      "Whatever comes next, \u201cWe Were Liars\u201d ends its first season on a chilling, cathartic note \u2014 where truth, memory and loss collide."

      "\u201cThe TV show has to open up the book. There are deeper stories for Cadence\u2019s friends, for her love interest and also for the moms,\u201d Lockhart tells TODAY.com.",
      "Lockhart says showrunners Julie Plec and Carina Adly Mackenzie hold onto \u201cthe feeling of the novel\u201d while also broadening it by creating two timelines. The series flips between a \u201cmagical summer where Cadence and Gat fall in love and she\u2019s in a place of innocence,\u201d according to Lockhart, and then her reality after she has a terrible accident.",
      "\u201cThat later timeline, everything is from Cadence\u2019s perspective. You can only see what she can see. But back in the memory section, it\u2019s a broader scope,\u201d Lockhart says.",

      "What is \u2018We Were Liars\u2019 About?",
      "The Sinclairs are what one might call rich rich. And every summer, three generations of Sinclairs come together on Beechwood Island, a fictional private island off the coast of Massachusetts.",
      "There\u2019s Grandad, who\u2019s widowed; his three daughters, Penny, Carrie and Bess, who are all separated from their husbands; and the seven kids between them. One of those children is Cadence.",
      "Cadence, along with Mirren and Johnny, her two older cousins, and Gat, the son of her aunt\u2019s boyfriend, make up what the family calls the Liars.",
      "In the beginning of the novel, we find out that Cadence and Gat fell in love when she was 14, despite Grandad\u2019s dislike of Gat and Gat\u2019s father due to their South Asian heritage.",
      "But the following summer, there was a tragic accident of some sort. While Cadence can\u2019t remember what happened that summer, she has migraines to show for what must have been a terrible ordeal that left her with a severe head injury.",
      "The summer after her accident, Cadence\u2019s father decides to take her on a trip to Europe, where she writes to the Liars repeatedly, but receives no reply. Frustrated with her inability to remember what happened two summers ago and even more frustrated with her cousins for ignoring her emails, Cadence insists on spending \u201csummer 17\u201d on the island. Reluctantly, her parents agree to let her spend the first month of summer on Beechwood Island with the rest of her family, but it\u2019s clear that a lot has changed since she\u2019s last been on the compound.",
      "For one, the old Victorian house where Grandad and Granny used to live has been entirely rebuilt. Additionally, her first interactions with her aunts and cousins are awkward.",
      "The only thing that is seemingly normal about this summer is that her relationships with the Liars feel like no time has passed. And the bunch agree that this summer, they\u2019ll distance themselves from the rest of the family and just stick together. Over the course of her time on the island, Cadence\u2019s begins to remember what happened two summers ago \u2014 and it\u2019s more horrible than anyone could have imagined.",
      "What Happens at the End of 'We Were Liars'?",
      "As memories come back to Cadence in bits and pieces, no one is willing to help her stitch together the full picture. Whenever she asks anyone about what happened on the island two years ago, including the Liars, she gets nothing but empty half answers.",
      "But suddenly, it all starts coming back.",
      "The same summer as the accident, Cadence recalls Grandad and his three daughters arguing about the family home in Boston. Also, one of her aunts was very unhappy about the condition of her home on the island.",
      "Toward the end of the novel, the memories begin to rush in for Cadence. There had been an ugly family spat over Grandad\u2019s inheritance, with his three daughters all vying for the best portion. With tensions high, Grandad and the aunts all leave the island to cool off, and the Liars decide to take matters into their own hands,",
      "Fed up with their parents\u2019 and Grandad\u2019s fighting, the Liars, while intoxicated, set fire to the home thinking that if no one could inherit it, then they\u2019d ease the family\u2019s financial tensions.",
      "But something went terribly wrong \u2014 and Cadence was partially responsible. As the other Liars poured gasoline all over the house, Cadence threw a lit match on the floor while they were still inside. The entire ground floor of the home caught fire before the other three Liars and the two family dogs could escape, making Cadence the lone survivor of the accident.",
      "Finally, Cadence remembers in her own time what occurred two summers ago. Back then, her doctors advised her parents to let her remember the incident on her own, because when anyone reminded her of it, she would spiral into emotional turmoil, which no doubt contributed to her migraines.",
      "As for her interactions with the Liars all summer? Cadence had been seeing them as ghosts because her subconscious wasn\u2019t yet ready to let them go.",
      "In the end, at one of the homes on the island, affectionately named Cuddletown, Cadence says her final goodbye to the Liars, whose spirits she finally lays to rest."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:00:22 GMT",
    "summary": "If Trump bombs Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, the main risk would be from the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb itself rather than radiation or chemicals.",
    "story": [
      "If President Donald Trump does decide to use the United States' largest conventional bomb to destroy Iran\u2019s fortresslike Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, the colossal force of the explosion would likely cause casualties among workers or anyone else still at the site.",
      "But it would not trigger a nuclear explosion or a widespread radiological or chemical spill, according to former nuclear officials and experts.",
      "Sitting to the south of Iran's capital, Tehran, the Fordo plant is used to enrich uranium for the production of nuclear energy or, potentially, a bomb. But although this uranium and its chemical byproducts can be harmful to ingest or touch without protective equipment \u2014 they won\u2019t create a wider blast or regional contamination, analysts say.",
      "That would only be the case if Fordo housed nuclear reactors or warheads, which international watchdogs and experts say is not the case.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re down there and it gets bombed, you\u2019re stuffed,\u201d Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the ex-commanding officer of the British military\u2019s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s because this is a 2,500-kilogram (about 5,500-pound) warhead we are talking about here,\u201d he said, referring to the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (or MOP), the largest non-nuclear bomb in the world, which only the U.S. has.",
      "Less of a bunker-buster and more of a mountain-buster, this is perhaps the only conventional ordnance in the world that could do the job if Trump did decide to bomb Fordo.",
      "\u201cBut if anyone thinks this would be like Chernobyl \u2014 absolutely not,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said. \u201cBlowing up uranium will not create a nuclear explosion; that is a very complex piece of science, which is why it\u2019s so bloody difficult to make nuclear bombs.\u201d",
      "There is also little chance of a wider radiation leak or spill impacting the surrounding area, according to Mark Nelson, founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, a research consultancy based in Chicago.",
      "That\u2019s because \u201cthe nuclear substances at Fordo are only very weakly radioactive,\u201d he said. Were this a nuclear plant or missile site, there could be \u201cfission products\u201d \u2014 the stuff uranium breaks down into during a nuclear reaction \u2014 which can cause a wider catastrophe.",
      "Scrutiny has nonetheless sharpened on Fordo as Trump deliberates whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced enrichment facility, Fordo was refining uranium to 60%, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\u2019s far more than the 3-5% needed for power plants \u2014 and far closer to the 90% required to build a warhead.",
      "Until 2018, Iran had been complying with a landmark deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program.",
      "The agreement was sealed by President Barack Obama in July 2015, along with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union. Most independent observers said it was successfully limiting Iran's nuclear program.",
      "That effectively collapsed when Trump walked away from the pact three years later.",
      "Iran had been back in talks with Trump when Israel started bombing last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had no choice because Iran was racing toward building a bomb, something the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has not been able to confirm.",
      "The watchdog has been nonetheless concerned about Fordo, where uranium\u2019s naturally mined form is turned into a gas and spun at high speed inside centrifuges. That separates its heavier isotope, uranium-238, from the lighter uranium-235 that can be used for civilian purposes or otherwise.",
      "Iran says Fordo was designed to hold 3,000 of these centrifuges, a \u201csize and configuration\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with a peaceful program,\u201d Obama said in 2009.",
      "Observers such as de Bretton-Gordon say the U.S.\u2019s enormous MOP bomb might be powerful enough not only to destroy this facility but effectively incase it under the collapsed mountain. That could produce a similar effect to the sarcophagus built around Chernobyl after the disaster in 1986, Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Whereas Chernobyl\u2019s protective enclosure is 40 feet thick, \u201cat Fordo we would be talking about a sarcophagus 200-feet thick,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the risk of contamination would be zero.",
      "If the uranium gas is released, it would partly decompose into hydrofluoric acid, a deadly substance that causes deep-tissue burns if touched without protective gear, and potentially fatal problems for the heart, lungs and nervous system if inhaled.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty chemical to be around without correct safety equipment and procedures,\u201d said Nelson at the Radiant Energy Group. Any blast survivors, or rescuers without the necessary safety equipment, would face \u201cextremely severe\u201d consequences, he said, but caveated that \u201cyou have to be really close and really unprotected.\u201d",
      "There is also a chance that radioactive material could seep into any water source that\u2019s running through the mountain. But the likely radioactive levels would be low \u2014 detectable rather than harmful \u2014 both Nelson and de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Ultimately, Nelson agreed, all of these risks pale in comparison with the threat posed by the MOP bomb itself, whose payload is upward of 5,500 pounds and weighs a total of 30,000 pounds.",
      "\u201cThe danger at the seaside of saltwater ingestion is real \u2014 even a few liters could kill you,\u201d he analogized. \u201cThis danger, however, is relatively small compared to drowning.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thousands of supporters of Myanmar\u2019s jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi celebrated her 80th birthday Thursday by attempting to set a world record for the most birthday greeting videos, while others took to the streets in demonstrations against the military government that ousted her.",
      "Kalo Say Htoo, an organizer of the birthday video campaign, said the original goal was to collect 80,000 greeting videos to honor Suu Kyi and achieve a recognized Guinness World Record.",
      "The number of videos collected surpassed 103,000 on Thursday, tripling the current record of 32,207 achieved in 2017, organizers said.",
      "Suu Kyi was arrested in February 2021 when the military seized power from her democratically elected government. She was convicted on more than a dozen charges for offenses that her supporters say were concocted to keep her out of politics. She remains regarded by many in Myanmar as the country\u2019s legitimate leader while serving a 27-year prison term.",
      "Kim Aris, Suu Kyi\u2019s son living in London, said in a statement on Facebook Thursday that the campaign is a powerful testament to his mother\u2019s global support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my hope this achievement brings urgent attention to her plight and that of the people of Burma,\u201d said Aris, using the country\u2019s former name. \u201cHer voice may be silenced, but her flame will never be extinguished.\u201d",
      "Aris planned to run 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) to honor his mother\u2019s birthday, while encouraging others to show support with the numerical theme, such as walking for 80 minutes or making 80 recipes.",
      "More than 6,800 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces during a widespread armed struggle against military rule that began after generals seized power from Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Pro-democracy street protests in Suu Kyi\u2019s honor were held Thursday in areas that are not under military control including northern Kachin state, the central regions of Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway and in Tanintharyi in the south.",
      "Photos on social media showed demonstrators carrying flowers, birthday cakes and posters of Suu Kyi, as well as banners reading \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and urging supporters to strive for \u201cthe liberation of the entire nation, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201d",
      "The military government\u2019s supporters posted calls for the arrest of protesters.",
      "Several Western embassies posted pictures and illustrations on social media of red roses, with some issuing statements calling for Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners to be released.",
      "The Suu Foundation, a nonprofit humanitarian organization, and the law firm Zimeray & Finelle said in a joint statement Thursday that Suu Kyi was thought to have suffered an injury to her left arm during the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit the country in March."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program has not changed since March, when the director of national intelligence told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building an atomic bomb, according to the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Comments by President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have painted a different picture, suggesting that Iran is racing toward creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that Iran was \u201ca few weeks\u201d from having a nuclear weapon, and Netanyahu said in a recent interview that Iran was pursuing a \u201csecret plan\u201d to build a bomb within months.",
      "\u201cThe intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear, was absolutely clear that they were working on a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,\u201d Netanyahu recently told Fox News. \u201cThey were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.\u201d",
      "U.S. intelligence reporting on Israel is typically based in part on information provided by Israel\u2019s intelligence services. It was unclear whether Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were based on a different interpretation of the same intelligence.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters he was perplexed by Trump's assertions as lawmakers have received a different picture from U.S. intelligence officials.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies assessed that Iran had not made a decision to build nuclear weapons but that it had stockpiles of enriched uranium far beyond what is required for civilian purposes. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since her testimony, the source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Warner said Wednesday that he received further confirmation of the March intelligence assessment \u201cthis week.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Trump publicly dismissed Gabbard\u2019s testimony, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said.\u201d",
      "Warner said the administration needed to clarify whether there was new intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "\u201cSo far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon. They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it\u2019s based upon fact and not political influence,\u201d he said.",
      "Building the bomb",
      "For Iran to acquire a nuclear arsenal, it would need to enrich uranium to 90% purity. At the moment, it has a significant amount of uranium enriched to 60%, about 400 kilograms\u2019 worth, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "It would take a small technical step to enrich to 90%. Iran has enough uranium now to produce up to 10 weapons over several weeks, according to U.S. officials\u2019 estimates.",
      "But enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels is only the first step. Then Iran would have to build and test a device that could be delivered in the form of a bomb or a missile. Estimates vary, but Western officials and analysts say it could take months to more than a year to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Weapons experts say that Iran is not weeks away from securing a nuclear weapon but that it is weeks away from securing enough fissile material for an eventual weapon.",
      "The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said in a report this month that \u201cIran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60 percent.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Grossi told CNN said that U.N. inspectors did not have proof that Iran was engaged in \u201ca systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s airstrikes on Iran have probably set the country\u2019s nuclear program back by a few months, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Since it launched its campaign against Iran last week, Israel has bombed centrifuge plants used to enrich uranium, including a site at Natanz, south of Tehran, and labs used to convert uranium gas into a metal, according to the IAEA and Israeli officials.",
      "Israel says it has killed several nuclear scientists and targeted missile launch and storage sites in its air raids."

    "story": [
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand has halted millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands over the \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of agreements the smaller Pacific nation made with China, officials from the New Zealand Foreign Minister\u2019s office said Thursday.",
      "New Zealand, which is the smaller Pacific nation\u2019s biggest funder, won\u2019t consider any new money for the Cook Islands until the relationship improves, a spokesperson for Foreign Minister Winston Peters told The Associated Press. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown told lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday that the funding was \u201cnot halted, it\u2019s paused,\u201d and downplayed the significance of the amount frozen.",
      "Relations between other Pacific islands and their larger regional backers Australia and New Zealand have stumbled over ties with China in recent years as Beijing has vied to increase its Pacific sway. But the latest move by New Zealand\u2019s government was striking because it reflected growing friction between two countries with strong constitutional ties \u2014 Cook Islands is self-governing but shares a military and passports with New Zealand \u2014 over their diverging approaches to managing relations with Beijing.",
      "News of the 18.2 million New Zealand dollar ($11 million) funding halt Thursday only emerged when a Cook Islands news outlet saw its brief mention in a government budget document. It is likely to prove difficult for New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is in China for his first official visit and due to meet President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "Beijing has defended its Cook Islands strategic partnership before, saying in February that the deals were not intended to antagonize New Zealand.",
      "In a report tabled in the Cook Islands Parliament this week, the Public Accounts Committee registered \u201cconcern\u201d about a reduction of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($6 million) in the government\u2019s purse, the first known mention of the finance freeze. The money was earmarked for \u201ccore sector support,\u201d which funds the Cook Islands\u2019 health, education and tourism sectors, with audits by Wellington on how it is spent.",
      "The money is part of NZ$200 million directed to the Cook Islands by New Zealand over the past three years as part of an almost 60-year-old free association compact. The links demand consultation by Cook Islands leaders with Wellington on agreements with other countries that might affect New Zealand.",
      "The pacts with China were the first serious test of those rules.",
      "The Cook Islands, population 15,000, has a large and lucrative exclusive economic zone, with Brown\u2019s government exploring prospects for deep sea mining activity. Cook Islanders can freely live and work in New Zealand, which prompted alarm about national security in Wellington when officials learned of the raft of agreements Brown signed in February.",
      "The agreements did not promise security cooperation between Beijing and the Cook Islands, but they did pledge more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Not all of the documents Brown signed were released publicly.",
      "The spokesperson for New Zealand Foreign Minister Peters said Thursday that the agreements illustrated \u201ca gap in understanding\u201d between the governments \u201cabout what our special relationship of free association requires,\u201d which included consultation to ensure the preservation of shared interests.",
      "The \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of the deals and lack of consultation with Wellington about them prompted a review of funding to the Cook Islands, Peters\u2019 office said.",
      "\u201cNew Zealand has therefore paused these payments and will also not consider significant new funding until the Cook Islands Government takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust,\u201d the spokesperson\u2019s statement said.",
      "Brown said in February that the deals did not \u201creplace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships.\u201d News of the agreements prompted protests in Avarua led by opposition lawmakers.",
      "On Thursday, Brown made a pointed reference in Parliament to Luxon\u2019s China visit, highlighting the New Zealand leader\u2019s announcements of increased trade with Beijing and looser visa requirements for Chinese travelers. The Cook Islands leader said he trusted any agreements Luxon made in Beijing would \u201cpose no security threat to the people of the Cook Islands\u201d despite Avarua not knowing their content.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s latest action was an \u201centirely avoidable consequence of Cook Islands\u2019 strategic flirtations with China,\u201d said Mihai Sora, an analyst with the Australia-based think tank Lowy Institute.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit cute to sign up to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2025 and pretend there is no strategic angle for Beijing, given all the mounting evidence of China\u2019s malign strategic intent in the Pacific,\u201d he said."

      "Trump called for Iran\u2019s \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d and wrote in a post on Truth Social that the U.S. has the ability to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\u201cHe is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\u201d Trump wrote shortly after declaring \u201ctotal control\u201d over Iranian airspace.",
      "Khamenei on Wednesday responded, threatening the U.S. with \u201cirreparable damage\u201d if Washington follows through with a military strike. \u201cThe damage they suffer will be far worse than anything Iran may face. If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from,\u201d the Iranian leader said, according to NBC News reporting.",
      "The rapidly escalating conflict, triggered by Israel\u2019s surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, has sent oil prices surging and put a region on edge. Initially encouraging of diplomatic talks with Tehran, Trump\u2019s statements have become increasingly threatening as populations across the Middle East brace for what comes next.",
      "But destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 which Tehran asserts is for civilian energy purposes only \u2014 is no easy feat.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced and hardened nuclear facility, the Fordo plant in the country\u2019s northwest, is a fortress.",
      "Built inside a mountain some 300 feet underground and reinforced by layers of concrete, the plant \u2014 which is the most likely target of a potential American strike \u2014 is impenetrable by any bomb except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The U.S. is the only country in the world that has this \u201cbunker buster\u201d weapon, as well as the only country with the aircraft capable of transporting and deploying it: the B2 Spirit stealth bomber.",
      "This is in part why Israel has been so eager for U.S. involvement in its offensive operations against Iran in addition to its defensive ones.",
      "But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.",
      "\u201cSo you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site\u201d and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cAnd then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you\u2019ve damaged,\u201d he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground.",
      "\u201cThis leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside,\u201d Des Roches told CNBC.",
      "Wider war for America?",
      "Iran\u2019s military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.",
      "Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world\u2019s most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil,\u201d said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThere are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign.\u201d",
      "Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a \u201cprofound psychological effect on the Iranians,\u201d he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country.",
      "A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that \u2014 something Israel\u2019s government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.",
      "\u201cI think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon,\u201d Des Roches argued.",
      "If Fordo remains operational, Israel\u2019s attacks would barely slow Iran\u2019s ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic\u2019s regime as a whole.",
      "Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that \u201cIran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program,\u201d even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy,\u201d Vaez told CNBC. \u201cTrump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won\u2019t be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired.\u201d"
