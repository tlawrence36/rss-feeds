      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Brian Tyree Henry's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood",
      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "The Clown Circle project in Rio offers weekly activities, creating themed performances around calendar events like Carnival.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",
      "Kebede had already gone through an emotional wringer by the time the curtain finally came down. She sings the Act 1 showstopper \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d shooting into the air and the power of the moment ripped through her.",
      "\u201cWhen the lights went off at the end of the song, I started sobbing. Not like just a gentle tear. Viscerally, I had to release,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cIf I\u2019m flying solo/At least I\u2019m flying free/To those who ground me, take a message back from me/Tell them how I am defying gravity,\u201d she sang.",
      "\u201cEveryone deserves a chance to fly,\u201d says Kebede. \u201cI'm projecting this message that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you deserve liberation and you deserve empowerment in the way that the character feels in that moment. It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",

      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cThe rigorous nature of touring, I think, prepared me immensely for this,\u201d she says. \u201cI do feel very equipped \u2014 physically, vocally, emotionally. I feel like I know how to take care of my body and my mind, how I need to cool down emotionally after such an intense experience for three hours.\u201d",

      "Family came backstage after the show for photos and a tour, she was toasted at a nearby bar by friends, she finally ate something and then got home to try to sleep.",

      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "",
      "Taken together, experts have raised concerns about a possible misinterpretation of Kennedy's message: that because vitamin A is available, they don't need to be vaccinated.",
      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "Indeed, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is \"one of the most effective and durable vaccines that we have,\" she said, with the full two-dose series being 97% effective against measles.",
      "",
      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",
      "",
      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",
      "",
      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months",
      "",
      "\"Again, if a child has measles, that vitamin A should be prescribed under the supervision of the physician to make sure that it is dosed appropriately,\" Hayes said.",
      "",
      "Still, both Hayes and Tan emphasized that vaccination is the only way to stop more measles outbreaks like the current one in west Texas, where 159 cases have been identified since late January, with 22 hospitalizations and one death  --  the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.",
      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",
      "",
      "\"If we cannot get our vaccination rates up to where they were, we're going to continue to see these outbreaks,\" she added, and that could mean more deaths, as it's estimated that one to three children in 1,000 with measles will die.",
      "",
      "Measles can also cause complications after the initial illness has passed, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  --  a rare, though fatal, neurologic disease  --  and immunodeficiency, Hayes said.",
      "",
      "\"I always find measles extremely concerning because it is so contagious,\" Hayes said. There are \"so many individuals in this country who are not immune,\" such as infants under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated yet, and individuals who are immunocompromised, she added. And there is a \"risk for very severe disease as well as complications  --  both acute complications as well as long-term complications  --  with this virus.\""

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "The Solong was drifting and still on fire Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.",
      "The 183-meter (596-foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government\u2019s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed.",
      "The collision sent jet fuel pouring into the sea and sparked fears of significant environmental damage. Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.",
      "Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace expressed hope that the impact on local marine life may not be as bad as first feared.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it\u2019s starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,\" said Dr. Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories. \u201cWhen a container ship the length of a football pitch rams into a tanker carrying thousands of tons of jet fuel at 16 knots close to sensitive nature sites, the potential for serious harm is huge.\u201d",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Archaeologists in Cambodia are celebrating an unexpected find at the country\u2019s centuries-old Angkor temple complex: the torso of a statue of Buddha that matches a head found nearly a century ago at the same site.",
      "The torso, believed to be from the 12th or 13th century, was discovered during a dig by a team of Cambodian and Indian experts last month at Angkor\u2019s Ta Prohm temple. It was found along with 29 fragments that appeared to be part of the same statue, archaeologist Neth Simon said this week.",
      "It stands at 1.16 meters (3 3/4 feet) tall and is in the Bayon art style, associated with Angkor\u2019s Bayon temple.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise when we unearthed this sculpture because all we\u2019d found so far were small pieces,\u201d Neth Simon told The Associated Press by phone from Siem Reap province.",
      "She described the statue\u2019s design as displaying carved jewelry and robe and sash, with a unique left-hand gesture across the chest \u2014 \u201can uncommon representation in Khmer (Cambodian) art.\u201d",
      "The statue\u2019s presumed head was discovered at the same temple in 1927 during the French colonial era, and is currently kept at Cambodia\u2019s main National Museum in the capital Phnom Penh. Neth Simon said the torso was found about 50 meters (yards) away from the site where the head was discovered, and that an optical electronic scan confirmed they were a match.",
      "A near-complete reconstruction of the status is possible, Neth Simon added, now that only the right hand of the statue remains missing. Her team will ask the Minister of Culture and Fine Art for approval to reattach the head and body of the sculpture to make it whole for public display.",
      "The Angkor site sprawls across some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia.",
      "The site is Cambodia\u2019s most popular tourist attraction and in 2024 attracted about a million international tourists, according to Cambodia\u2019s Tourism Ministry.",
      "The excavations aim to organize and preserve the numerous art objects scattered throughout the Ta Prohm complex, highlighting the ongoing efforts to protect and understand Cambodia\u2019s rich cultural heritage, the Apsara Authority says.",
      "Neth Simon said she would be delighted if the statue\u2019s pieces could be reassembled after being far apart from each other for a century.",
      "\u201cAs an archaeologist, I would be really happy,\" she said."

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Lawmakers in South Africa laid out plans to shore up the budgets for health and defense but also put up value added tax by 0.5%, a move that will raise the cost of living as consumers pay more for goods, including food, and services.",
      "An additional 28.9 billion rand ($1.5 billion) was earmarked for health spending in the 2025 budget, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said, as the country scrambles to make up for cuts to aid from the U.S. under the Trump administration.",
      "The extra money will pay the salaries of roughly 9,300 medical personnel in clinics and hospitals and about 800 newly qualified doctors.",
      "Health spending overall is expected to grow from 277 billion rand in 2024/25 to 329 billion rand in 2027/28.",
      "The increase comes amid concerns that South Africa\u2019s health system, which cares for the world\u2019s largest HIV population and has 5.5 million people on life-saving antiretroviral drugs, will be strained by cuts to USAID, the U.S. agency for international development.",
      "In early February, President Donald Trump cancelled PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which provides over $400 million annually to South Africa\u2019s HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Although 74% of South Africa\u2019s HIV response is funded domestically, some services depend on U.S. government funding, which makes up around 17% of the nation\u2019s AIDS response budget.",
      "Despite South Africa being one of Africa\u2019s most developed nations, it struggles with high debt rates and slow GDP growth.",
      "The health ministry will shortly begin consultations on how to divide up state funds, including allocations to fill the gaps left by the U.S. cuts, ministry spokesperson Foster Mohale said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell you how we are going to assist those affected by the funding freeze,\u201d said Mohale. \"But we\u2019ll be able to communicate (soon) how we\u2019re going to use this budget to try to cover some pressure areas.\u201d",
      "The latest budget has not yet been approved by the cabinet. Parliamentary committees will debate the budget in the coming weeks before putting it to a vote before the full legislature. If it passes, the ministries are free to use the funds as allocated. However, if Parliament rejects it, new elections are convened, and the administration resigns.",
      "Some 5 billion rand ($271 million) was ringfenced to beef up military forces, said Godongwana, reaffirming South Africa's commitment to peacekeeping in the region as fighting intensifies in eastern Congo.",
      "To fund additional spending on health, education, transportation and security, the government plans to raise the consumption tax, or VAT, by half a percentage point in 2025\u20132026, sparking outrage from political and civic organizations.",
      "VAT is payable on goods and services including food and electricity.",
      "Another half a percentage point will be introduced in the following year, putting the rate of VAT at 16% by 2026\u20132027.",
      "\u201cVAT is a tax that affects everyone. By opting for a marginal increase to VAT, its distributional effect and impact were cautiously considered,\u201d said the finance minister, attempting to fend off jeers from lawmakers. \u201cThe increase is also the most effective way to avoid further spending cuts and to enable us to extend the social wage.\u201d"

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An Emirati diplomat earlier identified by Tehran as carrying a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to jump-start talks over Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program met Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister in the Iranian capital.",
      "It is unclear how Iran will react to the letter, which Trump revealed during a television interview last week. Its intended recipient, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said he's not interested in talks with a \u201cbullying government.\u201d",
      "But Iran struggles with economic woes exacerbated by U.S. and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, and Trump has imposed more since he took office in January. That pressure, coupled with internal turmoil in Iran and recent direct attacks by Israel, has put Tehran in one of the most precarious positions its theocracy has faced since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "\u201cAmerica threatens with military action, but in my opinion, this threat is irrational,\u201d Khamenei said earlier Wednesday. \u201cIran is capable of delivering a reciprocal blow, and it will certainly do so.\u201d",
      "Iranian state television showed Emirati official Anwar Gargash meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Tehran. Gargash's visit had not been previously announced. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman earlier said he'd be carrying the letter from Trump. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, maintains close ties with the United States.",
      "The brief footage shot before the meeting did not show the letter. Gargash and the UAE government did not immediately acknowledge his trip during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.",
      "Trump last week acknowledged writing a letter to the 85-year-old Khamenei.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve written them a letter saying, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing,'\u201d Trump said in the interview.",
      "Trump has offered no details on what, if anything, was specifically offered to Iran in the letter.",
      "The move recalled Trump\u2019s letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings but no deals to limit Pyongyang\u2019s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.",
      "The last time Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort. Abe ended up slipping the envelope under his leg in footage widely shared by Iranian state media to this day.",
      "On Wednesday before Gargash's arrival, Khamenei spoke to students during a ceremony in Tehran and called Trump's letter \"an attempt to deceive global public opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis person tore apart and threw out of the window finished and completed, and signed, talks,\" Khamenei said. \u201cHow could one possibly negotiate with such a person?\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf we wanted to build a nuclear weapon, America couldn\u2019t stop us.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s overture comes as Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel and Iran have traded direct attacks during the Israel-Hamas war, while partners in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d are reeling after the assassinations of their leaders by Israel. In Israel, officials have suggested striking Iran\u2019s nuclear program now, something Trump has threatened while insisting he\u2019d prefer reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran.",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has said Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report last month by the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran\u2019s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran\u2019s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",
      "It is unclear how Iran will handle further pressure. The Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, has dramatically fallen in value. Unemployment and underemployment are rampant. Meanwhile, women have continued their defiance of laws on the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, and go without the head covering, two years after the death of a detained young woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked nationwide protests.",

      "The recent Bosnian Serb moves are seen as part of escalating efforts to break the territory away from Bosnia and have been condemned by the United States and the European Union. Dodik, who has faced U.S. and Bristish sanctions, is backed by Moscow.",
      "The assembly of Republika Srpska on Wednesday debated a new draft constitution that would advance the separation process even further by establishing its own army and allowing the entity to join a union with neighboring countries.",

      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",

      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "The warning from the Houthis again throws into chaos a crucial maritime waterway between Asia and Europe, threatens revenue from Egypt's Suez Canal and possibly will halt aid shipments to war zones. The rebels in the past have also had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",
      "The statement from the Houthis' Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center follows a four-day deadline set by the rebels for Israel to resume aid shipments.",
      "\u201cWe hope it is understood that the actions taken by the (Houthi military) ... stem from a deep sense of religious, humanitarian and moral responsibility toward the oppressed Palestinian people and aim to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies,\u201d the statement said.",
      "It described the warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",
      "The statement added: \u201cAny Israeli vessel attempting to violate this ban will be subject to military targeting in the declared operational area.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate sign of an attack on ships. Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israel earlier this month halted all aid coming into the Gaza Strip and has warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for Hamas if the fragile ceasefire in the war isn\u2019t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase of the pause in fighting. The move drew intense international criticism as even before the war the over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza relied on international aid, something that's only intensified after a grinding Israeli military offensive destroyed the enclave.",
      "The maritime security firm Ambrey warned the statements from the Houthis were \u201cambiguous,\u201d likely putting more ships at risk.",
      "It's \u201clikely to have extended once more toward ships partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels managed and/or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel,\u201d the firm said.",
      "There was no direct threat made against the U.S. Navy, whose Bahrain-based 5th Fleet patrols the Mideast. However, the earlier Houthi campaign saw American and Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most-serious combat the Navy had seen since World War II.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other ships associated with its carrier group are operating in the Red Sea now. The U.S. military said Wednesday that its forces in the region \u201cremain vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do what is necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel, assets and partners,\u201d it said.",
      "The rebels\u2019 secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn\u2019t let aid into Gaza. That deadline passed Tuesday.",
      "The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation."

      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it\u2019s important not to \u201cget ahead\u201d of the question of responding to the ceasefire proposal. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting \u201cdetailed information\u201d about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position.",

The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that\u2019s has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.",
      "The American military help is vital for Ukraine\u2019s shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia\u2019s bigger military force at bay.

      "His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations.",

      "Inside Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday,",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting.",
      "Rubio, who led the American delegation to Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and hasn't accepted any concessions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to tell (the Russians) this is what\u2019s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it\u2019ll be up to them to say yes or no,\u201d Rubio told reporters after the talks. \u201cIf they say no, then we\u2019ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.\u201d",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was being flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday to face an International Criminal Court charge of crimes against humanity linked to the deadly crackdown on drugs he oversaw while in office.",
      "The 79-year-old Duterte\u2019s arrest Tuesday on a warrant issued by the global court was hailed by human rights groups and families of victims as a major breakthrough and step toward ending impunity.",
      "Flight tracking data showed that after leaving Manila, the jet carrying Duterte waited for hours in Dubai before taking off again, apparently headed for Rotterdam The Hague Airport. The court didn't immediately comment on the flight, but Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Tuesday that police arrested Duterte when he returned from a trip to Hong Kong and sent him to the ICC.",
      "When he arrives in the Netherlands, he will be taken to the court's detention unit inside a Dutch prison complex near the North Sea coast.",
      "Rights groups and families of victims welcomed the arrest.",
      "\u201cThis is a monumental and long-overdue step for justice for thousands of victims and their families,\" said Jerrie Abella of Amnesty International.",
      "\"It is therefore a hopeful sign for them, as well, in the Philippines and beyond, as it shows that suspected perpetrators of the worst crimes, including government leaders, will face justice wherever they are in the world,\u201d Abella added.",
      "Emily Soriano, the mother of a victim of the crackdowns, said she wanted more officials to face justice.",
      "\"Duterte is lucky he has due process, but our children who were killed did not have due process,\u201d she said.",
      "Duterte's supporters, however, criticized his arrest as illegal and sought to have him returned home. Small groups of Duterte supporters and people who backed his arrest demonstrated on Wednesday outside the court before his arrival.",
      "The ICC opened an inquiry in 2021 into mass killings linked to the so-called war on drugs overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president.",
      "Estimates of the death toll during Duterte\u2019s presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups.",
      "ICC judges who looked at prosecution evidence supporting their request for his arrest found \u201creasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Duterte is individually responsible for the crime against humanity of murder\u201d as an \u201cindirect co-perpetrator for having allegedly overseen the killings when he was mayor of Davao and later president of the Philippines,\" according to his warrant.",
      "Within days of being taken into custody at the court's detention center, Duterte will be taken to court for a hearing. Judges will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing known as a confirmation of charges at which a panel of pretrial judges will assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to merit sending him to a full trial.",
      "Duterte could challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case. While the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC, the alleged crimes happened before Manila withdrew from the court.",
      "That process will likely take months and if the case progresses to trial it could take years. Duterte will be able to apply for provisional release from the court\u2019s detention center while he waits, though it's up to judges to decide whether to grant such a request.",
      "Duterte's legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, told reporters in Manila that the Philippine Supreme Court \"can compel the government to bring back the person arrested and detained without probable cause and compel the government bring him before the court and to explain to them why they (government) did what they did.\u201d",
      "Marcos said Tuesday that Duterte\u2019s arrest was \u201cproper and correct\u201d and not an act of political persecution.",
      "Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court, which she said currently has no jurisdiction in the Philippines.",
      "She left the Philippines on Wednesday to arrange a meeting in The Hague with her detained father and talk to his lawyers, her office told reporters in Manila.",
      "Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the ICC, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing that the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 therefore didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC rejected those arguments and ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume.",
      "The ICC judges who issued the warrant also said that the alleged crimes fall within the court's jurisdiction. They said Duterte\u2019s arrest was necessary because of what they called the \u201crisk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims.\u201d",

      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",
      "\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it\u2019s important not to \u201cget ahead\u201d of the question of responding to the ceasefire proposal. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting \u201cdetailed information\u201d about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position.",

      "His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press.

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense trans-Atlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth around 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. Yet the tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which is also on the list.",
      "Spirits producers have in essence become collateral damage in the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move \u201cis deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,\u201d said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended.",

      "Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.",

First on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls \u201crebalancing measures,\u201d which the EU had from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.",

    "story": [
      "A lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says the agency needs to seek a trial delay in a case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges",
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\u201cOur resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\u201d Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\u201d",
      "When the judge asked if the agency\u2019s challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \u201cFork in the road\u201d email sent by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \u201cmove the trial back more than a couple of months,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \u201cracing at considerable cost\u201d to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \u201can abandoned USAID facility,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \u201cthings are going to be different in two months\u201d with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \u201ccannot guarantee if things won\u2019t be even worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\u201d he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president. The company is also working on a documentary that offers an \u201cunprecedented behind-the-scenes look\u201d into the life of first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos has made changes to The Washington Post, which he owns, that some critics have cast as favorable to Trump.",
      "Before the election, Bezos defended the newspaper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cprincipled.\u201d He rejected speculation that he ordered the non-endorsement to protect his business interests.",

      "The Republican president's use of tariffs to extract concessions from other nations points toward a possibly destructive trade war and a stark change in America\u2019s approach to global leadership. It also has destabilized the stock market and stoked anxiety about an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take back our wealth, and we\u2019re going to take back a lot of the companies that left.\u201d",
      "Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \u201creciprocal\u201d rates starting on April 2.",
      "The EU announced its own countermeasures on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was \u201capplying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d or about $28 billion. Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect on April 1.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded by saying that the EU was punishing America instead of fixing what he viewed as excess capacity in steel and aluminum production.",
      "\u201cThe EU\u2019s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States \u2013 and indeed international security \u2013 and is yet another indicator that the EU\u2019s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Meeting on Wednesday with Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump said \u201cof course\u201d he wants to respond to EU's retaliations and \u201cof course\u201d Ireland is taking advantage of the United States.",
      "\u201cThe EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canada sees itself as locked in a trade war under the pretext that its center for fentanyl smuggling and that its natural resources and factories subtract from the U.S. economy instead of supporting it.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a day to day fight. This is now the second round of unjustified tariffs leveled against Canada,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's foreign affairs minister. \u201cThe latest excuse is national security despite the fact that Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum adds to America\u2019s security. All the while there is a threat of further and broader tariffs on April 2 still looming. The excuse for those tariffs shifts every day.\u201d",
      "Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States and plans to impose retaliatory tariffs of Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) starting Thursday in response to the U.S. taxes on the metals.",
      "Canada's new tariffs would be on steel and aluminum products, as well as U.S. goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion). That's in addition to the 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump import taxes that he\u2019s partially delayed by a month.",
      "Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable a day earlier that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\u201cThe higher it goes, the more likely it is they\u2019re going to build,\u201d Trump told the group. \u201cThe biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That\u2019s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\u201d",
      "Trump on Tuesday had threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but he chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Democratic lawmakers dismissed Trump's claims that his tariffs are about national security and drug smuggling, saying they're actually about generating revenues to help cover the cost of his planned income tax cuts for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump knows his policies could wreck the economy, but he\u2019s doing it anyway,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cWhy are they doing all these crazy things that Americans don\u2019t like? One reason, and one reason alone: tax breaks for billionaires, the north star of the Republican party\u2019s goals.",
      "In many ways, the president is addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Outside forecasts by the Yale University Budget Lab, Tax Policy Center and others suggest that U.S. families would have the costs of the taxes passed onto them in the form of higher prices.",
      "With Wednesday's tariffs on steel and aluminum, Trump is seeking to remedy his original 2018 import taxes that were eroded by exemptions.",
      "After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn\u2019t find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the United States, they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials.",
      "Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase to their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it\u2019s the time to expand that assembly line?\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "The top steel exporters to the U.S. are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and Japan, with exports from Taiwan and Vietnam growing at a fast pace, according to the International Trade Administration. Imports from China, the world's largest steel producer, account for only a small fraction of what the U.S. buys.",
      "The lion's share of U.S. aluminum imports comes from Canada."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed disappointment over the decision of the Trump administration to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed disappointment Wednesday over the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports, and said a retaliatory response was possible.",
      "During his weekly questioning in the House of Commons, Starmer said his government was taking a \u201cpragmatic approach\" but \"we will keep all options on the table.\u201d",
      "Starmer, leader of the center-left Labour Party, said negotiations with the Trump administration over a bilateral trade deal were ongoing.",
      "Starmer was responding to a question from the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, who said the U.K. should be taking a \u201cmore robust\u201d approach with the U.S. president \u201clike the Europeans and like the Canadians.\u201d",
      "Britain is not part of the European Union, which Wednesday announced import taxes on American goods, ranging from steel and aluminum to bourbon, peanut butter and jeans in response to Trump\u2019s move.",
      "Starmer has worked to build strong ties with President Donald Trump, in hope of avoiding the tariffs levied on many other U.S. trading partners. After a meeting last month at the White House, Trump and Starmer said their governments would work on sealing a long-elusive U.S.-U.K. trade deal.",
      "The tariffs are a new blow for Britain\u2019s once-mighty steel industry, which has shrunk dramatically from its 1970s peak and now accounts for 0.1% of the economy. Thousands of jobs are due to be lost at the country\u2019s biggest steelworks, at Port Talbot in Wales, as owner Tata Steel tries to make the unprofitable plant leaner and greener.",
      "Trade body UK Steel said that in 2024, Britain exported 180,000 metric tons (198,000 U.S. tons) of steel to the United States, about 7% of the U.K.\u2019s total steel exports by volume and 9% by value. The aluminum industry says the U.S. market accounts for 10% of U.K. exports.",
      "Without pushing for an immediate retaliatory response, Unite, the U.K.\u2019s biggest union, said the government should use U.K.-produced steel in public sector projects.",
      "\u201cOur government must act decisively to protect the steel industry and its workers following the announcement of U.S. tariffs,\" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. \u201cThis is a matter of national security.\"",

      "Lawyers representing four Indonesian fishermen say they were beaten and trapped on vessels that were part of the global supply chain that provided tuna to Bumble Bee Seafoods",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lawyers representing four Indonesian fishermen who say they were beaten and trapped on vessels that were part of the global supply chain that provided tuna to Bumble Bee Seafoods filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the canned seafood giant.",
      "It is believed to be the first such case of forced labor at sea brought against a U.S. seafood company, the men\u2019s lawyer, Agnieszka Fryszman, said.",
      "U.S. companies that benefit from forced labor and undercut other businesses need to be held accountable, Fryszman said.",
      "\u201cWhat you see is really devastating,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the company headquartered in San Diego of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The law allows foreigners who suffered from human trafficking to sue U.S. businesses that knew or should have known that they were profiting from forced labor.",
      "Bumble Bee did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment.",
      "The fisherman are all from villages in Indonesia and worked for longline vessels owned by Chinese companies from which Bumble Bee sourced its albacore tuna, according to the lawsuit. They say they were beaten regularly by their captains.",
      "One fisherman named Akhmad, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said he was hit by a metal hook and forced to work even after being injured on the job by a load of fish that gashed open his leg to the bone. Another fisherman, Syafi\u2019i, said he received no medical care for severe burns and was ordered to return to work to pay to eat. All the men said they asked to go home and even tried to go on strike on board, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The boats stayed out at sea while supply ships provided provisions and collected the catch. The men were strapped with debt from food bills and other fees and the threat of fines if they quit, Fryszman said.",
      "Bumble Bee had been warned of inhumane conditions in its supply chain over the years. In 2020, accounts of abusive conditions and forced labor prompted the U.S. to halt imports from a Taiwan-based fishing vessel that reportedly supplied the global tuna trading company that acquired Bumble Bee Seafoods that same year. None of these fishermen worked on that vessel.",
      "The lawsuit seeks compensation for their unpaid wages and abuse, Fryszman said. The men are also seeking systemic changes, she said. For example, they want companies like Bumble Bee to require in their contracts that the vessels in their supply chain bring in their catch rather than remain out at sea, and have medical care on board and Wi-Fi service for workers to get help.",
      "The global fishing industry has been plagued by labor abuses for years, with workers subjected to brutal treatment often with little or no pay. Congress approved legislation providing the agency with additional authority to crack down on forced labor in 2016 after an Associated Press investigation found that seafood caught by slaves in Southeast Asia was ending up in restaurants and markets around the United States.",
      "In 2018, Fryszman represented two Indonesian fishermen who said they were enslaved on an American fishing boat. They settled their lawsuit for an undisclosed amount against the vessel\u2019s California-based owner seven years after escaping and receiving special U.S. visas as victims of human trafficking."

      "Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Trump has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested Tuesday the border is a fictional line.",
      "\"I am ready to sit down with President Trump at the appropriate time under a position where there is respect for Canadian sovereignty and we are working for a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney, who will be sworn in Friday with his new Cabinet, spoke to reporters at a steel factory in Hamilton, Ontario after Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%. Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S.",
      "Carney said workers in both countries will be better off when \"the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.\u201d",
      "He added he respects Trump's concerns for American workers and about fentanyl.",
      "\u201cToday is a difficult day for Canada and the industry because of these unjustified tariffs that have been put on,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Canada responded with its own countermeasures. It plans to impose retaliatory tariffs of 29.8 billion Canadian dollars ($20.7 billion) starting Thursday in response to the U.S. taxes on the metals. Canada\u2019s new tariffs would be on steel and aluminum products, as well as U.S. goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters worth CA$14.2 billion ($9.9 billion).",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this because we believe in open borders and free and fair trade but we are doing this in response,\" Carney said.",
      "Canada\u2019s new tariffs are in addition to its 25% counter tariffs on CA$30 billion ($20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump import taxes that he partially delayed by a month.",
      "Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said Wednesday this is now the second round of unjustified tariffs leveled against Canada.",
      "\u201cThe excuse for the first round was exaggerated claims about our border. We addressed all the concerns raised by the U.S.,\" Joly said.",
      "\u201cThe latest excuse is national security despite the fact that Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum adds to America\u2019s security. All the while there is a threat of further and broader tariffs on April 2 still looming.\u201d",
      "Joly said the excuses for those tariffs shift every day.",
      "\u201cThe only constant in this unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump\u2019s talk of annexing our country through economic coercion. Yesterday he called our a border a fictional line and repeated his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric,\u201d Joly said.",
      "The U.S. president has given a variety of explanations for his antagonism of Canada. He has said that his separate 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada, some of which have been suspended for a month, are about fentanyl smuggling and objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalize U.S. farmers. He also continued to call for Canada to become part of the United States.",
      "\u201cMr. Carney is a serious person, a serious man, and he\u2019ll engage only if there are serious talks,\u201d Joly said."

    "story": [
      "A more than 40-mile long conveyor belt filled with sand stretches from the oil fields of West Texas to New Mexico, all for the purpose of one mission: oil production",
      "KERMIT, Texas -- It's longer than the width of Rhode Island, snakes across the oil fields of the southwest U.S. and crawls at 10 mph \u2013 too slow for a truck and too long for a train.",
      "It's a new sight: the longest conveyer belt in America.",
      "Atlas Energy Solutions, a Texas-based oil field company, has installed a 42-mile long (67 kilometers) conveyer belt to transport millions of tons of sand for hydraulic fracturing. The belt the company named \u201cThe Dune Express\u201d runs from tiny Kermit, Texas, and across state borders into Lea County, New Mexico. Tall and lanky with lids that resemble solar modules, the steel structure could almost be mistaken for a roller coaster.",
      "In the remote West Texas, there are few people to marvel at the unusual machine in Kermit, a city with a population of less than 6,000, where the sand is typically hauled by tractor-trailers. During fracking, liquid is pumped into the ground at a high pressure to create holes, or fractures, that release oil. The sand helps keep the holes open as water, oil and gas flow through it.",
      "But moving the sand by truck is usually a long and potentially dangerous process, according to CEO John Turner. He said massive trucks moving sand and other industrial goods are a common site in the oil-rich Permian Basin and pose a danger to other drivers.",
      "\u201cPretty early on, the delivery of sand via truck was not only inefficient, it was dangerous,\u201d he said.",
      "The conveyor belt, with a freight capacity of 13 tons (11.79 metric tonnes), was designed to bypass and trudge alongside traffic.",
      "Innovation isn't new to the oil and gas industry, nor is the idea to use a conveyor belt to move materials around. Another conveyer belt believed to be the world\u2019s longest conveyor \u2014 at 61 miles (98.17 kilometers) long \u2014 carries phosphorous from a mine in Western Sahara on the northwest coast of Africa, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "When moving sand by truck became a nuisance, an unprecedented and risky investment opportunity arose: constructing a $400 million machine to streamline the production of hydraulic fracturing. The company went public in March 2023, in part, to help pay for the conveyor belt and completed its first delivery in January, Turner said.",
      "The sand sits in a tray-shaped pan with a lid that can be taken off at any point, but most of the it gets offloaded into silos near the Texas and New Mexico border. Along its miles-long journey, the sand is sold and sent to fracking companies who move it by truck for the remainder of the trip.",
      "Keeping the rollers on the belt aligned and making sure it runs smoothly are the biggest maintenance obstacles, according to Turner. The rollers are equipped with chips that signal when its about to fail and need to be replaced. This helps prevent wear and tear and keep the machine running consistently, Turner said.",
      "The belt cuts through a large oil patch where environmentalists have long raised concerns about the industry disturbing local habitats, including those of the sagebrush lizard, which was listed as an endangered species last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "\u201cIn addition to that, we know that the sand will expedite further drilling nearby,\u201d said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. \u201cWe could see more drilling than we otherwise would, which means more air pollution, more spills than we otherwise would.\u201d",
      "The Dune Express currently runs for about 12 to 14 hours a day at roughly half capacity but the company expects to it to be rolling along at all hours later this year.",
      "In New Mexico, Lea County Commissioner Brad Weber said he hopes the belt alleviates traffic on a parallel highway where car crashes are frequent.",

      "The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it will reconsider the reach of the nation\u2019s bedrock clean water law and likely further limit the wetlands it covers",
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it will reconsider the reach of the nation\u2019s bedrock clean water law and likely further limit the wetlands it covers, building on a Supreme Court decision two years ago that removed federal protections for significant areas.",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said at agency headquarters in Washington that officials will listen to concerns from farmers and other groups worried about federal interference in how they use their land and then set limited, predictable and lasting rules defining which waterways the Clean Water Act protects.",
      "President Donald Trump sought to shrink the law's reach in his first term while prior Democratic administrations have expanded federal power to regulate the nation's lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and oceans. That's created drastic swings in how the law is interpreted and applied.",
      "In the 2023 Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA, the majority of justices largely agreed with the Trump administration's limited approach. That decision departed from decades of federal rules governing the nation's waterways.",
      "When the Biden administration rewrote protections to comply with Sackett, however, some conservative groups believed that the rule still protected too many wetlands and improperly limited private property rights. On Wednesday, the EPA issued guidance about how the ruling should be implemented to exclude certain wetlands.",
      "\u201cWe are not looking for this to be a ping-pong anymore,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cWhat we are looking for is to simply follow the guidance from Sackett.\u201d",
      "That decision was one of several Supreme Court rulings in recent years that drastically shrank the federal government\u2019s power to regulate the environment and industry. Some states, however, have passed their own laws to strengthen wetlands protections.",
      "For decades, environmental interests and left-leaning policymakers have fought right-leaning industry and agricultural interests in federal court over the Clean Water Act's power. At the center of those cases is the definition of just five words in the law, \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d which determines its reach.",
      "In Sackett, the conservative majority sided with those industry and agricultural interests that sought more flexibility to dig or fill wetlands, finding that federal regulators had long wielded too much authority.",
      "Environmental groups have sharply criticized Sackett, saying it will mean more polluted and filled-in wetlands, which is expected to hit the arid southwest especially hard.",
      "Julian Gonzalez, senior legislative counsel at the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, called the Sackett decision industry's \u201cwhite whale\u201d that achieved weakened environmental protections after years of work. He said the effort is especially concerning now that the EPA is facing drastic cuts, reducing its capacity to enforce the rules.",
      "\u201cDespite the fact that they finally got that decision after all those years, they are still not resting on their laurels,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to continue to find ways to change the Clean Water Act to weaken public safeguards.\u201d",
      "Wetlands filter pollutants, reduce flooding, serve as important habitat and are worth protecting, Gonzalez said.",
      "Sackett was brought by an Idaho couple who wanted to build a house near Priest Lake in the state's panhandle. Chantell and Michael Sackett objected when federal officials identified a soggy part of their land as a wetland, which meant they had to get a permit before they filled it with rocks and soil.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion said federally protected wetlands must be directly adjacent to a \u201crelatively permanent\u201d waterway \u201cconnected to traditionally interstate navigable waters\u201d such as a river or ocean. That viewpoint was similar to a 2006 opinion by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.",
      "They also must have a \u201ccontinuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the \u2018water\u2019 ends and the \u2018wetlands\u2019 begins,\u201d Alito said.",
      "That departed from a 2006 Supreme Court opinion that had established the longtime standard for evaluating which waters were protected. In that case, then-Justice Anthony Kennedy described covered wetlands as having a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d to larger bodies of water.

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have warned shippers that \u201cany Israeli vessel\u201d traveling through nearby Mideast waters is now a target as Israel continues to block aid to the Gaza Strip",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels warned shippers early Wednesday that \u201cany Israeli vessel\u201d traveling through nearby Mideast waters is now a target as Israel continues to block aid to the Gaza Strip.",
      "The warning from the Houthis again throws into chaos a crucial maritime waterway between Asia and Europe, threatens revenue from Egypt's Suez Canal and possibly will halt aid shipments to war zones. The rebels in the past have also had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",
      "The statement from the Houthis' Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center follows a four-day deadline set by the rebels for Israel to resume aid shipments.",
      "\u201cWe hope it is understood that the actions taken by the (Houthi military) ... stem from a deep sense of religious, humanitarian and moral responsibility toward the oppressed Palestinian people and aim to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies,\u201d the statement said.",
      "It described the warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",
      "The statement added: \u201cAny Israeli vessel attempting to violate this ban will be subject to military targeting in the declared operational area.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate sign of an attack on ships. Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israel earlier this month halted all aid coming into the Gaza Strip and has warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for Hamas if the fragile ceasefire in the war isn\u2019t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase of the pause in fighting. The move drew intense international criticism as even before the war the over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza relied on international aid, something that's only intensified after a grinding Israeli military offensive destroyed the enclave.",
      "The maritime security firm Ambrey warned the statements from the Houthis were \u201cambiguous,\u201d likely putting more ships at risk.",
      "It's \u201clikely to have extended once more toward ships partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels managed and/or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel,\u201d the firm said.",
      "There was no direct threat made against the U.S. Navy, whose Bahrain-based 5th Fleet patrols the Mideast. However, the earlier Houthi campaign saw American and Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most-serious combat the Navy had seen since World War II.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other ships associated with its carrier group are operating in the Red Sea now. The U.S. military said Wednesday that its forces in the region \u201cremain vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do what is necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel, assets and partners,\u201d it said.",
      "The rebels\u2019 secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn\u2019t let aid into Gaza. That deadline passed Tuesday.",
      "The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation."

      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",
      "\u201cIf I'd been born a rich man,\u201d he said. Starr added: \u201cWe\u2019re just regular people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",

      "Musk has long wanted Starlink to enter the world\u2019s most populous market, but its entry into India has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Airtel \u2014 India\u2019s second largest telecom operator \u2014 said in a statement that its deal with Starlink depends on whether the subsidiary of U.S. aerospace company SpaceX can receive government approval to begin operating in India.",
      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet and cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",

      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink had yet to comply with security norms, and that a license for satellite communications services would be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "The announcement about the Airtel partnership comes weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Musk in Washington where they discussed issues including space, mobility, technology and innovation.",
      "The deal will \u201cexplore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel\u2019s offerings, and how Airtel\u2019s expertise in the Indian market complements SpaceX\u2019s direct offerings to consumers and businesses,\u201d the company's statement said.",
      "As part of the agreement, the two companies will explore offering Starlink equipment at Airtel\u2019s vast retail store network, Starlink services through Airtel to business customers, and using each other\u2019s network infrastructure to enhance coverage across India.",

      "Attorneys for the daughter of a U.S.-sanctioned Russian billionaire are asking a U.S. federal court for access to the financial records of officials including the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Attorneys for the daughter of a U.S.-sanctioned Russian billionaire asked a U.S. federal court Tuesday for access to the financial records of officials including the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, whose administration is under scrutiny for seizing and selling the family\u2019s 265-foot (81-meter) megayacht and not releasing documents related to the sale.",
      "The filing is the latest development in a global legal saga involving the Alfa Nero megayacht, which remained anchored off the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua for more than two years and whose potential buyers included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.",
      "The megayacht, abandoned by Andrey Guryev, a Russian businessman who founded a fertilizer company, is being sought by his daughter, Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov, who claims she is the rightful owner.",
      "As part of the effort to recover the megayacht, her attorneys stated in the filing that they seek documents and information related to wire transfers and other transactions involving seven people and 12 entities in the past five years.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of millions from the sale of the Alfa Nero is just the beginning,\" said Martin De Luca, with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, adding that the discovery seeks to uncover whether any alleged backroom deals for personal enrichment took place.",
      "The people targeted include Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, his wife, their son and Antigua\u2019s general accountant and its port manager.",
      "The entities include West Indies Oil Company Ltd., an Antigua-based petroleum storage and distribution company of which the government is a majority shareholder, and Fancy Bridge Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment firm that owns shares in the oil company, as does Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., known as PDVSA.",
      "Alfa Nero was anchored off Antigua when the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.",
      "The vessel was not sanctioned by the U.S. government at the time, but officials in Antigua prohibited the megayacht from departing for months, according to the filing.",
      "In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Guryev, saying he was part of a group of \u201cKremlin-connected elites\u201d and \u201ca known close associate\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin, having previously served in his government. The department also designated Guryev\u2019s superyacht as \u201cblocked property,\u201d and said its location tracking was turned off \u201cto avoid seizure.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs innocent people suffer from Russia\u2019s illegal war of aggression, Putin\u2019s allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,\u201d said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.",
      "In June 2023, the superyacht was removed from the sanctions list so Antigua could liquidate it. By then, the island\u2019s government had amended a local act to allow officials to declare vessels as abandoned and sell them at auction, a measure they took with Alfa Nero.",
      "Schmidt, Google\u2019s former CEO, won the highest bid at $67 million but later dropped out, as did other bidders.",
      "In July 2024, the government of Antigua and Barbuda sold it to an anonymous buyer for a reported $40 million, according to the filing, which noted that the vessel originally was valued at an estimated $120 million. It noted that private investigators later identified the buyers as Robert Yildirim and Ali Riza Yildirim of the Yildirim Group, a Turkish construction and shipping conglomerate.",
      "The conglomerate did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
      "Following the sale, Antigua\u2019s prime minister came under fire by opposition party members who demanded details of how the proceeds were spent. They have yet to receive any information.",
      "\u201cThe prime minister does not give information except what he wants people to know,\u201d said D. Gisele Isaac, chairperson of the opposition United Progressive Party. \u201cUp to now, he has never disclosed to us the name of the person who bought Alfa Nero.\u201d",
      "Isaac noted that while Antigua and Barbuda has a Freedom of Information Act, an information commissioner appointed last year has no physical office.",
      "\u201cThere is nowhere to request information even if they were inclined to give it,\u201d she said of the current administration, adding that she believes proceeds from the yacht sale should go to helping rebuild Ukraine.",
      "Browne\u2019s wife, Maria Browne, Antigua\u2019s Minister of Housing, told The Antigua Observer newspaper in July 2024 that the proceeds were used to pay off government debt. Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.",
      "The filing noted that nearly $10 million remains unaccounted for and that investigators in the case were told the sale documents \u201cwere no longer available because they had apparently gone missing.\u201d",
      "Gaston Browne did not immediately return a message for comment.",
      "Legal cases related to Alfa Nero also are ongoing in Russia and the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. One case alleges that the seizure and sale of the megayacht is unconstitutional, with Browne previously claiming that the lawsuit before the regional court filed by Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov was \u201cfrivolous.\u201d",

      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled Japan for Lebanon.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Nishida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "Yoji Muto was in Washington for last ditch negotiations over the tariffs on a range of Japanese exports including cars, steel and aluminum.",

      "His meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett came just two days before the steel and aluminum tariffs are due to take effect. President Donald Trump has also said a possible 25% tariff on imported foreign autos could take effect in early April.",
      "Muto said the U.S. officials acknowledged Japanese contributions and agreed to continue talks, but did not approve his request for Japan's exemption from the steep import duties.",
      "\u201cWe did not receive a response that Japan will be exempt,\u201d Muto told reporters. \u201cWe must continue to assert our position.\u201d",

      "Japan depends heavily on exports and the auto tariffs would hurt, because vehicles are its biggest export and the United States is their top destination.",
      "\u201cClearly companies in Japan are very concerned,\u201d said Rintaro Nishimura, political analyst and associate at Japan Practice of The Asia Group. \u201cObviously the auto is the crown jewel for Japan, especially in the context of these tariffs.\" He says they are concerned also because the Trump administration is carrying it out in just two months after taking office.",
      "Trump also has criticized Japan\u2019s contributions to the two countries\u2019 mutual defense arrangements, adding to tensions with Tokyo.",
      "Muto said the two sides agreed to keep discussing to find ways to establish a \u201cwin-win\u201d relationship that would serve national interests of both countries.",
      "The two sides also discussed energy cooperation, including joint development of liquefied natural gas reserves in Alaska, which Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed on during Ishiba's visit to the White House in February.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, restated vigorously soon after he returned to the White House in January, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that includes demands for Ukraine to hand over mineral rights in exchange for continued military aid, threats to take control of the Panama Canal, and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and Trump wants to make sure that the U.S. controls this mineral-rich country that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally that has rejected Trump\u2019s overtures. Denmark has also recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Amid concerns about foreign interference and demands that Greenlanders must control their own destiny, the island\u2019s prime minister called early an parliamentary election for Tuesday.",
      "The world\u2019s largest island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.",
      "Climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting the competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: we are soon entering the Arctic Century, and its most defining feature will be Greenland\u2019s meteoric rise, sustained prominence and ubiquitous influence,\u2019\u2019 said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative.",
      "\u201cGreenland \u2014 located on the crossroads between North America, Europe and Asia, and with enormous resource potential \u2014 will only become more strategically important, with all powers great and small seeking to pay court to it. One is quite keen to go a step further and buy it.\u201d",
      "The following are some of the factors that are driving U.S. interest in Greenland.",
      "Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change, the hunt for scarce resources and increasing international tensions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are once again driving competition in the region.",
      "Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure that it didn\u2019t fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes.",
      "The U.S. has retained bases in Greenland since the war, and the Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO. Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.",
      "Greenland has large deposits of so-called rare earth minerals that are needed to make everything from computers and smartphones to the batteries, solar and wind technologies that will power the transition away from fossil fuels. The U.S. Geological Survey has also identified potential offshore deposits of oil and natural gas.",
      "Greenlanders are keen to develop the resources, but they have enacted strict rules to protect the environment. There are also questions about the feasibility of extracting Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth because of the region\u2019s harsh climate.",
      "Greenland\u2019s retreating ice cap is exposing the country\u2019s mineral wealth and melting sea ice is opening up the once mythical Northwest Passage through the Arctic.",
      "Greenland sits strategically along two potential routes through the Arctic, which would reduce shipping times between the North Atlantic and Pacific and bypass the bottlenecks of the Suez and Panama canals. While the routes aren\u2019t likely to be commercially viable for many years, they are attracting attention.",
      "In 2018, China declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.",
      "Then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China\u2019s move, saying: \u201cDo we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?\u201d A Chinese backed rare earth mining project in Greenland stalled after the local government banned uranium mining in 2021.",
      "The legislation that extended self-government to Greenland in 2009 also recognized the country\u2019s right to independence under international law. Opinion polls show a majority of Greenlanders favor independence, though they differ on exactly when that should occur. The potential for independence raises questions about outside interference in Greenland that could threaten U.S. interests in the country."

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Joshua Jefferson had 19 points, Dishon Jackson added 10 points and 15 rebounds, and No. 12 Iowa State leaned on its big men to beat Cincinnati 76-56 in the second round of the Big 12 Tournament on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry is off to a strong start in his return to the NHL",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Tristan Jarry's career was at a crossroads in mid-January. The Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender was struggling and even worse, the franchise's faith in him appeared to be shot.",
      "Things grew so bleak for Jarry at the end of a stretch in which he dropped six straight starts that general manager Kyle Dubas \u2014 the same man who'd signed Jarry to a five-year deal shortly after taking over in the summer of 2023 \u2014 made the unusual decision to send Jarry to the minors.",
      "Not just to get some reps in, but seemingly for good.",
      "Players with two All-Star appearances and millions in the bank typically don't make their way back after a fall like that. At least not with the same team.",
      "Yet there Jarry was on Tuesday night standing inside PPG Paints Arena, turning aside 36 shots in a 3-2 overtime victory over Vegas that offered hope that while Pittsburgh's season is all but lost, Jarry's tenure with the only NHL club he's ever known might not be.",
      "Yes, those six-plus weeks in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton riding the bus to Bridgeport and Lehigh Valley were \u201ctough\u201d as he put it. They may also have been necessary.",
      "\u201cIt was something I had to work through,\u201d Jarry said. \u201cSomething I need to look at myself in the mirror and just say \u2018I need to have a better game.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "With Josh Allen's personal and financial life set, the NFL MVP is focusing his attention on unfinished business: leading the Buffalo Bills to a Super Bowl title",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- As blessed as Josh Allen considers himself following a year in which he was voted NFL MVP, got engaged to a Hollywood actor and became one of the league\u2019s top-paid players, one item remains on the Buffalo Bills quarterback\u2019s to-do list.",
      "Win a Super Bowl, of course.",
      "\u201cAnybody I run into, friend or not friend, it\u2019s always a congrats for having a heck of a year,\u201d Allen told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd when you kind of look back at it, the only thing missing is finishing our season with a win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only thing I\u2019m thinking about, just trying to continue to get better and find a way to bring a Lombardi Trophy to western New York.\u201d",
      "Though his focus remains on the future, Allen took time to appreciate the moment, three days after agreeing to a six-year, $330 million contract extension, with an NFL-record $250 million guaranteed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty surreal feeling. And 8-year-old me would obviously be just as pumped as a 28-year-old me,\u201d Allen said, speaking on a Zoom call from his offseason base in Southern California.",
      "\u201cI just think I\u2019m blessed. Sometimes it is a little breath-taking, or you can\u2019t find the right words on how to describe it,\" he added. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty lucky guy.\u201d",
      "Resilient, too, as Allen also reflected on the obstacles he has overcome: from starting his career at Reedley Community College in Central California, to transferring to Wyoming, where he was knocked for being raw and inaccurate, never mind those who continued to doubt him over the past year.",
      "\u201cMaybe, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Allen said with a laugh on whether he\u2019s closed the book on being called overrated.",
      "Though the closest he has led the Bills to a Super Bowl berth is two AFC championship game losses to Kansas City in 2020 and this past season, Allen has a hold on his adopted community and team that are unquestioned since Buffalo traded up five spots to draft him seventh overall in 2018.",
      "He has set nearly every single-season franchise passing and scoring record for his position while leading Buffalo to five straight AFC East titles.",
      "And he\u2019s coming off a season regarded as his most memorable on and off the field.",
      "Allen became the Bills third player to win MVP honors, being recognized for essentially achieving more with less after Buffalo traded top threat Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency. He combined for 41 touchdowns, including one receiving, with a career-low six interceptions in a 13-win season.",
      "Off the field, he got engaged to Hailee Steinfeld in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what\u2019s going on in my life and finding the person that I want to share it with,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhen you have that piece figured out, it seems like everything else kind of comes a little bit easier.\u201d",
      "Now Allen has a new contract that locks him in through 2030, a deal he negotiated with an eye on helping the team. As eye-popping as the numbers are, Allen made sure the contract helped the Bills by freeing up much-needed salary cap space in order to retain and add talent.",
      "The benefits were readily apparent in the days leading up to free agency on Wednesday. The Bills upgraded their defensive line by signing edge rusher Joey Bosa and tackle Larry Ogunjobi to one-year deals and landed receiver Joshua Palmer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s weird to say this, but what is $5 million more going to do for my life that I can\u2019t already do right now. It\u2019s not that crazy to me,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI was like, if it has any impact on the cap, let\u2019s figure out a way to not do that.\u201d",
      "Though Allen\u2019s deal places him tied for second among NFL players by averaging $55 million per year, the contract ranks 13th by taking up only 19.7% of his team\u2019s cap total.",
      "Allen is cashing in for a second time, following the six-year, $258 million deal he signed in August 2021. Buffalo is where Allen feels like home, and it\u2019s where he wants to finish out his career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to play anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to put the cleats up, hopefully it\u2019ll be in Buffalo.\u201d",
      "Allen then laughed, saying he\u2019s far from considering retirement, while at the same time appreciating how quickly time has passed.",
      "\u201cIt feels like an eternity ago, but I still remember being the guy sitting on the sidelines in junior college just waiting for a chance to get on the field,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a very nostalgic person. I focus more so on what\u2019s going on right now, trying to be where my feet are and take it just one day at a time.\u201d",

      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Isaac Ukwu's sights were solely set on just playing in the NFL \u2014 until two season-ending knee injuries in college served as a harsh reality of football's fragility.",
      "The setbacks reshaped Ukwu's perspective, showing him that football was part of him, but not all of him. Even after signing with the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent last year, the defensive end knew he needed more than just the game.",
      "So, when the NFL introduced a program for players exploring careers in film and television, he seized the chance to build his off-the-field legacy.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t let your entire identity be football,\u201d said Ukwu, an aspiring actor, who was one of 20-plus former and active NFL players selected to join film training sessions at the NFL Career Tour hosted by Hidden Empire and Skydance Sports. During the three-day sessions, athletes explored the nuances of filmmaking \u2014 learning behind-the-camera roles like directing, producing and other essential elements of bringing a project to life \u2014 while also sharpening their skills as actors.",
      "The sessions recently concluded with the creation of short films at the Hidden Empire studios in Santa Monica, California. The company is led by independent filmmaker Deon Taylor, best known for \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d and \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d and his wife Roxanne Avent Taylor.",
      "\u201cThis experience is really invaluable,\u201d said Ukwu, who hopes to break into acting before eventually exploring directing and producing.",
      "Some of the players featured in the sessions included Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, Cincinnati Bengals lineman Orlando Brown, Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward, Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins and Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley.",
      "It\u2019s the third year of program \u2014 which has featured panelists including entertainers Tyrese Gibson and Master P and retired NFL player Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cThey let you know there\u2019s a way to enter that door,\u201d said Heyward, a seven-time Pro Bowler, who's interested in becoming a director or producer. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to come from a film background. But if you appreciate films and you\u2019re a fan of it, there\u2019s a space for you.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s vision is to redefine storytelling and build a pipeline for authentic, culture-driven narratives straight from the world\u2019s top athletes.",
      "He sees the Hidden Empire Sports Collective \u2014 launched last month \u2014 as a key step in helping athletes prepare for life beyond the game. This new entertainment division focuses on amplifying athletes\u2019 voices through content creation and intellectual property development.",
      "\u201cWe should be educating athletes on how to actually create content, make IP themselves,\u201d said Taylor, who played basketball in East Germany before he ultimately directed other notable titles such as \u201cMeet the Blacks\" and \u201cFatale.\u201d He\u2019s become a major player in the independent filmmaking space.",
      "\u201cBut then more importantly, it\u2019s being a sound information highway for them to understand how they could take something that was great in their life or something that was painful in their lives, tweak it and make it become something that could be content,\u201d he said.",
      "The sports collective has partnered with several athletes, landing developmental deals with stars like boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., NBA champion Scottie Pippen and Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden. One upcoming project is a four-part docuseries on Mayweather's life.",
      "With the training sessions, Taylor believes athletes can find inspiration through the sports collective and Ephraim Salaam, who successfully transitioned from the NFL to Hollywood. After playing 13 seasons in the league, he has built a career as a screenwriter.",
      "Salaam stressed to pro athletes the importance of owning their stories. He noted that they can offer a deeper perspective on their lives that might captivate the masses.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 thing I always tell them is \u2018You\u2019re one of one,\u2019\u201d said Salaam, who is the collective's president of talent strategy and creative executive. \u201cYou\u2019ve been able to look and see life through a lens very few people have. That information is valuable in a writers room.\u201d",
      "In just a few days, athletes dove into filmmaking with the same intensity they bring to studying playbooks.",
      "Players broke into different groups to film scenes for their own movie using iPhones. They went through career and educational panels along with interactive workshops that included a tour of Paramount Studios.",
      "Many assumed acting was their standout skill \u2014 until they realized every role on a project is just as crucial to the final score.",
      "For Okwu, he learned that a film producer wears many hats, much like an NFL general manager, overseeing everything from reading scripts to securing directors and funding projects. He credits Taylor for guiding him and his peers through their early filmmaking journey.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if I was in high school and I had access to Dan Campbell just to talk and coach me up on some things that can lead my success in the future,\u201d said Okwu.",
      "The project took shape after an NFL Career Tour stop, an initiative designed to provide insight into the entertainment industry. This tour is part of Skydance Sports, a joint NFL-Skydance venture offering athletes a behind-the-scenes look at sports programming and storytelling.",
      "The collaboration aims to equip players with the tools to transition into media, content creation and production to share their own narratives with the world.",
      "\u201cWithout the players, there is no game,\u201d said Tracy Perlman, senior vice president of player operation for the NFL. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to build athletes. We want to build people.\"",
      "Dion Dawkins said the opportunities are ripe for the taking.",
      "\u201cYou have to create your lane without that helmet on,\u201d said Dawkins, a four-time Pro Bowler who's an aspiring actor with a big personality. He gets inspired watching former NFL players who transitioned into the TV and film industry such as Salaam, Terry Crews, Laith Wallschleger and Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cIf you think you\u2019re bigger than a football player, you have avenues that can show it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we have OGs that have done it, and doing it currently, it gives you that bit of ... I\u2019m not an outsider, I\u2019m an insider. As long as I conduct and control myself in the right manner, I\u2019ll have a chance.\u201d",

      "The scandal has shocked the ski jumping world, raising questions about how widespread this practice is, and tarnished Norway\u2019s standing for honesty in sports.",
      "What has emerged involves team officials manipulating pre-approved and microchipped suits to increase their size and improve aerodynamics to help athletes fly further.",
      "It was revealed in footage secretly filmed from behind a curtain then sent by a whistle blower to international media. An official from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) said the illegal alterations were only subsequently confirmed by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the offending Norwegian ski suits.",

      "If the infractions seemed obscure and technical to non-fans, the breach of trust was severe: \u201cThis action was somehow killing our principles, our style, our joy for our discipline,\u201d Pertile said.",
      "The Norwegian federation acted when FIS officials found evidence that proved what the secret footage alleged, and had led to formal protests from Austria, Slovenia and Poland.",
      "Norway men\u2019s head coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe regret it like dogs, and I\u2019m terribly sorry that this happened,\u201d Brevig said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.\u201d",
      "Livelten apologized to the disqualified athletes plus \u201csponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people\u201d for an act of cheating he said was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was an extremely high level manipulation,\u201d race director Pertile said of the Norwegian actions that were \u201cabsolutely by far the worst\u201d in his five years in the job. \u201cWe destroyed the suit to be able to find this adjustment.\u201d",
      "The Italian official said alterations were not detected by eye and only were revealed by examining the seams of the crotch area of the ski suits after the competition.",
      "Extra material in the same color had been inserted that added weight and helped to lower the material between an athlete's legs as they took off into the flight phase. More surface area hitting the air helps add to flight time, Pertile said.",
      "FIS previously said a 5% bigger surface area of a suit helps an athlete fly further, though the exact distance added is not known, Pertile said.",
      "FIS has an extensive 11-page document of rules for measuring and verifying ski jumpers' suits during the season. Multiple RFID chips are attached and noted on a FIS register, after which a suit must not be altered. Any attempt to remove a chip should make the suit ineligible and the chips are deactivated.",
      "One suit is allowed at World Cup events and two more for a world championships or Winter Olympics, though just one is used on each competition day.",
      "FIS investigators are now likely to want to closely inspect all the Norwegian team suits, in men's and women's ski jumping and Nordic combined, at the world championships.",
      "Lindvik's gold medal in normal hill is sure to be looked at, though it is unclear how far back an investigation could reach for results at World Cup events this season or beyond to previous seasons. Lindvik was Olympic champion in large hill at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.",

      "The NCAA selection committee will have some juggling to do before the bracket comes out Sunday to keep March Madness from looking like an extension of the Southeastern Conference\u2019s regular season",
      "The NCAA selection committee will have some juggling to do before the bracket comes out Sunday to keep March Madness from looking like an extension of the Southeastern Conference's regular season.",
      "With the country's deepest league in line to place between 12 and 14 teams in the tournament, some long-held guidelines drawn to help set the matchups will have to give way, bringing the possibility that conference rivals could face each other as early as the second round or the Sweet 16.",
      "\u201cWe will move it to try to ensure they don't play each other too frequently,\u201d the chair of the selection committee, North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, said Wednesday in a call to preview the selection. \u201cBut it is a reality of where we are today.\u201d",
      "The reality is shaped thanks in part to a flurry of realignment that has left college sports with four megaconferences. Three of those will gobble up nearly half of the 68 spots in the tournament. The record for a conference came in 2011 when the Big East placed 11 teams in the bracket.",
      "Some projections have the SEC earning up to 14 spots, the Big Ten getting as many as 10 and the Big 12 earning up to eight. Of those 32 projected spots, seven could go to teams that were in different conferences as recently as 2023 \u2014 programs such as Oklahoma, Oregon and BYU.",
      "There will be some big-picture repercussions from all this realignment. In a notable development earlier this week, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark got on board with an idea to expand the tournament to 76 teams in a move that would favor Power Four conferences.",
      "More urgently, though, having so many teams from so few conferences will force the 12 members of the selection committee, who are holed up in a conference room in Indiana this week, to make some nontraditional decisions.",
      "The NCAA bracketing principles frown on teams that have played three times in a season from meeting before the Elite Eight. Likewise, they urge the committee to avoid potential pairings between teams that have played twice coming before the Sweet 16. But, in a tweak that was put in for this season, the principles note that those rules \u201ccan be relaxed if a league has nine or more teams in the tournament.\u201d",
      "Cunningham said the committee's biggest priority will be getting the seedings right, an exercise that could make it more difficult to avoid these early matchups.",
      "\u201cWe really try to keep everybody on the same seed line\" they've earned, he said. \u201cWe don't want to move them to a different seed line because that really does impact the tournament. But it'll be a little bit trickier this year.\"",
      "The SEC's dominance is showing up not only in the sheer volume of teams but also where they land. Auburn is a lock for a No. 1 seed, with Florida considered a slight favorite to edge out Tennessee and Alabama for another.",
      "Among the biggest questions is whether the top overall seed in the tournament will go to Auburn or Duke, which this week supplanted the Tigers at No. 1 in the AP Top 25. The irony there is that Duke is one of only three teams from the ACC projected to make the field of 68, which would mark the hoops powerhouse's lowest total in 25 years.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Robert Morris coach Andrew Toole stood next to the staging area near midcourt Tuesday night, the confetti strewn around him as the jubilant Colonials players danced, mingled with fans and climbed ladders to cut down the nets.",
      "It was a moment of pure joy for the school located in suburban Pittsburgh.",
      "But for Toole, winning his first Horizon League Tournament title came with bittersweet memories from the last time his team earned an NCAA Tournament bid \u2014 two days before the event was canceled on March 12, 2020, because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst locker room I've ever been in,\u201d he said minutes after the victory over Youngstown State, describing a team meeting from five years earlier. \"To be part of the greatest tournament in college athletics and maybe sports in general and you don't see that come to fruition when you've earned it, when you've won it, it's a killer. I've had more opportunities to try to do it again, but these guys only have a short amount of time so when you get it in your hands and it gets robbed from you, it's heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just Toole and Robert Morris, of course. Nor was it just college basketball. On that Thursday afternoon, NCAA officials announced the cancellation of all remaining winter and spring championships. Other sporting events around the world ended up being affected as well, including the Tokyo Olympics.",
      "The decision to cancel March Madness had long-lasting consequences everywhere, especially for schools whose one shining moment often comes from the journey of earning the only NCAA bid their conference receives. For Robert Morris, that was the Northeast Conference.",
      "At Indiana University-Indianapolis, that meant the women's team put its first ever NCAA game on hold for two more seasons despite winning the 2020 Horizon League tourney.",
      "And even now, NCAA officials are keenly aware of the anger, sadness, frustration and disbelief caused by the decision to prioritize public health safety over so many lifetime dreams of competing for a national championship.",
      "\u201cThat was a real tough day for college athletics, a really difficult day for the NCAA staff as well as the (selection) committee,\u201d this year's men's committee chair Bubba Cunningham said during a Zoom call Wednesday. \u201cAt that time, there was an awful lot of anxiety and concern about what was happening to the country.\u201d",
      "The first indications the sports world could get swept up in the health crisis filtered out March 11, 2020, when the NBA announced it was suspending its season after Utah center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.",
      "The next scare came later that night at the Big Ten Tournament when Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg became visibly ill on the sideline and was taken to an Indianapolis hospital. He did not have COVID.",
      "By the next morning, though, some conferences decided their tournaments would continue \u2014 albeit without fans. But as Michigan and Rutgers warmed up for the first game in Indianapolis on March 12, UMass and VCU were doing the same at the Atlantic 10 Tournament in Brooklyn, New York, when all four teams learned they weren't playing.",
      "\u201cTwo minutes left in warm-up, you're out on the court, you've got your game face on, you're locked in and then no game,\u201d then-VCU coach Mike Rhoades said at the time. \u201cIt's surreal.\u201d",
      "UMass coach Matt McCall went a step further, telling his players that 10 years later, they would still remember where they were when the announcement came.",
      "It's a day nobody in the college basketball world may ever forget, and a half decade later that's still the case.",
      "Toole remembers seeing the official announcement on social media before he could even tell his devastated players.",
      "\u201cYour whole team knows about it, so you can't control the narrative,\u201d Toole said. \u201cYou can't do anything to soften the blow. So we met that Friday morning and you walk in and it's like a morgue. I mean, they already knew the news. You didn't have to tell them, that's what made it so hard.\u201d",
      "While the news may have hit hardest at schools such as Robert Morris, it was a big deal everywhere.",
      "Kansas and Gonzaga were ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in what turned out to be the final Associated Press Top 25. Dayton and San Diego State were ranked Nos. 3 and 6 and Kentucky was No. 8.",
      "\u201cFive years ago today we weren\u2019t doing this!\u201d SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey wrote on Twitter, posted with a photo of a basketball game. \u201cNever take for granted the special opportunities and the chance to watch teams from the greatest basketball conference in the land!\u201d",
      "So as stunning as it seemed to shut down the sports world in March 2020, it's still unfathomable for today's players to comprehend what that month was like for their predecessors, the ones who never reaped the real rewards from their accomplishments.",
      "\u201cI think for those guys, all the hard work they put in to not go to the tournament, it's a sour taste, a sour feeling,\u201d Robert Morris guard Josh Omojafo said. \u201cThe team this year, we knew (what happened in 2020). We used that as motivation, you know, we wanted to get that back for them. That was our model for the whole year.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The race for the two wild-card playoff spots in the NHL\u2019s Eastern Conference is full of surprises",
      "The Ottawa Senators last qualified for the playoffs in 2017, while the Columbus Blue Jackets have only won a round once in more than two decades of existence and none since before the pandemic.",
      "The New York Rangers were the top team in the NHL last season before making a run to the Eastern Conference final and losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. The Boston Bruins are just two years removed from setting league records for wins and points in a season.",
      "Now those four teams are competing for the two wild-card spots in the East, coming from very different directions.",
      "It's a surprise the Blue Jackets are in the race at all, the Senators have showed they belong and the Rangers and Bruins have clawed back in it after underachieving for several months.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s giving up, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Columbus general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tight race the rest of the way. We\u2019re just hoping that we can continue to win more games than we lose, and if we do that we\u2019ll be in good shape.\u201d",
      "The pesky Sens won five of their first six games in March to get in the driver's seat for the seventh seed behind likely playoff teams Washington, Florida, Carolina, Toronto, Tampa Bay and New Jersey. They have 73 standings points with 18 games remaining.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about being in the playoff picture right now,\u201d alternate captain Claude Giroux said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how we\u2019re playing. How we want to play, we have a belief that it\u2019s going to make us be in the playoffs.\"",
      "First-year coach Travis Green has set a competitive tone since training camp.",
      "\"He had us ready from the get-go,\" said veteran winger David Perron, who won the Cup with St. Louis in 2019. \"There\u2019s going to be some stretches where you don\u2019t play as good, whatever it is, either individually or the team. I think he\u2019s done a good job to kind of reset us at the right times.\"",
      "Captain Brady Tkachuk has a team-best 27 goals, center Tim St\u00fctzle has 21 points in his past 16 games to lead Ottawa with 66 and only reigning MVP Nathan MacKinnon has scored more than defenseman Jake Sanderson this month. Add some great goaltending from 2023 Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark, and the fun times are rolling on the ice in Canada's capital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Perron said. \u201cYou play those kind of meaningful games and those important games that we are right now and that we have been for a little bit, it\u2019s the best feeling.\u201d",
      "The death in late August of top forward Johnny Gaudreau, who was killed along with his brother, Matthew, while riding their bicycles near their New Jersey hometown on the eve of their sister Katie's wedding was the latest shock to a tortured organization that was three years removed from goaltender Matiss Kivlenieks dying in a July Fourth fireworks accident.",
      "With Waddell taking over and installing Dean Evason as coach, the expectations on the ice this season were very low \u2014 and that was before captain Boone Jenner had shoulder surgery before opening night. Columbus was a 15-1 long shot to even make the playoffs and as high as 25-1 in November on BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "Then point-a-game defenseman Zach Werenski led the way and he and his teammates hold the second and final wild-card spot with 70 points and 18 games left.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just leaving it all out there every night, and we\u2019re giving ourselves a chance to win,\u201d Werenski said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun. It\u2019s been one of the more fun years I\u2019ve had, and it\u2019s been a battle. We\u2019ve been battling every night and it\u2019s not been smooth sailing all the time, but I\u2019ve just really enjoyed battling with these guys.\u201d",
      "Waddell conceded he \u201ckept waiting for the bubble to burst,\u201d but then the likes of tough guy Mathieu Olivier, young Adam Fantilli and Kent Johnson and veteran Sean Monahan \u2014 a close friend of Gaudreau's \u2014 stepped up to keep things rolling against all odds.",
      "\u201cIt feels like this year we were turning a corner,\u201d Olivier said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a really realistic push for playoffs here, which is our goal.\u201d",
      "Bringing back elite center J.T. Miller has paid big dividends for the Rangers, who were in a funk until January. Miller has 16 points in 15 games since the trade from Vancouver, and it has also helped that top players such as Mika Zibanejad, Artemi Panarin and Vincent Trocheck have raised their level.",
      "They've lost four in a row, but the Rangers with 68 points and 17 games remaining are right in the mix, two points back of Columbus.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a playoff fight right now,\u201d defenseman Will Borgen told reporters in Winnipeg after losing 2-1 to the Jets on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re battling for every point. ... We\u2019ve got to string along some wins if we want to make the playoffs.\u201d",
      "A little like the Rangers, the Bruins bought and sold \u2014 but mostly sold \u2014 at the trade deadline, sending Brad Marchand to Florida, Brandon Carlo to Toronto, Justin Brazeau to Minnesota, Trent Frederic to Edmonton and Charlie Coyle to Colorado. It looked as if they were pulling the plug on a lost season, but beating the playoff-bound Lightning and Panthers back-to-back has Boston right in the thick of the hunt with 68 points and 16 games to play.",
      "Coach Joe Sacco knows the spot his team is in and what just happened. Goaltender Jeremy Swayman, as a result, believes he and his teammates are \u201cgetting hungrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're not giving up on this group,\u201d Swayman said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t be more proud of the guys, the way that their effort is and the way that we\u2019re competing as a team and just being cohesive and we\u2019re obviously getting results.\"",
      "The Montreal Canadiens pulled even with New York and Boston at 68 points by beating the Canucks on Tuesday night. Going into Wednesday's action, the Detroit Red Wings (66 points with 18 games left) are four points out.",
      "While the Canadiens are ahead of schedule in their organizational retooling effort, the Red Wings came up just short a year ago and are in danger of extending the longest playoff drought in franchise history.",
      "Five points back on the very fringe of contention are the New York Islanders (65 points with 18 games left), who have lost seven of 11 and traded pending free agent center Brock Nelson to Colorado on the eve of the trade deadline.",

      "Scientists report that a fossil of a partial face from a early human ancestor in Spain is between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old",
      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Schools are turning to AI-powered surveillance technology to monitor students on school-issued devices like laptops and tablets",
      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "NASA's newest space telescope has blasted off to map the entire sky like never before",
      "NASA\u2019s newest space telescope rocketed into orbit Tuesday to map the entire sky like never before \u2014 a sweeping look at hundreds of millions of galaxies and their shared cosmic glow since the beginning of time.",
      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",
      "It's like \"looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses,\u201d said deputy project manager Beth Fabinsky of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "To keep the infrared detectors super cold \u2014 minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius) \u2014 Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",
      "The evening launch was delayed two weeks because of rocket and other issues.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

    "story": [
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "Ladi Anzaki Olubunmi, a content moderator for TikTok employed by the subcontractor Teleperformance Kenya, died last week and her decomposing body was discovered in her house after three days.",
      "It was unclear what caused her death, but colleagues say she had complained of fatigue and was \u201cdesperate to go back home.\u201d",
      "Teleperformance Kenya told The Associated Press on Wednesday that they didn't deny Olubunmi her leave to go home. Her family in Nigeria says she only traveled once since coming to Kenya three years ago.",

      "Nissan Motor Corp. recently showcased its driverless technology on city streets in Yokohama",
      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and there's no one in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own \u201ccity\u201d or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving.",
      "Progress has been cautious.",
      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human can\u2019t be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors.",
      "When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well.",
      "Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started.",
      "The main problem is what\u2019s known as \u201cedge cases,\u201d those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said.",
      "\u201cWe will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years,\u201d said Koopman.",
      "\u201cThere is no magic switch.\u201d",

      "The stock climbed more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday.",
      "Numerous auto industry analysts have attributed Tesla's recent sagging stock \u2014 and auto sales \u2014 to Musk's support of Trump and other far right candidates around the world. In recent days, Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized on the street.

      "Musk has become the face of the Trump administration's slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending.",
      "Analysts have said Musk's shift to right-wing politics doesn't appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy and progressive consumers.",
      "Tesla sales are falling precipitously in California, the company's biggest U.S. market, and the company recorded its first annual global sales decline last year. Similarly, Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France.",
      "The latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies.",
      "But sales in the U.S. have fallen due to competition, and a country sharply divided about Trump.",
      "U.S. Analysts at UBS Global Research expect deliveries to fall 5% in the first quarter and full year compared to the same periods for 2024.",
      "\u201cOur UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within two weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In addition to backing Trump, Musk has also shown support for the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d and called Canada \u2014 a major Tesla market \u2014\"not a real country.\u201d",
      "Tesla is not the only Musk-led company to run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a \u201cmassive\" cyberattack. But like the clear-cutting he's done with federal jobs, Musk slashed the number of employees at X and technology experts warned of increased vulnerability.",

      "Researchers, doctors, their patients and supporters are venturing out of labs, hospitals and offices across the country to stand up to what they call an attack on life-saving science by the Trump administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Researchers, doctors, their patients and supporters ventured out of labs, hospitals and offices Friday to stand up to what they call a blitz on life-saving science by the Trump administration.",
      "In the nation's capital, several hundred people gathered at the Stand Up for Science rally. Organizers said similar rallies were planned in more than 30 U.S. cities.",
      "Politicians, scientists, musicians, doctors and their patients were expected to make the case that firings, budget and grant cuts in health, climate, science and other research government agencies in the Trump administration's first 47 days in office are endangering not just the future but the present.",
      "\u201cScience is under attack in the United States,\u201d said rally co-organizer Colette Delawalla, a doctoral student in clinical psychology. \u201cWe're not just going to stand here and take it.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerican scientific progress and forward movement is a public good and public good is coming to a screeching halt right now,\u201d Delawalla said.",
      "Health and science advances are happening faster than ever, said former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, who helped map the human genome. The funding cuts put at risk progress on Alzheimer's Disease, diabetes and cancer, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's a very bad time with all the promise and momentum,\" said Collins.",
      "Friday's rally in Washington was at the Lincoln Memorial, in the shadow of a statue of the president who created the National Academy of Sciences in 1863. Some of the expected speakers study giant colliding galaxies, the tiny genetic blueprint of life inside humans and the warming atmosphere.",
      "Nobel Prize winning biologist Victor Ambros, Bill Nye The Science Guy, former NASA chief Bill Nelson and a host of other politicians, and patients \u2014 some with rare diseases \u2014 were expected to take the stage to talk about their work and the importance of scientific research.",
      "The rallies were organized mostly by graduate students and early career scientists. Dozens of other protests were also planned around the world, including more than 30 in France, Delawalla said.",
      "\u201cThe cuts in science funding affects the world,\u201d she said.",
      "She said the administration\u2019s campaign to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion have delayed and threatened her grant because the National Institutes of Health is scrubbing proposals with words such as \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cwoman.\u201d Her research focuses on compulsive alcohol use in people, which is different for men and women.",

    "story": [
      "Former Sen. Brian Kelsey was two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence.",
      "A former Tennessee lawmaker who was once represented by White House Counsel David Warrington said he received a pardon from President Donald Trump after pleading guilty to an illegal campaign finance scheme in 2022.",
      "The White House has not said anything publicly about former Sen. Brian Kelsey's pardon, but sources familiar with the matter told ABC News that Trump signed the pardon paperwork on Tuesday.",
      "The White House counsel's office normally reviews presidential pardons, and it was not immediately clear if Warrington recused himself from his former client's pardon.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Warrington's level of involvement.",
      "Kelsey was two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence when he received the pardon. Bureau of Prisons records reflected that Kelsey was no longer in custody at FCI Ashland as of Tuesday.",
      "According to federal prosecutors, Kelsey illegally funneled tens of thousands of dollars from his state campaign committee to a federal committee to fund his failed 2016 congressional campaign. He originally pleaded guilty to one felony before later withdrawing his plea while he was represented by Warrington.",
      "\"Defendant Brian Kelsey entered his plea agreement hastily with an unsure heart and confused mind,\" Warrington wrote in a court filing, arguing Kelsey was confused when he decided to plead guilty after his father died and his wife gave birth to twins.",
      "\"The fog and sleep deprivation of taking care of his newborns while dealing with everything else in his life led to his confused mind. Once his mind began clearing, Mr. Kelsey acted quickly to seek to withdraw his plea,\" he wrote.",

He was eventually sentenced to 21 months in prison, though he was allowed to delay serving his sentence while his appeal played out.",
      "Kelsey reported to his minimum-security prison on Feb. 24, spending about two weeks behind bars before Trump issued his pardon.",
      "\"Praise the Lord most high! May God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years. And God bless Donald J. Trump for Making America Great Again!\" Kelsey wrote on social media.",

Norcom High School in Portsmouth, was running the second leg of the 4x200-meter relay when her baton struck Kaelen Tucker, a junior from Brookville High School, in the head. It happened March 4 during the Virginia State High School League Championships at Liberty University in Lynchburg.",
      "Bethany Harrison, the commonwealth's attorney for the city of Lynchburg, confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday that a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery was issued against Everett in the matter.",
      "Additional details on the case were not immediately available.",
      "Video of the incident showed Tucker staggering and reaching for her head after being hit before going off the track. She dropped her baton and was attended to by medical personnel shortly after the incident. She would later be diagnosed with a concussion, she told ABC affiliate WVEC in Hampton, Virginia.",
      "\"I was so in disbelief,\" Tucker told WVEC. \"I didn't know what happened.\"",
      "Everett contended that baton strike was an accident in an interview that aired Tuesday on \"Good Morning America.\"",
      "\"I would never do that on purpose,\" Everett said. \"That's not in my character.\"",
      "The 18-year-old said that during the race, her arm became stuck, and her baton inadvertently struck Tucker as they neared the corner of the track.",
      "\"Her arm was literally hitting the baton -- until she got a little ahead, and my arm got stuck like this,\" she said while holding a baton to emphasize the movement.",
      "The Everetts say they believe their video shows that Tucker's proximity to their daughter led to an accidental collision. According to the family, Tucker was running too close to Everett when she tried to cut ahead, which caused Everett to lose her balance and the baton to make contact with Tucker.",
      "Following the incident, the athletic director at I.C. Norcom High School and Everett's father apologized to the Tucker family in a phone call, according to Tucker's parents.",

      "\"We are committed collectively to ensuring that the criminal justice system, which we feel is not warranted in this situation, is executed fairly and based on due process,\" the organization said in a statement on Wednesday while calling for Everett to be \"void of any criminal proceedings.\"",
      "\"From all accounts, she is an exceptional young leader and scholar whose athletic talent has been well-documented and recognized across our state,\" the Portsmouth NAACP said. \"She has carried herself with integrity both on and off the field and any narrative that adjudicates her guilty of any criminal activity is a violation of her due process rights.\"",

      "Schumer pointed the finger at Republicans for leaving Democrats out of the funding negotiations.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort, but Republicans chose a partisan path drafting their continuing resolution without any input any input from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said on the floor Wednesday.",
      "Unlike in the House, where Republicans can act unilaterally to pass legislation, the Senate needs Democrats to pass a funding bill.",
      "At least 60 votes are needed for a funding bill to clear key procedural votes, called cloture votes, which means at least seven Democrats would be needed to pass any funding bill through the Senate.",

On the other, some Democrats understand that a decision to vote against the bill could likely force an undesirable government shut down.",
      "After days of closed-door meetings and tight-lipped interaction with the press, Schumer said Democrats will instead advocate for a 30-day clean stopgap bill meant to buy more time for appropriators to complete full-year funding bills.",
      "\"Our caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" Schumer said.",
      "Just because that's what Democrats want, doesn't mean it's a vote Democrats will get.",
      "They are the minority in the Senate, and they do not have control over what bills are brought to the Senate floor for a vote. There's nothing that Democrats can do to force a vote in the Senate on a 30-day clean stopgap measure, but they may be able to wheel and deal with Republicans to get a vote on it.",
      "With Schumer saying that Democrats are not ready to proceed, the Democrats hold the cards. If they do not furnish the votes to clear this procedural hurdle and get on to the bill, things could be at a stand still, and a shut down could be on the horizon.",
      "Meanwhile, House Democrats are urging their Senate colleagues to vote no on the funding bill they almost unanimously opposed when it passed through the House on Tuesday evening.",
      "\"House Democrats are very clear. We're asking Senate Democrats to vote 'no' on this continuing resolution, which is not clean, and it makes cuts across the board,\" said Vice Chair Ted Lieu, flanked by five other members of House leadership at a press conference at the Issues Conference at the Lansdowne Resort. Lieu's comments came before Schumer pushed for a 30-day clean stopgap bill.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that conversations are \"continuing\" with Schumer all the way down to rank-and-file Democratic members about keeping the Democratic caucus united against the bill.",
      "\"The House Democratic position is crystal clear as evidenced by the strong vote of opposition that we took yesterday on the House floor opposing the Trump-Musk-Johnson reckless Republican spending bill,\" Jeffries said.",

      "Since the 1860s, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has collected and analyzed data on education across the country, which has been used by policymakers and the public to measure academic success, teacher productivity and crime and safety in schools, among other topics.",
      "It issues a congressionally mandated test called the National Assessment of Education Progress -- better known as the \"Nation's Report Card\" -- which, since 1969, has been considered the gold standard of testing to compare the academic performance and progress of students across all 50 states in math and reading across several grades.",
      "But as of this week, nearly all of the agency's 130 staffers have been fired, according to the former employees, gutting the agency and raising questions about how it can continue its work to measure the performance of the country's 18,000 school districts and efficacy of any policy changes.",
      "\"We are baffled, because thought that we would be spared, that we would be moved, because our work is mandated by law,\" one statistician with more than a decade of experience at the agency told ABC News. \"We thought any administration would want to measure how successful their policies are.\"",

      "Trying to collect and analyze the vast troves of data required to produce reports like the \"Nation's Report Card\" without a full staff \"would be the equivalent of manning a 13-person sailboat with a 12-month-old,\" one employee who was fired this week told ABC News. \"It's not possible.\"",
      "While it's not clear what will happen to the agency, former employees speculated that the Trump administration could follow the recommendations of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 proposal and merge NCES with the Commerce Department's Census Bureau.",
      "\"If things get handed over, it won't be a great host,\" Weko said. \"Do they have good statisticians and survey methodologists? Yes. Do they have a deep understanding of the policy and practice of education in the United States? No.\"",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi is looking into whether Biden administration policies infringe on Americans' right to bear arms.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed the executive order on Feb. 7.",
      "The deadline has quietly passed on Attorney General Pam Bondi delivering a report to President Donald Trump on whether any leftover Biden administration policies infringe on Americans' right to bear arms. It came just days after Democratic leaders sent her a letter suggesting there is \"plainly no need for any new plan of action.\"",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 7 after making campaign promises to gun-rights groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) that \"no one will lay a finger on your firearms.\"",
      "The president instructed Bondi to \"examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans, international agreements, and other actions of executive departments and agencies\" and determine if any of them violate the Second Amendment.",
      "\"The Second Amendment is an indispensable safeguard of security and liberty. It has preserved the right of the American people to protect ourselves, our families, and our freedoms since the founding of our great Nation,\" Trump's executive order reads. \"Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.\"",
      "The 30-day mark for Bondi to report back to Trump through his domestic policy director would have been this past Sunday.",
      "Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University School of Law, told ABC News the broadly written executive order \"signals to me that this isn't a top priority\" for the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cObviously, if there were things that were on the administration's radar as possibly violating the Second Amendment or violating the rights of gun owners in some way, they could have started to roll those back right away and wouldn\u2019t have needed to take this intermediate step of issuing a directive to the Attorney General to figure out what those were,\" Willinger said. \"That suggests that there\u2019s nothing out there that the administration viewed as so pressing that they have to get rid of it right away.\"",
      "After Trump signed the executive order, NRA Executive Vice President Doug Hamlin released a statement praising the president's move.",
      "\"Promises made to law-abiding gun owners are being kept by President Donald J. Trump,\" Hamlin said. \"NRA members were instrumental, turning out in record numbers to secure his victory, and he is proving worthy of their votes, faith and confidence in his first days in office.\"",
      "John Commerford, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, also released a statement, saying, \"After a long four years, law-abiding gun owners no longer have to worry about being the target of an anti-gun radical administration. NRA looks forward to the advances and restoration of our rights that will come from President Trump's respect for the Constitution.\"",
      "It is unclear whether or not Bondi met the deadline on delivering the report -- nothing had been publicly released as of Wednesday. When ABC News asked this week about Bondi's pending plan of action, Department of Justice officials said they would check but had no immediate information on the report's status. The White House also did not respond to ABC News' inquiry about Bondi's pending report.",
      "Earlier this month, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, ranking member of the House subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, sent Bondi a letter.",
      "\"We are determined to protect our communities against lethal gun crime in a manner consistent with the Second Amendment,\" they wrote.",
      "The letter said that if Bondi carried out her examination \"objectively and in good faith\" she'll find that actions taken by the previous administration to fight gun violence are \"perfectly consistent with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "\"There is plainly no need for any new plan of action to, in the words of the executive order, 'protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans,'\" the letter said.",
      "In his executive order, Trump instructed Bondi that in addition to reviewing all presidential actions taken on gun control from January 2021 to January 2025, he wanted her to review rules about firearms and federal firearm licensing implemented by the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).",
      "Trump specifically asked Bondi to review the ATF's \"enhanced regulatory enforcement policy\" -- also called the \"zero tolerance policy\" -- implemented in 2021 under Biden and former Attorney General Merrick Garland to identify federal firearms dealers who violate the 1968 Gun Control Act.",
      "Under the policy, firearms dealers had their licenses revoked for willfully transferring firearms to prohibited people, failing to conduct the required background checks, falsifying records and failing to respond to a gun trace request. The policy prompted several lawsuits from gun dealers who argued their licenses were revoked over minor clerical errors.",
      "Raskin and McBath claimed that in the three years since the policy was implemented, about 0.3% of the nation's roughly 130,000 federal gun dealers had their licenses revoked.",
      "\"Through this policy, ATF has enforced the Gun Control Act as passed by Congress and had revoked the licenses of a tiny fraction of gun dealers who willfully violated the law,\" Raskin and McBath said in their letter to Bondi. \"The ATF's enhanced regulatory policy has not prevented a single American who may lawfully possess a firearm from exercising his or her Second Amendment rights.\"",
      "The ATF reported that in fiscal year 2023, the agency found 1,531 violations after conducting 8,689 firearm compliance inspections. The inspections, according to the ATF, prompted 667 warning letters and 170 revocations.",
      "\"Law-abiding gun dealers remain in business throughout the country. In fact, there remain more gun dealers than there are locations of Starbucks, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King, Subway, and Chick-fil-A combined,\" Raskin and McBath said in their letter.",
      "The Democratic lawmakers asked Bondi to respond to their letter by the end of the business day on Monday, explaining what standards she will use to determine if policies taken by the Biden administration violate the Second Amendment and how she will ensure her plan of action \"does not increase the risk of violent crime, including gun deaths.\"",
      "A Pew Research Center poll released in July 2024 found that 61% of respondents agreed that it is too easy to legally obtain a gun and 58% favored stricter gun laws.",
      "\"We know that the vast majority of Americans -- including gun owners and Trump voters -- support basic safety laws that crack down on crime and keep all communities safe. These policies are in no way inconsistent with the Second Amendment,\" Kris Brown, president of the gun-safety advocacy group Brady United, said in a statement after Trump signed the executive order.",
      "Brown noted that policies under Biden included expanding background checks for gun buyers and \"cracking down on rogue gun traffickers.\"",
      "\"They must be continued if this President actually wants to achieve any of his campaign promises around reducing crime, cracking down on drug traffickers, and reducing the flow of trafficked weapons across the southern border,\" Brown said.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major piece of federal gun reform to clear both chambers in 30 years.",
      "The law enhanced background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21 by giving authorities up to 10 business days to review the juvenile and mental health records of young gun purchasers, and made it unlawful for someone to purchase a gun for someone who would fail a background check. This legislation closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" preventing individuals convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing a gun.",
      "The law included $750 million to help states implement \"red flag\" laws to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, as well as other violence prevention programs. It also provided funding for a variety of programs aimed at shoring up the nation's mental health apparatus and securing schools.",
      "Willinger told ABC News that \"short of asking Congress to appeal it,\" there is little the Trump administration can do about the law.",
      "\"It\u2019s possible that the administration could do stuff to hold up that money,\" Willinger said. \"I don\u2019t know what wiggle room they have to do that.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:59:42 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge entered an emergency order barring the Trump administration from implementing parts of its executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie.",
    "story": [
      "Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday entered an emergency order barring the Trump administration from implementing major parts of its executive order that sought to target the law firm Perkins Coie over its representation of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.",
      "District Judge Beryl Howell, ruling from the bench, found that attorneys for Perkins Coie, who filed suit earlier this week, had met the bar for her to enter a temporary restraining order -- determining they would suffer immediate and irreparable harm if provisions of the order targeting the law firm's work with government contractors as well as restrictions on their attorney's access to government buildings were implemented.",
      "In an extraordinary hearing in which the Justice Department put forward Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, to present its arguments, Howell repeatedly questioned the logic and legality surrounding the order -- which she said had extraordinary breadth and whose language was unlike any other order she'd ever read.",
      "\"Regardless of whether the president dislikes the firm's clients ... issuing an executive order targeting the firm based on the president's dislike of the political positions of the firm's clients, or the firm's litigation positions is retaliatory and runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protection,\" Howell said.",
      "In her ruling blocking parts of the executive order she found \"unlawful,\" Howell stated: \"The President is certainly entitled to his own belief, entitled to his preferred causes and he's entitled to hold tight to his own dislikes. The Constitution protects all of us, however, from the exercise of his targeted power based on those dislikes, triggering the force of the federal government down on the lawyers representing his political opponents and challengers to his political actions, as he has done here.\"",
      "During his exchanges with the judge, Mizelle argued that the order falls squarely within Trump's executive powers and suggested the courts had no jurisdiction to intervene in the matter.",
      "\"The president of the United States is authorized under the Constitution to find that there are certain individuals or certain companies that are not trustworthy with the nation's secrets,\" Mizelle said. \"That's something that the president is afforded to do under the Constitution.\"",
      "Judge Howell pressed Mizelle how Trump's order did anything to address a so-called \"threat\" from Perkins Coie -- given essentially all of the individuals involved in representation of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign have left the firm.",
      "In one exchange, Howell said to Mizelle that the sweeping nature of some of his arguments sent \"chills down my spine.\"",
      "\"When you say that if the president, in his view, takes the position that an individual or an organization or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation's interests, he can issue an executive order like this and take steps to bar that individual, that entity, that company from doing any business with the government, terminate whatever contracts they've got, bar them from federal buildings,\" Howell said. \"I mean, that's a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise.\"",
      "Howell further pressed \u2014 what would happen if Trump were to \"get annoyed\" by the law firm representing Perkins Coie in this lawsuit and issue a separate order targeting them?",
      "\"If he made a finding that there's a national security risk with a particular law firm, then yes,\" Mizelle responded.",
      "Mizelle further sought to downplay the damage Perkins Coie said it has already suffered as a result of the order as \"speculative.\"",
      "\"We're being put up with a bunch of 'what-ifs' and boogeymans and ghosts that we're having to fight about,\" Mizelle said. \"None of those ghosts are real. The boogeymen are not real.\"",
      "The attorney representing Perkins Coie, Dane Butswinkas from the law firm Williams and Connolly, laid out in stark terms the already sweeping damage he said the order has caused since its signing last week.",
      "The firm has lost clients \"each day\" since the order was implemented, Butswinkas said, and the provision of the order that would restrict Perkins Coie's attorneys from engaging with government contractors could paralyze it from effectively serving it's most high-value clients.",
      "\"Every one of the top 15 clients at the law firm has government contracts,\" Butswinkas said. \"I think that accounts for approximately 25% of the revenue of the law firm.\"",
      "To underscore the urgency of the impact of the executive order, Butswinkas closed his argument speaking in dire terms.",
      "\"It truly is life-threatening. I'm not here to exaggerate about it,\" Butswinkas said. \"It will \u2014 it will spell the end of the law firm.\"",
      "At one point in the hearing, the judge raised concern over the provision of the executive order that aims to restrict Perkins Coie from having access to federal buildings. That would, Howell noted, presumably include every federal courthouse in the country --which are technically operated by the General Services Administration.",
      "\"I want to make sure -- you had no trouble getting into this building today?\" Howell asked.",
      "\"Your point ... is a really good one,\" Butswinkas answered. \"They are in charge of access to courthouses ... I mean, I hardly have to explain the colossal damage that that rule, that restriction imposed on one law firm and no other, is for their ability to practice their profession.\"",

    "summary": "A judge on Wednesday signaled that she was deeply skeptical that the Pentagon's handling of transgender service members complies with federal law.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon's new transgender service member policy faces its first legal test.",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday signaled that she was deeply skeptical that the Pentagon's handling of transgender service members complies with federal law, grilling a government attorney for hours about the scientific basis for the decision, its impact on military readiness, and the alleged harms to unit cohesion.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said she plans to issue a ruling on the policy as early as next week, but appeared to rebuff most of the arguments defending the policy made by a DOJ attorney, who frequently appeared to be at a loss for words regarding how to respond to the judge's questions.",
      "The Pentagon's new policy to separate transgender U.S. service members from the military is facing its first legal test as Judge Reyes considers issuing an order blocking the policy from taking effect.",
      "\"Let's just use the Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth's own words: Transgender people lack warrior ethos, are liars, lack integrity, are not humble, are selfish and can't meet physical mental fitness requirements,\" Judge Reyes said during Wednesday's hearing. \"You would agree with me that calling people liars and lacking integrity and not able to meet rigorous standards for discipline is insulting -- yes or no, or you can't say?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" the attorney responded, arguing that Trump's executive order and Hegseth's directive don't use that exact language.",
      "\"So, people with gender dysphoria can't be honest, humble, or have integrity. You think that's demeaning to people with gender dysphoria?\" Judge Reyes later asked.",
      "\"I can't answer that question,\" the attorney responded.",
      "Judge Reyes similarly pressed the government to explain the Pentagon's concerns about transgender soldiers facing a higher risk of suicidal ideation, saying the government fundamentally misunderstood the studies that were cited to defend the policy. At one point in the hearing, she considered ordering the attorneys to read the studies, which the attorneys admitted they had never read.",
      "\"Do you know why people with transgender, with gender dysphoria, have higher rates of suicide ideation?\" she asked. \"It's because they face such stigma and discrimination in society. All the studies show that transgender people and people with gender dysphoria are not more inherently subject to suicide or likely to have suicide ideation. That's not it. It's not biological, it's not inherent.\"",
      "\"I assume you would agree with me with the following: The answer to suicide ideation caused by discrimination is not further discrimination, right?\" the judge asked.",
      "An attorney for the DOJ responded by arguing that while military leadership has addressed the treatment of transgender soldiers differently over the years, the court should trust the Defense Department to know what's best for its soldiers.",
      "\"That is a policy choice that is for the military to make, and it's something to which this Court should defer,\" he said.",
      "Earlier during the hearing, Judge Reyes said that the government \"egregiously misquoted\" and \"cherry picked\" scientific studies to incorrectly assert that transgender soldiers decrease the readiness and lethality of the military.",
      "She also repeatedly suggested that the policy unfairly targets a class of people that the Trump administration dislikes.",
      "\"The question in this case is whether the military under the equal protection rights afforded to every American under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, if the military ... can do that and targeting a specific medical issue that impacts a specific group that the administration disfavors,\" she said.",
      "Judge Reyes also pressed a DOJ attorney to identify any other similar medical issues that has prompted a similar response from the Department of Defense.",
      "\"Identify for me a single other time in recent history where the military has excluded a group of people for having a disqualifying issue, because I can't think of one,\" Judge Reyes asked.",
      "The attorney answered that the military applied a similar policy for soldiers who declined to take the COVID-19 vaccine, prompting an incredulous Judge Reyes to ask anyone in the gallery to raise their hand if they had gotten COVID.",
      "\"Lots of people raise their hands, right?\" Judge Reyes said. \"All different kinds of people ... so it wasn't just aimed at getting rid of one group of people.\"",
      "The plaintiffs have argued that the DOD's policy -- which was finalized in late February and bans most transgender service members from serving with some exceptions -- violates the Fifth Amendment's right to equal protection and causes irreparable harm by denigrating transgender soldiers, disrupting unit cohesion and weakening the military.",
      "\"This case is a test of the core democratic principle that makes our country worth defending -- that every person is of equal dignity and worth and is entitled to equal protection of the laws,\" the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice have defended the policy by arguing the court should not intervene in military decision-making, describing gender dysphoria as a condition that causes \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of human functioning.\"",
      "\"DoD has been particularly cautious about service by individuals with mental health conditions, given the unique mental and emotional stresses of military service,\" government lawyers argued.",
      "During a hearing last month, Judge Reyes -- a Biden appointee who was the first LGBT judge on the D.C. District Court -- signaled deep skepticism with the government's claim that transgender service members lessen the military's lethality or readiness, though she declined to intervene until the DOD finalized their policy.",
      "When the policy was formalized last month, she quickly ordered the government to clarify key tenets of their policy, including identifying what \"mental health constraint\" other than gender dysphoria that conflicts with the military's standards of \"honesty, humility, and integrity.\"",
      "She also raised doubts about the government's claims about the exceptions to the policy, flagging on the court's docket a recent DOD social media post that \"transgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\"",
      "The hearing comes amid an increasingly hostile relationship between Judge Reyes and the Department of Justice.",
      "After Judge Reyes excoriated a DOJ lawyer last month during a hearing in the case, the Department of Justice filed a complaint with an appeals judge about what they alleged was Reyes' \"hostile and egregious misconduct.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle alleged that Reyes demonstrated a political bias, compromised the dignity of the proceedings and inappropriately questioned a DOJ attorney about his religious beliefs.",
      "\"At minimum, this matter warrants further investigation to determine whether these incidents represent a pattern of misconduct that requires more significant remedial measures,\" Mizelle wrote.",

    "story": [
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin rolled out over two dozen policy announcements.",
      "Calling it the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,\" the Environmental Protection Agency rolled out sweeping moves Wednesday aimed at walking back environmental protections and eliminating a host of climate change regulations, some decades in the making.",
      "Taken together, the agency's actions indicate a wholesale reorientation of the agency away from government support of renewable energy, carbon reduction programs and air, water and soil regulations while threatening to gut the government's past scientific findings at the core of most climate regulations.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin rolled out over two dozen policy announcements, through a series of press releases and public statements. The list of proposed changes includes rolling back emission regulations on coal, oil and gas production and a promise to work across the federal agencies to reevaluate the government finding that determined that greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, not only heat the planet but are a threat to public health.",
      "\"We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,\" Zeldin wrote in a statement on EPA's website.",
      "The backlash from the environmental community was swift.",
      "\"If they get their way, they will wreck our air, our water, burn down our homes, and hand future generations an unlivable climate. From moms in the 1970s who wanted their kids to be able to play outside without getting asthma to young people in the 2020s who went on hunger strike to force Congress to pass a climate bill, generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed for these regulations,\" the youth-led climate advocacy group Sunrise Movement wrote in response.",
      "\"Corporate polluters are celebrating today because Trump's EPA just handed them a free pass to spew unlimited climate pollution, consequences be damned. The Biden administration put the first-ever carbon limits on dirty coal and gas plants, cutting toxic air pollution, saving lives, and avoiding $270 billion in climate damages. Rolling back these protections is a direct attack on the communities that have been forced to breathe toxic air from polluting plants for decades,\" climate advocacy organization Evergreen Action Senior Power Sector Policy Lead Charles Harper wrote in a statement.",
      "Changes to the rules and regulations announced Wednesday will still have to go through the federal regulatory process and will likely have to stand up to numerous court challenges from environmental groups. However, today's flurry of actions makes good on the president's campaign promises to gut many of the long-established rules and regulations initially created to protect our water, air, soil and human health.",
      "Endangerment finding",
      "One of the most significant announcements was that the EPA would engage in the\"formal reconsideration\" of the agency's endangerment finding.",
      "In 2009, the EPA issued an \"endangerment finding\" determining that greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and others, pose a danger to public health and the environment. This ruling, prompted by the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, gave the EPA the legal authority to regulate these emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA).",
      "This finding represents the legal underpinning for many regulations concerning greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions standards for vehicles, power plants and oil and gas production \u2014 all of which Zeldin said the agency would also reevaluate as it reconsiders the finding.",
      "If the Trump Administration decides the endangerment finding is no longer applicable and that determination survives court challenges, 16 years' worth of emissions regulations, including those enacted under President Biden, could be jeopardized.",
      "Vehicle emissions standards",
      "Zeldin also took aim at Biden-era vehicle standards, saying the EPA would terminate the tailpipe emissions regulations announced by the previous administration last year.",
      "While the Trump Administration has repeatedly referred to these standards as an EV \"mandate\", there was no such mandate put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "The Biden Environmental Protection Agency implemented tailpipe emissions standards last March that established an average of allowed emissions across a vehicle manufacturer's entire fleet of offered vehicles. The standards would have only impacted cars from model years 2027 to 2032 and allowed for a range of usable technologies, including fully electric cars, hybrids and improved internal combustion engines. These standards applied to light and medium-duty vehicles. A separate set of standards were released for heavy-duty vehicles.",
      "As Zeldin's EPA announced reconsideration of these standards, it released a statement saying, the regulations imposed, \"$700 billion in regulatory and compliance costs,\" alleging they took away, \"Americans' ability to choose a safe and affordable car for their family and increases the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "Impacts on coal",
      "Another of the policies being reconsidered is the \"Clean Power Plan 2.0,\" which targets emissions from coal and natural gas power plants.",
      "At the time, the agency claimed the new regulations would represent a massive reduction in pollution and save hundreds of billions of dollars in climate and public health costs as it would force power plants to control 90% of their carbon pollution through methods like carbon capture and tightened the emissions standards for toxic metals like mercury that are released from coal-fired plants.",
      "In one of many press releases sent on Wednesday, the EPA called the rules \"overreaching\" and \"an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country's reliance on foreign forms of energy.\"",
      "Social cost of carbon",
      "Also among the 31 actions announced by the agency is a revisiting of the \"social cost of carbon,\" with Zeldin saying the previous administration used the metric to \"advance their climate agenda in a way that imposed major costs.\"",
      "In 2010, the EPA under then-President Barack Obama released its first estimate for what it called the \"social cost of carbon,\" or SC-CO2. This metric meant to capture in dollars the long-term damage created by carbon dioxide emissions each year.",
      "It estimated, in effect, the cost of damages related to climate change, including changes in agricultural productivity, human health, property damages from added flood risk, changes in energy costs and other considerations.",
      "The Biden Administration later updated the estimate process to include consideration of additional factors, leading to an increase in the national SC-CO2. In December 2023, the Biden EPA updated the metric at a dramatically higher rate \u2014 $190 per ton of carbon, compared to the administration's earlier estimate of $51 per ton.",
      "\"To Power the Great American Comeback, we are fully committed to removing regulations holding back the U.S.,\" Zeldin said in the announcement.",

      "A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday that it had measured during recent overflights \u201csignificantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\u201d and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\u201d the observatory said in a statement. \u201cSuch stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\u201d",
      "It is an 11,070-foot (3,374-meter) tall, ice- and snow-covered volcano roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents.",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "However, \u201cIt is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\u201d John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world\u2019s busiest cargo hubs.",

He died at a triage and treatment area, and an improvised weapon was found. He was serving time for carrying a concealed bladed weapon and for a subsequent prison assault.",
      "And hours later German M. Merino, 37, died after he was attacked by two inmates in Kern Valley State Prison, authorities said. He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.",
      "Prison violence is a longstanding problem as people serving life sentences have little to lose.",
      "In January, for example, Mario Campbell, 36, was attacked on the main exercise yard at the Sacramento prison by two inmates serving live with the possibility of parole, according to corrections officials. He died at a medical facility about an hour and a half later, and officers found three improvised weapons.",
      "The restrictions will stay in place until the investigation is completed. It\u2019s unclear how long that could take.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Egg prices again reached a record high in February, as the bird flu continues to run rampant and Easter and Passover approach.",
      "The latest monthly Consumer Price Index showed a dozen Grade A eggs cost an average of $5.90 in U.S. cities in February, up 10.4% from a year ago. That eclipsed January's record-high price of $4.95.",
      "Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 166 million birds, mostly were egg-laying chickens. Just since the start of the year, more than 30 million egg layers have been killed.",

      "The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year\u2019s average of $3.17 per dozen.",
      "But there may be light at the end of the tunnel. The USDA reported last week that egg shortages are easing and wholesale prices are dropping, which might provide relief on the retail side before this year\u2019s late Easter, which is three weeks later than last year. It said there had been no major bird flu outbreak for two weeks.",
      "\u201cShoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,\u201d the USDA wrote in the March 7 report.",
      "David Anderson, a professor and extension economist for livestock and food marketing at Texas A&M University, said wholesale figures dropping is a good sign that prices could go down as shoppers react to the high prices by buying fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cWhat that should tell us is things are easing a little bit in terms of prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo going forward, the next CPI report may very well indicate falling egg prices.\u201d",

      "\u201cRecord high prices is a market signal to producers to produce more, but it takes time to be able to produce more, and we just haven\u2019t had enough time for that to happen yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s going to take some more months to get there.\u201d",
      "Advocacy groups and others have also called for a probe into whether egg producers have used the avian flu to price gouge. But egg producers say the avian flu is solely behind the elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, restaurants have added surcharges and made other changes to offset the cost of eggs.",
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to combat bird flu, $500 million investment to help farmers bolster biosecurity measures, $400 million in additional aid for farmers whose flocks have been impacted by avian flu, $100 million to research and potentially develop vaccines and therapeutics for U.S. chicken flocks. But it will likely take a while for that plan to make an impact."

      "\u201cWe are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America\u2019s Golden Age,'' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in an essay in the Wall Street Journal.",
      "His actions will eliminate trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and \u201chidden taxes,\u201d Zeldin said, lowering the cost of living for American families and reducing prices for such essentials such as buying a car, heating your home and operating a business.",
      "\u201cOur actions will also reignite American manufacturing, spreading economic benefits to communities,\" Zeldin wrote.",
      "In all, Zeldin said he is rolling back 31 environmental rules, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change.",
      "Zeldin said he and President Donald Trump support rewriting the agency\u2019s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The Obama-era determination under the Clean Air Act is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.",

      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",
      "\u201cIf I'd been born a rich man,\u201d he said. Starr added: \u201cWe\u2019re just regular people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",
      "It's the position several hundred other affordable-housing projects now find themselves in across 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cIn all honesty,\u201d said Michelle Arevalos, Smith Tower's administrator, \u201cif this building were not here, a lot of our folks actually probably would be homeless.\u201d",

      "A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former Sen. Brian Kelsey announced that he received a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24. A federal database said Kelsey was no longer in Bureau of Prisons custody as of Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMay God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\u201d Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \u201cGod used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\u201d referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \u201cunsure heart and a confused mind.\u201d He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn\u2019t understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey\u2019s challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \u201cunconditional admission of guilt\u201d under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he announced the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \u201ccooperate fully and truthfully.\u201d He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey\u2019s state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey\u2019s 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey\u2019s campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn\u2019t seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

      "But First Amendment advocates say they've never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in Trump's second term.",
      "Trump's Republican administration has threatened Democratic members of Congress with investigation for criticizing conservatives, pulled federal grants that include language it opposes, sanctioned law firms that represent Trump's political opponents and arrested the organizer of student protests that Trump criticized as \u201canti-Semitic, anti-American.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour right to say something depends on what the administration thinks of it, which is no free speech at all,\u201d said Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group.",
      "Trump on Monday took credit for the arrest by immigration agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests there. Khalil's lawyers say the government is targeting him for his activism and to \u201cdiscriminate against particular viewpoints.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration will revoke the visas or green cards of supporters of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization, \"so they can be deported.\u201d The government has not yet filed documents specifying why Khalil was detained, and a federal judge earlier this week ordered immigration officials not to remove Khalil from the country while his case is sorted out.",
      "Trump supporters, including members of Congress, have argued that because Khalil is not a U.S. citizen, the government can target him for his speech, which they contend amounts to sympathy for terrorism.",
      "\u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Even some Trump allies were uncomfortable with that approach: \u201cThere's almost no one I don't want to deport,\u201d wrote conservative commentator Ann Coulter on X, \u201cbut, unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the first amendment?\u201d",
      "On the other end of the political spectrum, activists who organized to protest the war in Gaza were aghast at the administration's move.",
      "\u201cWe learn about our First Amendment rights since we\u2019re children,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of Stanford University's Students for Justice in Palestine. \u201cBut that is very much a myth. It\u2019s not the reality we live in right now. And it\u2019s scary.\u201d",
      "Prior to the arrest of Khalil over the weekend, the administration pressured Columbia University to crack down on anti-Israel activism among students and faculty, and Trump has threatened to go after any college that supports protests he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "He also issued an order forbidding federal funding of what his administration labels diversity, equity and inclusion, which led to a freeze on federal grants as the administration reviews them for forbidden words such as \u201cgender.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, which sued the Trump administration over its DEI ban and won an injunction against it from a federal judge, said the administration is pulling funding from projects that have prohibited words, yanking grants from research into such areas as crop diversity or differences in infant mortality in urban and rural areas.",
      "\u201cNobody really wants Big Brother telling you what you can research,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThese are questions our country needs to know the answers to.\u201d",
      "Republicans for several years have been the party complaining about infringements on the First Amendment, from complaints about \u201cwoke\u201d colleges canceling conservative speakers to bashing social media companies they accuse of censoring conservative viewpoints, including cutting Trump off after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol. GOP-controlled Florida and Texas even drew up laws to limit how social media firms regulate content, though the U.S. Supreme Court kept them on hold last year because of possible First Amendment violations.",
      "Last year, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the First Amendment during his campaign, and he signed an executive order just hours after being sworn into office prohibiting anyone in the federal government from interfering with Americans' free speech rights. But he also made pledges that signaled he might oppose some of the First Amendment's fundamental protections, such as deporting foreign students who protested Israel or outlawing flag-burning, which the Supreme Court has ruled is protected free speech.",
      "Creeley, of the individual rights foundation, said he tried to be optimistic before Trump took office that the new president would fix some First Amendment issues. Instead, he said, it's gotten worse.",
      "\u201cI cannot recall anything like this,\" Creeley said. \"I've been defending First Amendment rights since 2006, and this is the most serious of threats I can recall.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also has gone after the news media.",
      "The president has sued several outlets for coverage he dislikes, and his appointees at the Federal Communications Commission have helped pressure those media companies. Meanwhile, Trump's FCC is opening investigations of other media companies with which Trump has feuded, and the administration has barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool because it won't use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. The AP is suing to restore its access on First Amendment grounds.",
      "The administration also has targeted law firms for their affiliations with Democrats or the previous administration. It stripped security clearances for lawyers at a firm that helped special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump during President Joe Biden's administration and Perkins Coie, a longtime Democratic firm that Trump blames for the investigation into his campaign's relationship with Russia during his first term. On Tuesday, Perkins Coie sued the administration to reverse the action, saying it violated the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.",
      "Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, said the attacks on the law firms have scared some high-profile attorneys out of taking cases that challenge the administration, which, he contended, is the point.",
      "\u201cThere's a long tradition of lawyers taking on controversial clients, sometimes against our government,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear it will retaliate against lawyers.\u201d",
      "Jaffer said attacks on free speech and association are intended to chill dissent by convincing people in the opposition that they could become targets.",
      "\u201cAll of us are able to participate in government by engaging in protest,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cWhen the government shuts down that kind of speech, it's shutting down democracy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has even targeted members of Congress.",
      "Trump appointed Ed Martin, a defense attorney who represented some of those charged in the Jan. 6 attack, as acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia. Martin wrote to Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and one of the nation's top Democrats, telling him that a comment he made in 2020 warning conservative Supreme Court judges they would \u201cpay the price\u201d for overturning the right to abortion could be seen as a threat. Schumer has since apologized for the statement.",
      "Martin also wrote to Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, warning him that comments he made about Trump adviser Elon Musk could be seen as a threat. Garcia had said Democrats should \u201cbring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cMembers of Congress must have the right to forcefully oppose the Trump Administration,\" Garcia replied on Musk\u2019s X platform. \"I will not be silenced.\u201d",

      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has pledged to start paying out tens of billions in aid to victims of Hurricane Helene later this month",
      "ATLANTA -- Tens of billions in aid for victims of Hurricane Helene should start flowing later this month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pledged Wednesday, but delays are already making it hard this year for some farmers to plant crops.",
      "Congress set a deadline of March 21 to hand out the money when it passed a $100 billion disaster relief package on Dec. 21. The late September storm cut a swath from Florida's Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.",
      "The National Centers for Environmental Information says Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths.",
      "At a news conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, Rollins pledged the aid would begin to be disbursed before the deadline.",
      "\u201cThat money will begin to move in the next few weeks,\" she said.",
      "That's not a moment too soon for Chris Hopkins, who farms near Lyons in south Georgia. Helene wiped out half the cotton Hopkins was growing on 1,400 acres (560 hectares). He said Tuesday that he began planting 300 acres (121 hectares) of corn this month, and plans to start planting cotton in late April.",
      "Hopkins said the big losses forced him to dip into emergency reserve funds to pay off $200,000 in 2024 loans for seed, fertilizer and other materials. Some neighboring farmers hit hard by the storm still have unpaid debts from last year, he said, leaving them unable to borrow more to start planting 2025 crops.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s desperately needed,\u201d Hopkins said of federal aid. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that producers are almost in a holding or pause pattern because they can\u2019t afford to pay their rent or their loans.\u201d",
      "Hopkins said farmers had hoped the money would come sooner, in January or February, so they could pay off creditors before planting season. He said some have sold equipment or even land to generate enough cash to get new crops started.",
      "\u201cThe general consensus in the farming and ag community is that it would have been much better earlier,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAg producers are thankful for it by all means. But taking the full 90 days to get it is tough.\u201d",
      "In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders decided to wait to approve Helene damage relief money in the state\u2019s regular budget instead of an emergency bill in part because they expected federal officials to get relief money out quickly.",
      "Most but not all of the disaster relief bill is earmarked for Helene. It includes $21 billion to help farmers, $8 billion to rebuild damaged roads and highways, $12 billion in grants to help communities and individuals recover and $2.2 billion in low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners.",
      "Officials have estimated that Helene caused property and economic damage to the agriculture sector totaling $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.",
      "Beyond the cotton crop, the storm toppled pecan trees and flattened chicken houses in Georgia. Farming in western North Carolina is dominated by specialty crops including Christmas trees and nursery plants, with fewer growers covered by crop insurance.",
      "South Carolina officials estimated $620 million in agriculture damage in 2024, not just from Helene, but also from other weather disasters.",
      "State governments have been moving to expand their aid packages. Georgia has earmarked $285 million for low-interest loans for farmers and removing downed timber from private land in an amended budget that Gov. Brian Kemp signed last week, part of $862 million in Helene-related spending.",
      "North Carolina lawmakers are negotiating the details of a supplemental Helene relief bill that may total more than $500 million, in part to provide more funds for crop losses. It would be North Carolina\u2019s fourth Helene aid package to be enacted. The state has requested close to $1.9 billion from the disaster relief law approved by Congress in December. Most of that money would go to address crop and timber losses, debris removal, stream restoration and erosion.",
      "The South Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a budget that includes $220 million in Helene relief for farmers and others as a match to money from the federal government. They also set aside $50 million to give to the state Department of Transportation to pay back what they spent repairing roads and clearing trees.",

      "President Donald Trump welcomed Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on Wednesday for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration at the White House, where he added Ireland to the list of countries he says are taking advantage of the United States.",
      "Martin countered by noting Ireland's contributions to the U.S.",
      "It was Trump's first Oval Office meeting with a foreign leader since his recent sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which morphed into a shouting match as they jousted over ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The session ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave the White House.",
      "Martin, who offered only gentle pushback to some of Trump's comments, is set to return to the White House in the evening to present Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at an early St. Patrick's Day celebration. The duo also attended an annual luncheon at the Capitol.",
      "The president's banter during the Oval Office meeting also touched on Vice President JD Vance's shamrock-themed socks and Trump nemesis Rosie O\u2019Donnell 's recent move to Ireland.",
      "The Republican president has been sparring with U.S. allies and adversaries alike over trade, slapping double-digit tariffs on imports from countries from Canada to China and in between. During the appearance with Martin, Trump repeated his claim that the European Union was created just to stick it to the U.S.",
      "Asked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, \u201cof course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn\u2019t have let it happen.\u201d He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country's tax policies.",
      "\u201cWe had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn\u2019t have a clue or let\u2019s say they weren\u2019t businesspeople, but they didn\u2019t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,\" Trump said.",
      "Martin countered that the trade relationship is \u201ca two-way street,\u201d adding that Ireland's two largest airlines buy more aircrafts from Boeing Co. than anyone else outside of America.",
      "More than 700 Irish companies are also based in America, creating thousands of jobs, Martin said. \u201cThat's a little known fact that doesn't turn up in the statistics,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cI understand where you're coming from, fully,\u201d Martin told Trump, \u201cbut I think it's a relationship that we can develop and that will endure into the future.\u201d",
      "At one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S.",
      "\u201cBy the way, I love these socks. What\u2019s with these socks? I\u2019m trying to stay focused, but I\u2019m very impressed with the VP\u2019s socks,\u201d Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room.",
      "Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin's visit.",
      "When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let O'Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening.",
      "\u201cI like that question,\u201d the president said, adding that Martin was \u201dbetter off not knowing\u201d about O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell, a comedian and former talk-show host, and Trump have feuded for years. O\u2019Donnell, who is gay, recently announced that she moved to Ireland in January, citing a lack of equal rights in America.",
      "Trump found a way to sneak his penchant for professional fighting into the discourse.",
      "As the meeting wrapped, Trump was asked to name his favorite person in Ireland. Trump referred to Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, partly because \"he's got the best tattoos I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Trump is well known for his support of Ultimate Fighting Championship and attended bouts during the 2024 presidential campaign.",

      "A 37-year-old man has died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- A 37-year-old man died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area, according to local authorities and a spokesperson for Red Lodge Mountain.",
      "The man was riding alone in a three-person chair that carries skiers up the mountain when he fell from an unspecified height, according to Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks. The accident happened Monday just before noon at the ski area southeast of Billings in the Beartooth Mountains.",
      "Jeffrey Zinne of Billings was taken to a Billings hospital where he was pronounced dead early Wednesday from injuries suffered in the fall, according to Carbon County Sheriff Josh McQuillan and Rich Hoffman with the Yellowstone County Coroner's Office.",
      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 mph (80.4 kph) were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "Zinne, who had been snowboarding on Monday prior to his accident, was married with a 2-year-old son and owned the Montana Air Cartage freight hauling company, according to a post on a GoFundMe fundraising site set up on his family\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cHe was more than just a boss for many people here. He was a friend, a mentor,\u201d said Jessice Sande, a manager at Montana Air Cartage who recalled Zinne's infectious laugh.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at Colorado's Vail resort after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe."

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch is losing nearly half its staff in the Trump administration\u2019s layoffs, effectively gutting an office that already faced a backlog of thousands of complaints from students and families across the nation.",
      "Among a total of more than 1,300 layoffs announced Tuesday were roughly 240 in the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, according to a list obtained and verified by The Associated Press. Seven of the civil rights agency's 12 regional offices were entirely laid off, including busy hubs in New York, Chicago and Dallas. Despite assurances that the department's work will continue unaffected, huge numbers of cases appear to be in limbo.",
      "The Trump administration has not said how it will proceed with thousands of cases being handled by staff it's eliminating. The cases involve families trying to get school services for students with disabilities, allegations of bias related to race and religion, and complaints over sexual violence at schools and college campuses.",
      "Some staffers who remain said there's no way to pick up all of their fired colleagues\u2019 cases. Many were already struggling to keep pace with their own caseloads. With fewer than 300 workers, families likely will be waiting on resolution for years, they said.",
      "\u201cI fear they won\u2019t get their calls answered, their complaints won\u2019t move,\u201d said Michael Pillera, a senior civil rights attorney for the Office for Civil Rights. \u201cI truly don\u2019t understand how a handful of offices could handle the entire country.\u201d",
      "Department officials insisted the cuts will not affect civil rights investigations. The reductions were \u201cstrategic decisions,\" spokesperson Madison Biedermann.",
      "\u201cOCR will be able to deliver the work,\u201d Biedermann said. \u201cIt will have to look different, and we know that.\u201d",
      "The layoffs are part of a dramatic downsizing directed by President Donald Trump as he moves to reduce the footprint of the federal government.",
      "Trump has pushed for a full shutdown of the Education Department, calling it a \u201ccon job\u201d and saying its power should be turned over to states. On Wednesday he told reporters many agency employees \u201cdon\u2019t work at all.\u201d Responding to the layoffs, he said his administration is \u201ckeeping the best ones.\u201d",
      "After the cuts, the Office for Civil Rights will only have workers in Washington and five regional offices, which traditionally take the lead on investigating complaints and mediating resolutions with schools and colleges. Buildings are being closed and staff laid off in Dallas, Chicago, New York, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia and San Francisco.",
      "Many lawyers at the New York City office were juggling 80 or more cases, said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for reprisals. The branch often mediated cases with New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest district, and its lawyers were handling a high-profile antisemitism investigation at Columbia University \u2014 a priority for President Donald Trump.",
      "The staffer described several pending cases involving students with disabilities who are wrongly being kept out of school because of behavioral issues. With limited oversight from the office, they said, school districts will be less likely to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Pillera, who had said before the cuts that he was leaving the department, said it's unclear how complaints will be investigated in areas that no longer have offices.",
      "\u201cWe have to physically go to schools,\u201d Pillera said. \u201cWe have to look at the playground to see if it\u2019s accessible for kids with disabilities. We have to measure doorways and bathrooms to see if everything is accessible for kids with disabilities.\u201d",
      "Even before the layoffs, the civil rights office had been losing staff even as complaints rose to record levels. The workforce had fallen below 600 staffers before Trump took office, and they faced nearly 23,000 complaints filed last year, more than ever.",
      "Trump officials ordered a freeze on most cases when they arrived at the department, adding to the backlog. When Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze last week, there were more than 20,000 pending cases.",
      "Historically, most of the office\u2019s work deals with disability rights cases, but it has fielded growing numbers of complaints alleging discrimination based on sex or race. It has also played a prominent role in investigating complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia amid the Israel-Hamas war and a wave of campus demonstrations that spread across the country last year.",
      "Craig Trainor, Trump\u2019s appointee over the office, directed staff to focus on antisemitism cases as a top priority last week. In a memo, he accused former President Joe Biden of failing to hold colleges accountable and promised tougher action against violators.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said the goal is not to defund key programs but to make them operate more efficiently. She vowed to uphold the agency\u2019s civil rights work but said it might fit better being moved to the Justice Department.",
      "An email the Education Department sent to all staff after the layoffs said there will need to be significant changes to how they work.",
      "\u201cWhat we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition,\u201d the message said.",

      "Although only 9 months old and still reliant on her mother's milk, Pepper has become the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium's most acrobatic sea lion, said Noelle Tremonti, a staff biologist for the aquarium.",

      "The dizzying circles performed in Tacoma, Washington, about 34 miles (55 kilometers) south of Seattle, last month are part of the sea lion\u2019s many enrichment activities. The strips help the pup learn how to interact with kelp, which it would be around a lot in its natural environment, and how to explore its environment using its mouth, said Tremonti.",
      "The strip, which is made out of heavy duty felt material, is just small enough for Pepper to grab and manipulate, said Tremonti. In the video, the sea lion pulls it with its flipper while chasing the tail end to create the graceful circles and later clamps down on the strip with its mouth.",
      "Pepper was the first sea lion born at the aquarium in its 120-year history. Now 74 pounds (33.5 kilograms), it recently ate its first fish, although it mostly just likes to play with them.",
      "But the playful and inquisitive sea lion's favorite activity is flipping around with kelp strips.",
      "\u201cShe will dedicate a good portion of her day to finding different things to do with the kelp strips,\u201d said Tremonti. \"It\u2019s really fun to watch.\u201d"

      "The mayor of Wisconsin's capital city has placed the municipal clerk on leave as investigators work to determine how almost 200 ballots in the November election went uncounted",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The mayor of Wisconsin's capital city said Wednesday she has placed the municipal clerk on leave as investigators work to determine how she failed to count almost 200 absentee ballots in the November election.",
      "Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said in a statement that the city has launched an investigation and that she needed to suspend City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl to maintain public confidence in the clerk\u2019s office. The mayor added that the city will spare no expense to ensure every vote is counted heading into the swing state's spring election. The state Elections Commission also is investigating whether Witzel-Behl violated any state laws or abused her discretion.",
      "The uncounted ballots did not change the results of any races but four Madison voters whose ballots weren\u2019t counted filed claims last week for $175,000 each from the city and Dane County, the first step toward initiating a lawsuit.",
      "No listing for Witzel-Behl's personal contact information could be immediately found.",
      "The suspension comes with the state's April 1 general election just weeks away. The highest-profile race is between conservative Brad Schimel and liberal Susan Crawford for an open state Supreme Court seat. The outcome will determine the ideological balance of the court as it ponders cases involving abortion, the strength of public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries. Early voting begins next week.",
      "Rhodes-Conway said in her statement that she has appointed City Attorney Michael Haas as interim city clerk and that she expects he will ensure the election runs smoothly in Madison. Haas has previously worked as administrator and attorney for the state elections commission.",
      "According to commission investigators, Wiztel-Behl\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed absentee ballots in a courier bag that had been placed in a security cart. The discovery came on Nov. 12, seven days after the election, while county workers were conducting the official count of election results.",
      "Witzel-Behl said she told two employees to notify the elections commission, but neither did. A third city worker visited the Dane County Clerk\u2019s Office to inform officials there, but that employee said the county didn\u2019t want the ballots for the count, known as a canvass. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell has said he knew nothing of the uncounted ballots until they were reported in the media.",
      "Witzel-Behl\u2019s office found another 125 uncounted absentee ballots in a sealed courier bag in a supply tote on Dec. 2. According to commission investigators, Witzel-Behl said she didn\u2019t inform county canvassers because the canvass was finished. She added that based on the county\u2019s response to the Nov. 12 discovery she didn\u2019t think the county would be interested.",
      "The commission wasn\u2019t notified of either discovery until Dec. 18. Witzel-Behl told investigators that the employees she asked to notify the commission waited until reconciliation was completed. That\u2019s a routine process in which poll workers and elections officials ensure an election\u2019s accuracy, including checking the number of ballots issued at the polls against the number of voters. She couldn\u2019t explain why she didn\u2019t contact county officials or the elections commission herself, according to the investigators.",
      "The elections commission was expected to approve guidelines during a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday to help clerks around the state ensure they count every ballot in the spring election.",
      "The recommendations include thoroughly documenting any incidents on election day; making sure all materials are returned from the polling sites; checking voting equipment\u2019s ballot bins for anything that might have been missed; and immediately reporting any mistakes to county officials and the commission."

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Prosecutors have requested a mental evaluation for a former Kentucky sheriff charged with gunning down a judge in a courthouse last year after his attorneys said they will argue he was emotionally disturbed at the time of the shooting.",
      "The killing rocked the small Appalachian community of Whitesburg, where residents knew Shawn \u201cMickey\u201d Stines to be longtime friends with District Judge Kevin Mullins. Prosecutors have presented a video in court of a man police identified as Stines pulling out a handgun and shooting Mullins at his desk on Sept. 19.",

      "Investigators have not announced a motive for the shooting. Earlier that day, the two men had met for lunch with several other people near the courthouse, police said.",
      "Attorneys for Stines wrote in a motion earlier this month that they plan to present evidence that the ex-lawman suffered from insanity and \u201cextreme emotional disturbance\u201d at the time he allegedly shot Mullins. Stines\u2019 attorneys said they would not raise the issue of whether Stines is mentally fit to stand trial.",
      "\u201cWhile further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the mental health evidence ultimately presented, it is our strong belief that our client was operating under extreme pressure that significantly impacted his mental state,\u201d Stines\u2019 attorney Kerri Bartley said in an emailed statement.",
      "Stines remains jailed without bond. At a January hearing, special judge Chris Cohron said he would take up the issue of Stines\u2019 bond at a later hearing. He has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder of a public official and resigned days after the shooting."

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's administration Wednesday from enforcing portions of an executive order designed to punish a prominent law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into ties between the Republican candidate and Russia.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington granted a temporary restraining order sought by the firm, Perkins Coie, one day after it alleged in a federal lawsuit that it's illegally being targeted because of its legal work. The judge said the president's action sends a chilling message that lawyers can be punished for representing clients or advancing views unfavorable to the administration.",
      "\u201cSuch a circumstance threatens the very foundation of or legal system,\" said Howell, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cOur justice system is based on the fundamental belief that justice works best when all parties have zealous advocates.\u201d",
      "The order came during an extraordinary court hearing in which Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, defended the latest in a series of retributive moves targeting the president\u2019s perceived adversaries.",
      "Mizelle, who's also serving as the acting associate attorney general, argued that the president has the clear authority to take action against entities he believes present a threat to national security. It\u2019s highly unusual for such a high-ranking Justice Department official to argue on behalf of the government in the trial court.",
      "Perkins Coie says it's already suffering financial consequences of the order, which calls for limiting firm employees' access to federal buildings and terminating any government contacts of its clients. The judge's temporary restraining order doesn't block the administration from enforcing another provision that seeks to strip Perkins Coie attorneys of security clearances.",
      "Perkins Coie says all 15 of its top clients have government contracts, and several clients have already ended their legal arrangements with the firm or threatened to do so. Dane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie, said keeping the order in place will \u201cspell the end of the law firm.\u201d",
      "Perkins Coie represented the 2016 presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s opponent, and also represented Democrats in a variety of voting rights challenges during the 2020 election.",

That firm, Fusion GPS, subsequently retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who researched whether Trump and Russia had suspicious ties.",

      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014",
      "Days after Donald Trump was elected to a second term, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs headed to the Mexican border with a conciliatory message.",
      "\u201cBorder security was a core issue of the Trump campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to having conversations with the incoming president about Arizona\u2019s needs.\u201d",
      "Back in Phoenix, Attorney General Kris Mayes was plotting a legal strategy that has led so far to five lawsuits against the Trump administration, on average one every 10 days since she took office.",
      "Both Hobbs and Mayes are Democrats who will seek reelection next year in a state that went for Trump. But they have adopted sharply different approaches to handling Trump\u2019s return to the White House: Restrained and collaborative for Hobbs; hardened and embattled for Mayes.",
      "The strategies encapsulate the debate consuming Democrats around the country trying to find a path back to power. In winning over working class voters, Trump scrambled political allegiances and left Democrats struggling to piece together a viable coalition.",
      "Arizona's two top elected officials are making different bets about what voters will be looking for next year. Hobbs and Mayes both narrowly won their offices in 2022. Mayes\u2019 280-vote victory was the closest in state history, and Hobbs won by less than 1 percentage point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can yield to authoritarian, anti-democratic behavior when it\u2019s in the White House and when our country is in as much danger as it is right now,\u201d Mayes said in a recent interview. \u201cOur country has never been in this much peril since the Civil War.\u201d",
      "Hobbs declined an interview request. Her team issued a memo last week saying Arizona voters would see she \u201cis serious about putting partisan politics aside to get things done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey see her work with the Trump Administration and Republican Legislature when they share common goals, and they see her stand up to far-right proposals when they are out of touch with Arizona,\u201d wrote Nicole DeMont, the governor\u2019s chief political strategist.",
      "The disparate approaches owe somewhat to their differing roles. As governor, Hobbs has to work with a Trump-friendly Republican legislature and may need to cajole the White House for federal assistance during Trump\u2019s presidency. As attorney general, Mayes has the prerogative to fight in court.",
      "Mayes is also prosecuting Trump aides and allies involved in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "The dynamic is much the same in Michigan, another battleground state Trump won narrowly, where Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is aggressively confronting the Trump administration both legally and rhetorically, while Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been more restrained.",
      "Mayes and Nessel, both serving as the chief law enforcement officers of battleground states, have started a podcast together, \u201cPantsuits and Lawsuits.\u201d",
      "In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been at times solicitous of Trump and Republicans as he pleads for disaster aid to recover from wildfires as Attorney General Rob Bonta sues.",
      "To be clear, neither Hobbs nor Mayes could be mistaken for a Trump supporter. But their differing approaches began even before the election, when Mayes routinely appeared with Democrat Kamala Harris and her surrogates when they visited Arizona, while Hobbs kept her distance.",
      "Mayes first sued Trump the day after he took office, when she joined a coalition of Democratic attorneys general suing to block an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "Since then, she\u2019s joined lawsuits challenging a blanket federal funding freeze, National Institutes of Health funding cuts, Elon Musk\u2019s role atop the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive financial records at the U.S. Treasury.",
      "She held a town hall meeting in Phoenix last week with the Democratic attorneys general from Minnesota, New Mexico Oregon, drawing hundreds of people concerned about Musk\u2019s dismantling of the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cI would just like to see more accountability,\u201d said Tatiana Johnson, a 24-year-old community organizer from Phoenix, who went to Mayes\u2019 town hall. She\u2019s skeptical that Mayes\u2019 lawsuits will restrain Trump, but it matters to her to see someone fighting.",
      "\u201cIt may not make a difference in the grand scheme of things of Trump actually listening to those, but it does make a difference to me,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Hobbs, meanwhile, has been largely holding her fire, sometimes frustrating Democratic voters hungry for leaders to take on Trump.",
      "Arizonans want strong leaders \u201cwho will stand up to a bully and who will protect our Constitution and their rights,\u201d Mayes said. Voters repeatedly elected legendary Republican Sen. John McCain by wide margins, not because they always agreed with him but because \u201cthey knew he was fighting for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m betting on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll find out in 2026 whether I\u2019m right or wrong.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. chief launched a new initiative Wednesday to reform the United Nations as it approaches its 80th anniversary, saying the 193-member global organization needs an urgent update to deal with major funding reductions and still tackle the world's challenges.",
      "Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres dismissed any relationship between his UN80 Initiative and cuts to foreign aid and other programs that U.S. President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk say will make the U.S. government more efficient.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about completely different processes, methodologies and objectives,\u201d Guterres told reporters. \u201cThis is a continuation and an intensification of work that we have always been doing.\u201d",
      "He said the U.N. initiative\u2019s objective will be to present member states with proposals for improving the way the organization works, reviewing the increasing number of mandates from the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly, and making structural changes to streamline operations.",
      "Guterres and his predecessors in past decades have struggled to reform the United Nations, which was established following World War II, and bring it into a modern era with different powers, new technology and greater global divisions.",
      "One key problem is that while the secretary-general is the U.N.\u2019s chief executive, power rests with the 193 member nations that have very different ideas about the U.N. and the world.",
      "Stressing that the United Nations reflects the world, Guterres said these are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability.",
      "He said the U.N.\u2019s work is affected by multiplying conflicts, inadequate progress in reducing poverty, widespread flouting of international law, violations of human rights and the lack of guardrails for new technologies, including artificial intelligence \u2014 to name a few.",
      "\u201cAnd all of them are aggravated by major reductions of funding for humanitarian aid and development cooperation,\u201d the secretary-general said. \u201cIn many cases, these obstacles are fueling dangerous levels of geopolitical tensions and divisions.\u201d",
      "Guterres didn\u2019t name any countries, but the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was in charge of humanitarian aid, and cut 83% of USAID's programs. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, also are reducing humanitarian aid.",
      "He said the U.N.\u2019s resources have been shrinking, pointing to its liquidity crisis for at least the past seven years because not all member states pay their yearly dues, and many don\u2019t pay on time.",
      "Guterres said the UN80 Initiative is not only about reforming the U.N. but about \u201cbetter serving people whose very lives depend on us\u201d and \u201ctaxpayers around the world who underwrite everything we do.\u201d",
      "The initiative will cover not only the U.N. Secretariat but all its funds and agencies and offices in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. It will be led by U.N. Undersecretary-General for Policy Guy Ryder, who will head a task force of top officials from the U.N. system, Guterres said.",

      "Again and again the Trump White House has turned to a 73-year-old legal statute to defend its immigration crackdown.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 on Tuesday to explain the arrest and planned deportation of a Palestinian activist and legal U.S. resident with a green card.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited it in late February when announcing that anyone living in the U.S. illegally would have to register with the federal government.",
      "The act has been mentioned in presidential orders, press releases and speeches.",
      "But what is it?",
      "The act comes up so frequently because it is the legal foundation of modern immigration law, encompassing a vast range of regulations and procedures. It has been amended hundreds of times since it was passed, during the Truman administration.",
      "Decades of sweeping changes in immigration law link back to the act.",
      "\u201cThese were all massive public laws in their own standing, but they were all amending\u201d the 1952 legislation, said Niels Frenzen, an immigration expert at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.",
      "The law, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, came amid the anti-communist fears of the early Cold War. While it eased some race-based immigration restrictions, particularly for Asians, it effectively limited most immigration to Europeans. It also codified rules allowing ideology to be used to deny immigration and allow deportation.",
      "Most recently, the Trump White House used the act as the basis to arrest Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests at Columbia University against the Israel-Hamas war. Khalil, a Palestinian who was born and raised in Syria, became a legal permanent resident, also known as a green card holder, last year. He is married to an American citizen.",
      "But the administration says he still can be expelled.",
      "\u201cUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act the secretary of state has the right to revoke a green card or a visa for individuals who are adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests\u201d of the U.S., Leavitt told reporters Tuesday.",
      "The reality is more complicated, legal scholars say. The provision the White House is using \u2013 Section 237 (a)(4)(C) - is rarely invoked, requires extensive judicial review and is intended for unusual cases when someone\u2019s presence in the U.S. could cause diplomatic turmoil.",
      "\u201cThe deportation has to have some seriousness to it,\u201d said Richard Boswell, a University of California San Francisco law professor whose work often focuses on immigration. \u201cThe burden is on the government\u201d to show the person should be deported.",
      "Scholars often point back to the Clinton administration for a recent, high-profile example.",
      "Mario Ruiz Massieu was a former deputy attorney general in Mexico when he was arrested in 1995 for trying to leave the U.S. with $26,000 in undeclared cash. Then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that not deporting Ruiz-Massieu \u201cwould jeopardize our ability to work with Mexico on law enforcement matters.\u201d",
      "-Under Section 212(f) , the president may block entry of \u201cany aliens or class of aliens into the United States\u201d whose presence would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Donald Trump used that broad language to impose a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries during his first term and, on the first day of his second term, laid groundwork for a renewed travel ban. His advisers are expected to make recommendations later this month.",
      "-In late February, Noem said in a statement she would \u201cfully enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act,\u201d and would require anyone living in the U.S. illegally to register with the federal government, with those who don\u2019t facing fines, imprisonment or both.",
      "- Joe Biden used the act's humanitarian parole provision more than any president to allow temporarily allow people into the U.S. from countries including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Specifically, it allows the president to admit anyone \u201con a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\u201d The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit for ending the long-standing legal tool."

      "Gun rights advocates have been fighting to overturn a Florida law setting the minimum age to buy a gun at 21 since the day the measure was signed, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in 2018",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Gun rights advocates have fought to overturn a Florida law banning gun purchases by people under 21 ever since the day the measure was signed in 2018 following the Parkland school shooting, one of the deadliest mass killings in the U.S.",
      "With new leadership in Florida's Republican-controlled capitol, conservative lawmakers appear to have their best chance in years of persuading colleagues to roll back the law. A bill to lower the state\u2019s gun-buying age to 18 would ensure \u201call adult citizens in Florida are afforded their full Second Amendment rights,\u201d state Rep. Michelle Salzman said Wednesday as the measure she's sponsoring cleared its first committee stop in the House.",
      "Here's what to know about the bill:",
      "The law was passed following an extraordinary lobbying effort by survivors and family members of the 17 people killed in the Parkland shooting, which was carried out by a former student who was 19 years old and legally able to buy guns under the state's laws at the time.",
      "In the days after the Feb. 14 massacre, survivors and family members of victims descended on the state capitol to demand action from lawmakers, who were in the middle of their regular session. Some legislative leaders traveled to the crime scene, seeing with their own eyes the carnage in the classrooms.",
      "Weeks after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, then-Gov. Rick Scott signed a package of gun safety measures surrounded by Parkland families, including the provision raising the gun-buying age from 18 to 21.",
      "Within hours, the National Rifle Association filed suit to challenge the law. That dispute is still playing out in federal court.",
      "Florida has long been on the frontier of expanding gun rights. But gun control advocates \u2014 and some key Republicans \u2014 have resisted rolling back the restrictions.",
      "The measure has the backing of Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez and Gov. Ron DeSantis. If 18-year-olds are mature enough to risk their lives serving in the military overseas, the governor says, they should have the right to buy guns.",
      "\u201cThey come home and they can\u2019t even buy a rifle to go hunt,\u201d DeSantis told reporters. \u201cAre you an adult or not?\u201d",
      "The measure has historically faced more resistance in the state Senate. The chamber\u2019s new president, Republican Ben Albritton, has aligned with law enforcement officers in opposing the rollback of other gun restrictions, but has said he\u2019s considering lowering the gun-buying age.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking through that,\u201d Albritton said of the proposal earlier this month. \u201cCertainly the most important thing that I don\u2019t want to do is make a mistake.\u201d",
      "The Parkland shooting left a lasting impact on schools across the state and galvanized a new generation of Florida activists and elected officials.",
      "\u201cHave we forgotten the pain of Parkland?\u201d asked Fiona Shannon, a volunteer with the League of Women Voters Seminole County who testified against the bill Wednesday.",
      "Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman, who at the time of the shooting was a school board member in the county that's home to Parkland, called the bill \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to the families who fought for the law.",
      "\u201cWe owe it to these families not to go backwards,\u201d Bartleman said. \u201cWe can't do this. It's wrong.\u201d",
      "For the past two years, then-Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, a Republican, made clear that lowering the gun-buying age was a \u201cnon-starter\u201d in her chamber. While a bill was passed by the full House during the last two sessions, no companion bills were filed in the Senate.",
      "Legislators in the House and Senate have filed bills lowering the minimum age for buying a gun to 18.",
      "If the measure passes, Floridians aged 18 and older would be able to purchase a long gun, such as a rifle or shotgun, from a federally licensed seller or in a private sale. Under federal law, those under 21 would still be barred from buying a handgun from a licensed dealer.",
      "In January, a U.S. appeals court ruled against the federal law that young adults must be 21 to buy handguns, finding it violated the Second Amendment.",

      "The threat marked a further escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump moved forward with a plan to widen US tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposing a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries.",
      "That followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.",
      "Leaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products.",

      "EU President Ursula von der Leyen said the response was intended to be \"strong but proportionate\" and added that the EU stood \"ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue\".",
      "\"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and worse for consumers,\" she said, warning the economic disruption put jobs at stake and would send prices higher.",

      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "EU hits back at Trump tariffs and warns against trade war",
      "Is the US really heading into a recession?",
      "Trump had said he wants to boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term the taxes on imports of the metals will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth.",
      "Major packaged food makers including Quaker Oats and Folgers coffee asked Trump for targeted exemptions from tariffs on imports such as cocoa and fruit, according to a letter seen by Reuters.",
      "PepsiCo, Conagra and J M Smucker, also requested the president exempt ingredients not available from US sources in the letter, which was sent by the trade group the Consumer Brands Association.",
      "Coffee, oats, cocoa, spices, tropical fruit and tin mill steel, used for some food and household goods, are among the imports listed as unavailable domestically, Reuters reported.",
      "The import taxes are also expected to reduce demand for steel and aluminium that is not made in the US - a blow to makers of the metals elsewhere.",
      "The EU estimated that the latest US tariffs affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports.",
      "Shares in the US were mixed on Wednesday, after two days of sharp decline. The Dow closed down 0.2%, while the S&P 500 ended nearly 0.5% higher and the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%.",
      "In an appearance at the White House with the Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump said he did not plan to back down from his trade fight, saying he was \"not happy\" with EU trade policies.",

      "\"They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,\" he said.",

      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to protect disabled people claiming welfare payments from expected cuts to the benefits system.",

      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",

      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",

      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",
      "Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.",
      "Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",

As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",

      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",

      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",

      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of motorists could be in line for compensation payouts if they were mis-sold finance agreements when buying a car.",
      "Investigations are ongoing into activities by dealers and lenders \u2013 some of which have now been banned \u2013 which could eventually lead to an industry-wide payout scheme to consumers.",
      "A significant Court of Appeal decision may extend compensation to a wider group of people, prompting huge debate among consumers and policymakers. The Supreme Court will soon hear an appeal of that ruling.",
      "What's the scandal about?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In 2021, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).",
      "The FCA said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "Currently, any claims on this issue made to the ombudsman, which has tens of thousands of open cases, or the courts are effectively on hold.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "Potentially, millions of motorists could receive payouts, depending on how their interest rate was set and what they knew about it. Those who had a finance deal, which had a DCA, before 28 January 2021 could receive compensation.",
      "This would likely be done through a central scheme, organised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which wants an orderly compensation system in place.",
      "It would be simpler for consumers than filing a legal complaint and would require firms to check if customers had lost out.",
      "If such a plan was confirmed then further details, such as whether motorists would need to make a complaint first, would need to be ironed out.",
      "The FCA said such a scheme was now more likely to happen than when it first opened the investigation.",
      "How much could they receive?",
      "That is far from clear yet, but lenders \u2013 including some of the UK's biggest banks \u2013 have set aside billions of pounds already.",
      "A driver would likely receive the difference between the amount they paid at an inflated interest rate and the rate they should have been charged.",
      "Interest of 8% on the overpayment would be added to that loss, which could significantly increase the payout.",
      "Exact amounts would depend on individual circumstances.",
      "Is this a wider issue?",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal at the end of last year has blown open the ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Car loan scandal payout fears as row drags on",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Under the FCA's plans, providers will have until December to consider and respond to complaints, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "But the Supreme Court will soon hear an appeal against the decision on the wider commission issue.",
      "The total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn or more, according to analysts.",
      "When will the Supreme Court make a decision?",
      "The hearing is scheduled for three days, starting on 1 April.",
      "A judgement by the court judges will be made some time later.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive.",
      "It could also affect banks' ability to invest elsewhere as they would need the money for compensation."

      "However, creditors have won the right to challenge the High Court's decision to allow \u00a33bn funding and their appeal begins on Tuesday.",
      "Even with the rescue deal, Thames still has huge debts and is struggling to fix leaks, sewage spills and modernise outdated infrastructure.",
      "Thames serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Without this latest financial lifeline, it had faced running out of money by the end of March.",
      "How did Thames end up with so much debt?",
      "Many UK water companies have large debts, but Thames Water's problems are the worst.",
      "Water companies were privatised in 1989, with the idea that private investment would improve the system.",
      "But critics say this hasn't happened - some companies have taken on too much debt and failed to invest in infrastructure.",
      "When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about \u00a319bn.",
      "Its debt pile increased sharply when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames Water, with debts reaching more than \u00a310bn by the time the company was sold in 2017.",
      "Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewage infrastructure while it owned the company, but critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends.",
      "Will the rescue deal avert crisis for Thames?",
      "Thames says the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "However, that group of creditors is now appealing against the High Court's decision.",
      "If the funding deal had not been approved, Thames faced the possibility of a temporary nationalisation, under a measure known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "What will that mean for customers?",
      "Even if Thames Water had come under special administration, customers would have seen no impact on their services. Taps would still have run and toilets still have flushed.",
      "However, water bills in general are set to rise, with the rate at which they are due to increase set by the water regulator Ofwat.",
      "Ofwat, the water regulator, says that Thames Water can increase bills by up to 35% - excluding inflation - over the next five years.",
      "But the company says it needs a 53% rise to fix pipes and keep up with demand. It has appealed for permission to charge more.",
      "Customers are unhappy. Consumer groups argue people shouldn't have to pay more because the company has been badly run.",
      "But Sir Adrian Montague, Thames Water's chairman, has warned that without bigger price rises, the company cannot guarantee safe and resilient water supplies that can cope with climate change and population growth.",
      "Who owns Thames Water now?",
      "Thames Water is privately owned by a group of pension funds and investment firms. The biggest shareholders include:",
      "Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Canada) - 32%",

      "China Investment Corporation - 9%",
      "Other investors include funds from Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands.",
      "Why was Thames Water privatised?",
      "The entire water and waste sector was privatised 34 years ago under the late Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for \u00a37.6bn. At the time, Mrs Thatcher wrote off the industry's \u00a35bn debt, leaving companies with a clean slate and gave them \u00a31.5bn in public money.",
      "The government had wanted to privatise the industry in 1984 but a public backlash against the plan saw it shelved until after the general election three years later. At the time, the UK was under pressure from Europe to improve the purity of its water.",
      "However, meeting European standards would cost billions of pounds worth of investment which, it was hoped, would come from the private sector and, by extension, companies' customers.",
      "\"If we want environmental improvement, it will cost money,\" said Mrs Thatcher in 1988. \"It will be the people who want those improvements in water who will have to pay.\"",
      "Former Labour MP Ann Taylor later said of privatising the water industry: \"The message is always the same - maximise the cost to the consumer to ensure maximum return to the investor. We should not be surprised at that. After all, that is what private investors expect of their companies.\"",

      "Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.",
      "\"I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"",

      "In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.",
      "There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.",
      "\"First of all, people underappreciate privacy,\" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.",
      "\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"",
      "Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.",
      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",

      "\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.",
      "She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.",
      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",
      "Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.",

      "In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.",
      "Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",

Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",

      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",

      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",

      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister."

      "Lightbody's father, who had dementia, died in a nursing home in December 2019.",
      "He said he was \"numb for a year\" following his father's death, but hopes the book will help other people who are grieving.",
      "\"I wasn't writing it thinking people were ever going to read it, I was writing it for myself,\" he told BBC News NI.",
      "The frontman, whose hits include Chasing Cars and Run, was speaking ahead of the release of his book, The Forest is the Path.",

      "\"You can't grieve someone's passing without having loved them in the first place,\" he said.",
      "\"I guess when I got to the end of the book, I was like just in case somebody else has gone through this, and felt like I did, like I was broken, I wanted to put it out there into the world even if it was just on an extended inlay card.\"",
      "Lightbody writes of his memories of the day his father died, his love for his father, and his guilt \"at being absent for so much of what had passed these last years of your cognitive decline and illness\".",
      "The singer said his father's death had taught him \"to get through anything\".",
      "\"I never imagined, you don't imagine that happening, a parent passing,\" he said.",
      "\"So I never thought about it, even when he had dementia, I was refusing to believe it and perhaps that's what caused the numbness in the first place.",
      "\"But you have to get on with things as well.",
      "\"In the book, talking about the immediate things that need to be attended to straight after a death.",
      "\"I felt like a torch had been passed and I was the man of the family now \u2013 I was having to stand up and be that.\"",

      "Getting sober then compelled him to focus on his mental health.",
      "Lightbody said he felt \"less fragile now\" and was determined not to waste any days.",
      "\"A lot of the times I am writing in the book about a version of myself that is now extinct,\" he said.",
      "\"But it is a version that did exist, it was a me that interacted with the world that was drunk or on drugs or in some kind of fugue state and now I feel that I am awake and present and feel much stronger for it.\"",
      "The book is a companion to the Snow Patrol album, also entitled The Forest is the Path, which was released last year.",

    "summary": "Actor and comedian Mo Amer explains why he avoided mentioning the 7 October attack in the show's storyline.",
    "story": [
      "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.",
      "Pride and hurt.",
      "\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.",
      "The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.",
      "Making a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.",
      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",
      "There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.",
      "The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.",
      "That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",
      "This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says.",
      "The show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.",
      "\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.",
      "'I never lose hope'",
      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",
      "There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.",
      "\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.",
      "\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"",
      "The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.",
      "It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.",
      "From his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Mo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.",
      "The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.",
      "Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",
      "Israel occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.",
      "Palestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.",
      "\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.",
      "He adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.",
      "Mo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.",
      "He says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.",
      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",
      "Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.",
      "\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.",
      "\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"",
      "Mo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".",
      "\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.",
      "\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"",
      "The ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.",
      "Mo says he is \"always hopeful\" things can get better.",
      "\"I never lose hope.",

      "The Scottish actor performed in more than 100 films but was best known for being the \"third man\" to Laurel and Hardy.",

      "Now Finlayson has been memorialised with a new portrait in the Scottish theatre where he first trod the boards more than a century ago.",
      "Dobbie Hall in his hometown of Larbert, Stirling, commissioned the oil painting to celebrate the actor's career and rise to international fame in the early days of cinema.",
      "The portrait by young artist Connor Draycott was unveiled by Finlayson's family.",
      "They were joined by fans of the black and white movies and \"talkies\" from the UK chapters of Sons of the Desert, named after the fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film of the same name.",
      "More stories from Tayside and Central",
      "Listen to news from Tayside and Central on BBC Sounds",
      "Finlayson, known as Fin to his fans and as Jimmy to his good friend Stan Laurel, was born in Larbert in 1887.",
      "He worked for a while as a tinsmith in his father's foundry before moving to Edinburgh to study and then pursue an acting career.",
      "At the age of 23 he was performing at the Theatre Royal, but his ambitions were not satisfied.",
      "After the death of his parents he moved to New York with his brother.",
      "Within the year he had landed a role on Broadway in The Great Game, for which reviews offered \"nothing but praise\".",
      "In May 1912, the New York Dramatic Mirror said Finlayson had \"an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role - the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective\".",
      "It added: \"The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"",
      "He took on another Scottish character in the Broadway production of Bunty Pulls the Strings, but pulled out of the national tour in 1916 when Hollywood beckoned.",
      "By 1919 he was signed with the \"King of Comedy\" Mack Sennet, appearing as a Keystone Cop and lauded as a \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\".",
      "After a move to Hal Roach at Culver City in 1923, Finlayson was tested in different billings, sometimes in a lead role or as one of a comic trio with up-and-coming comics Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.",
      "He eventually found his niche as their established comic support or antagonist.",
      "By the time he died aged 66 in 1953, he had more than 100 film credits to his name and his eccentric mannerisms were internationally recognised.",
      "The double-take, the squint then a one-eyed stare and raised eyebrow - Finlayson's madcap facial expressions became his trademark, along with the drawn-out \"dohhhh\".",
      "It inspired Dan Castellaneta when he voiced Homer in The Simpsons, which first aired in 1989.",
      "It is also said Finlayson's fake walrus moustache allowed him a degree of anonymity even in his heyday in Hollywood.",
      "The artist who created his new portrait said he toyed with the idea of picturing the actor without his famous facial hair.",
      "Draycott, who is studying fine art at Glasgow School of Art, was commissioned to produce the artwork by the Dobbie Hall Trust.",
      "It wanted to commemorate the Larbert man's global success and inspire young performers who appear in shows at the theatre.",
      "Draycott, 20, said it was an honour to be asked to create the portrait for the theatre.",
      "And he revealed he spent hours watching Finlayson's films to \"recreate his trademark facial expression\".",
      "Draycott said: \"James is such a well-known face among fans of black and white movies and I wanted to capture the distinctive look that made him a real superstar of his day.\"",
      "The award-winning artist said he was fascinated by Finlayson's look and story.",
      "He added: \"There was initially some debate as to whether I should include his moustache in the portrait, as it was actually a false moustache that he wore specially for filming, but we decided that his moustache was such an integral part of his unique look that it should feature in the painting.\"",
      "\"I like the fact that despite his face being so well-known during the 19040s and 50's he could apparently remove the moustache and walk around Hollywood without being recognised by members of the public.\"",
      "But now, thanks to his portrait, new generations in his hometown will recognise the young man from Larbert who followed his dream all the way to Hollywood."

      "Ten years ago, Sir Terry Pratchett died aged 66, eight years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His friend and lifelong agent Colin Smythe recalls his memories of the renowned fantasy author.",
      "A 20-year-old Terry Pratchett first walked into the office of the man who would become his first publisher and his agent in 1968.",
      "Colin Smythe had just published a book about education and Sir Terry had been sent by the Bucks Free Press to write up a story about it.",
      "Sir Terry mentioned that he would rather be an author than a journalist and the link-up began.",
      "Mr Smythe went on to publish the Beaconsfield-born writer's first five books, before becoming his agent. He retained that role until Sir Terry's death on 12 March 2015.",
      "When asked why Sir Terry enjoyed working with him, he recalled: \"Terry would tell me: 'You are the person I distrust the least in the publishing business'.\"",
      "\"The trouble is I was spoilt. I was exceptionally lucky that I was the individual he distrusted least,\" said Mr Smythe, now 83.",
      "Sir Terry first showed Mr Smythe his fiction work in the summer of 1968 and the publisher was immediately struck by his \"brilliance, sense of humour and his skill at writing\".",
      "\"At that time publishers were much more prepared to back their hunches,\" he said.",
      "\"This is a person who I did not want to allow to go some place else.\"",
      "The first book the pair worked on together was The Carpet People, which released in 1971.",
      "In 1986, after publishing the second Discworld story, The Light Fantastic, the friends agreed Sir Terry would need a bigger publisher and Mr Smythe would instead act as his agent.",
      "The Buckinghamshire-based publisher used his contacts to secure Sir Terry a deal at Victor Gollancz Ltd, which was known for science fiction and fantasy titles.",
      "As Sir Terry was already known to publishers, Mr Smythe said his job was often focused on negotiating contracts or arranging speaking events.",
      "That left Sir Terry to focus on his passion of writing.",
      "\"He didn't write as often as I would like. He would tend to write during winter evenings. In the summer evenings he preferred gardening,\" he said.",
      "\"He could write fast. He always worked on the idea that he would do at least 400 words a day. As it evolved he might do more, maybe 400 words before breakfast.\"",
      "Mr Smythe admitted he was occasionally chastised for making deals worth \"too much money\".",
      "He said: \"On one occasion... two publishers competed. Each came up with one price and I rang up Terry and said: 'They have offered me \u00a3750,000'.",
      "\"He said: 'This is mad, there is far too much testosterone going on around here'.",
      "\"He used to say: 'Truth be told, I shall tell them I would pay to be allowed to write.'",
      "\"I thought it was best not to tell that to the publishers.\"",
      "Sir Terry died after being diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"It affected his motor abilities rather than his cognitive abilities,\" said Mr Smythe.",
      "\"While he thought he was going to die within a few years, he went on with enough time to write another six best-sellers.\"",
      "Mr Smythe said 10 years after the death of his friend, he still misses \"the pleasure of his company\".",
      "He said: \"He was humorous, interesting, wide-ranging - all sorts of things.",
      "\"On one or two occasions I'd get a phone call on a Saturday: 'I'm stuck, I'm not sure where I go from here'.",
      "\"He'd tell me a layout of how far he'd got and you'd talk to him and he'd say: 'Oh, now I know where I'm going'. And he'd hang up.\"",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "summary": "As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame.",
    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.",
      "Current Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice says under-fives should avoid the drinks and under-11s should have no more than one.",

    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "A study by Glasgow University in 2019 found former professional footballers were almost three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population.",
      "Windass said he wanted to raise awareness of dementia and get players' union the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to increase its support to affected players and their families.",
      "\"The one thing I love about myself is trying to help as many people as I can in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",

      "To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job.",

      "They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.",

      "Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.",

      "And Labour strategists believe that appearing to get a handle on welfare is an essential weapon in the anti-Reform UK armoury.",
      "The strongest argument the government can muster in favour of reform is that too many people who are regarded as long-term sick are in effect thrown on the unemployment scrapheap when, with the right help, they could engage in the world of work.",
      "And it's understood that the Treasury won't swallow up all of the welfare savings.",
      "Kendall will be able to redirect a significant sum \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn \u2013 into the kind of intensive support which some claimants would need to get off benefits.",
      "This, of course, would be expected to lead to savings in due course but won't bring instant rewards.",
      "Starmer urged to protect disability benefit claimants",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Another argument being made is that the system currently provides a perverse incentive which encourages sickness over work.",
      "If you were to be assessed as having a limited capacity to work or undertake work-related activity you could be paid around \u00a3400 more a month than someone who is unemployed actively looking for work.",
      "That gap is likely to be narrowed.",
      "Where the government has a bigger challenge is to convince its own MPs that the level of Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - which are not means tested and are made to people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition - ought to change, and future eligibility restricted.",

      "PIP cuts don't fit in to the narrative of providing opportunities to people who are languishing on the dole.",

      "The Department for Work and Pensions has consulted with charities, but even before the Green Paper has seen the light of day some of those organisations have been firing off denunciatory press releases.",
      "The state of the public finances means the Treasury needs to rein in spending if the chancellor is to meet her own fiscal rules, including having debt fall as a share of national income on a five-year horizon.",
      "The expectation is that PIP payments will be frozen next year \u2013 so their value will erode - and that some of those in receipt of PIP are likely to face re-assessment and may lose their payments entirely.",
      "Loyalty tested to the limit?",
      "It's here in particular that some the usually loyal MPs - not associated with the party's Left -  are expressing concerns.",
      "We have spoken to some of them who listened to the PM make the case for welfare reform at a private meeting on Monday, or who attended the private meetings on Wednesday.",
      "An attendee said there was too little detail to reach a definitive view but cutting disabled benefits was likely to be a red line. Others were more outspoken.",
      "One told us: \"People won't wear it. The costs of being disabled aren't going down.",
      "\"They cant just force this through like the winter fuel cut.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we're freezing PIP that is unforgivable.",

      "\"But punishing those who are especially vulnerable and have severe disabilities is unacceptable.\"",
      "Another added: \"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not.\"",
      "We were told some \"heartfelt conversations\" were had with the No 10 team on Wednesday and there is a hope that the potential PIP freeze can be thawed.",
      "\"This is still a live conversation,\" one MP said.",
      "Some MPs also felt that the timing of the welfare cuts was wrong.",

      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",

      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",

      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",

      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",

      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",

      "Nearly a third of those who received Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in childhood had claims for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) rejected when trying to move to the adult benefit, BBC analysis has found.",
      "Disability charity Scope said a \"complex, adversarial and difficult to navigate\" system contributed to the rejections.",
      "With widespread benefits reform proposals expected within weeks, Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week called the current system \"unsustainable, indefensible and unfair\".",
      "The conditions most likely to result in a refused claim were those that may be managed more successfully by an adult than a child, like diabetes or asthma, experts said.",
      "But among those to have had claims rejected since PIP's introduction in 2013 are thousands living with life-changing conditions including cancer, blindness, psychosis, deafness and epilepsy.",
      "The 124,000 young people affected since then include Holly Crouch, who said the decision by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had left her feeling \"like a burden\" when \"nothing changed but my age\".",
      "She said she had been refused PIP when she applied as a teenager, despite providing evidence from specialists saying she was at risk of sudden, life-threatening epileptic seizures.",
      "'I'm not faking this'",
      "Miss Crouch said the DWP had decided she no longer needed support because she had been seizure-free for several weeks.",
      "Holly's parents subsequently lost their Carers' Allowance payments but still have to provide constant supervision.",
      "The 21-year-old from East Sussex said: \"My condition has not magically disappeared and I'm not faking this.",
      "\"Everything was taken so quickly and I felt angry, neglected and like I hadn't been believed. It was so hard to deal with.\"",
      "Holly said she had lost three jobs because of her epilepsy and had to \"rely on others for everything\" without PIP.",
      "\"I'll never feel like an adult as I can't do things everyone else is able to, like drive or work,\" she said. \"My parents even have to be there when I shower or boil a kettle as I could have a seizure.",
      "\"I understand there could be changes to conditions, but that's what reviews are for - you shouldn't just have your money stopped at 16 when you are not old enough for the process.\"",
      "James Taylor, Scope's executive director of strategy, said the number of young people losing out on financial support was \"worrying\".",
      "He called on the government to work with disabled people and \"fix our broken welfare system\".",

      "Three-quarters of those deemed ineligible for PIP had failed the DWP's points-based assessment, according to BBC analysis.",

      "They include:",

      "A teenager with learning difficulties who said he could cook for himself but did not mention he had broken several microwaves in trying to do so",
      "Concerns were repeatedly raised about PIP assessors lacking knowledge of specific conditions and decisions being taken without recourse to medical evidence or contacting those involved in a claimant's care.",

      "\u2022 Personal Independence Payment is a benefit for over-16s with long-term physical or mental health conditions",
      "\u2022 It is not means-tested and aims to fund the extra living costs associated with having a disability",
      "\u2022 Assessments focus on how capable someone is of living independently and use a series of questions about daily activities",
      "\u2022 Points are awarded based on the individual's abilities and what help they need",
      "\u2022 Those points are added up to determine whether the threshold for a claim is met",
      "\u2022 A third party - like a parent or carer - can apply to represent someone without the capacity to do so themselves",
      "A recent Resolution Foundation report found the number of young people in receipt of disability benefits falls significantly between the ages of 15 and 17.",
      "The think-tank said the failure to qualify - or apply for - PIP was leaving many  \"facing a financial cliff-edge\" as they approached adulthood.",
      "Fightback4Justice, which advocates for disabled people in the welfare system, has called for the process to be more transitional.",
      "Its founder, Michelle Cardno, said: \"Young people are being treated as adults from the day they reach 16, when most do not understand the system.\"",
      "Sally Donley acted for her son Euan Hawes when he was invited to transition from DLA to PIP.",
      "She says she spent two hours talking with an assessor about the impact of Euan's disabilities, which include autism, obsessive compulsive disorder and sensory processing disorder.",
      "\"His assessment was with a nurse who had no background in his issues and he ended up only scoring points for not mixing with others,\" said Ms Donley, from Hampshire.",
      "\"Because I said he could cook eggs in the microwave, they said he could cook for himself and they said he goes to college independently - but it's a specialist college he travels an hour in a taxi to.\"",
      "Euan's claim was refused, but the decision was eventually overturned and he was granted PIP's highest rates when Ms Donley took the DWP to a tribunal.",
      "\"The stress this puts on families is horrendous and cruel,\" she said. \"You have parents trying to care for children with disabilities and they're having to take hours to gather evidence for court appeals.",

    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told his ministers they should take more responsibility for decisions rather than \"outsourcing\" them to regulators.",
      "Sir Keir suggested to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday he wanted ministers to take a more active role in delivering the government's priorities.",
      "He said the Labour government \"must go further and faster to reform the state\", including reviewing regulations with no role its plans.",
      "The prime minister spoke to his top team ahead of a speech on Thursday, when he is expected to announce an overhaul of how the government works.",
      "In the meeting, Sir Keir did not give examples of decisions made by regulators instead of ministers.",
      "But he appeared to be referring to non-departmental public bodies, which are organisations funded by taxpayers but not controlled directly by central government.",

      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",

      "\"The state has become larger, but it hasn't become more effective,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson said regulators had \"not been focused enough on growth\" and that would be a theme of the prime minister's speech on Thursday.",
      "Hours after the cabinet meeting, the government announced it was scraping the Payment Systems Regulator, which oversees financial transactions such as those through cash machines or contactless payments.",

      "\"It will also delay the huge benefit households need to see from ending their reliance on fossil fuels and their volatile prices.\"",
      "WWF Scotland also criticised the move and questioned the logic behind it.",
      "Io Hadjicosta, the charity's climate and energy policy manager, said: \"This announcement is deeply concerning and is yet another case of the Scottish government flip flopping when it comes to tackling the climate emergency.",
      "\"Reducing emissions from Scotland's housing stock by improving insulation and fitting renewable heat pumps would lift people out of fuel poverty - not increase it.",
      "\"By delaying the introduction of the Heat in Buildings Bill further all the government is doing is condemning the poorest in our society to increasingly high fossil fuel costs and damp, unhealthy homes.\"",
      "Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesperson on net zero and energy, said the plans were \"completely unrealistic\".",
      "He said: \"We repeatedly warned nationalist ministers that they would hammer hard-pressed Scots with huge costs but until now they have ploughed ahead regardless.",
      "\"Gillian Martin must now go back to the drawing board and work up proposals that are fair to taxpayers and guarantee their concerns will be listened to.\"",
      "Last April the Scottish government confirmed it would scrap its annual and interim targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "It said they would be replaced with a system measuring emissions every five years.",
      "In a statement to the Scottish parliament, Energy Secretary Mairi McAllan accepted that the target of cutting emissions by 75% by 2030 was out of reach.",
      "But she told MSPs the government must act to chart a course reach net zero by 2045 at a pace and scale which was feasible, fair and just.",
      "The Heat in Buildings Bill was once described to me as \"game changing\" legislation designed to reduce the massive carbon footprint that comes from heating our homes.",
      "Our gas boilers are the main culprit; lots of individual devices inefficiently burning fossil fuels to create the heat.",
      "At least a million of them needed to be replaced by 2030 to meet the Scottish government's now abandoned interim climate change targets.",
      "The legislation would have meant anyone buying a home would have had to change to a green heating system \u2013 like a heat pump \u2013 within, say, two years of the sale being completed. The exact time frame had not been decided.",
      "But with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.",
      "Although the plan could be revived in the future it is pretty clear, from the tone of the ministerial statement, that something major would have to change for that to happen."

    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",

      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",

      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",

      "Callers to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will be able to use their voice as a password in a bid to speed up calls, a government minister has announced.",
      "The UK tax authority has been heavily criticised for its failure to answer tens of thousands of calls, and for long delays on phonelines.",
      "James Murray, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said HMRC was trialling a system used by banks to use voice recognition to improve call handling.",
      "This would allow callers to pass security checks \"faster and more securely\", he said.",
      "The system is expected to be introduced across HMRC phonelines during the rest of the year.",
      "Customers' voice recordings are converted into encrypted biometric data, then used to clear security checks.",
      "Frustrated callers",

      "Mr Murray announced the plans in a speech to tax professionals on Tuesday.",
      "\"We are going further and faster to overhaul the way HMRC works,\" he said.",
      "That included simplifying systems, such as the declaration of income from so-called side-hustles for tax purposes.",
      "It also meant learning from the private sector to make customer service more efficient.",
      "A report by the Public Accounts Committee of MPs in January included figures that showed the failings of HMRC's phone line.",
      "It went dead on 43,690 customers who had been waiting 70 minutes to reach an adviser in the first 11 months of the 2023-24 financial year.",
      "This was because HMRC's system could not cope with the volume of calls, but customers were not warned they were about to be cut off, nor were they called back, the report added.",
      "The committee claimed HMRC was running a \"deliberately poor\" phone service in an attempt to push taxpayers to seek help online instead.",
      "However, that claim was described as \"completely baseless\" by HMRC bosses who said they had made huge improvements to service standards.",
      "In March last year, HMRC announced its phone line would be closed between April and September, but was forced to reverse its decision within 24 hours."

    "summary": "New guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories and other backgrounds is set to start in April.",
    "story": [
      "The body advising judges on criminal sentences has hit back at the justice secretary's call for it to scrap new guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories.",
      "The Sentencing Council said ministers from both major parties or their representatives had known about the plans since 2022 and did not object.",
      "It comes after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood last week wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance directing judges to review the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on a punishment.",
      "Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a \"two-tier justice\" system.",
      "Lord Justice William Davis, the chairman of the council, said that Mahmood's officials were fully briefed on the plans that had been three years in the making.",
      "He said that ministers could not \"dictate\" sentencing and he would have to take legal advice on Mahmood's powers over the council's work.",
      "This raises the bizarre possibility that the body advising judges on how to judge might decide to go to court for a ruling on whether the minister overseeing justice has any power to tell judges what to do.",
      "The row was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges and magistrates on the complexities of prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance for England and Wales on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.",
      "These reports do not tie the hands of judges but they often provide the court with a detailed insight into why an individual fell into crime, their risk of reoffending and the chances for rehabilitation outside of jail.",
      "The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.",
      "It also urged them to always consider a report in a wider range of circumstances, including where an offender has an addiction, is transgender, or has learning difficulties.",
      "Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row",
      "Call for ministers to overrule 'two-tier' sentencing changes",
      "More funding for judges to tackle record court delays",
      "Writing to the Sentencing Council last week, Mahmood said she objected to the new guideline, saying: \"As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.\"",
      "That came after the shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the plan as \"two-tier\" justice that would disadvantage white offenders.",
      "But in a six-page letter to Mahmood, the Sentencing Council chair said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities and had been drawn up after long discussions over how particular types of offenders were being treated differently to others.",
      "Lord Justice Davis said that people from ethnic minorities were receiving longer sentences and the aim was to ensure that punishments were more consistent, regardless of background.",
      "He said Conservative and Labour ministers, as well as their their officials, had at least 15 opportunities over three years to object to the plan",
      "\"I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders,\" he said. \"Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.\"",
      "The senior judge said ministerial representative had been at all 15 meetings where the changes was discussed between July 2022 and January 2025.",
      "The public consultation on the plans had set out the proposals and Conservative ministers, then in power, had welcomed the \"fuller guidance\".",
      "\"No concern was expressed about the term now under debate,\" said Lord Justice Davis.",
      "Only eight of 150 responses to the public consultation had objected to the explicit reference to ethnic minorities.",
      "The judge said: \"At no stage did the Lord Chancellor's representative express any concern or reservation about the term now under debate.",
      "\"The walk-through of the guideline with officials from the Ministry of Justice took place on Monday 3 March. Again no concern was expressed about the relevant term.\"",
      "While ministers have an exceptional power to intervene in the Sentencing Council's decisions, this has never been used in a situation where new guidance had been published and the government had already been extensively consulted and had not objected.",
      "\"I shall have to take legal advice as to whether the power... applies in those circumstances,\" said the judge.",
      "He continued: \"I do not accept the premise of your objection to the relevant part of the list of cohorts for whom a pre-sentence report will normally be considered necessary.",
      "\"In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender.",
      "\"If sentencing guidelines of whatever kind were to be dictated in any way by Ministers of the Crown, this principle would be breached.\""

      "The Great Yarmouth MP was suspended by Reform and referred to the police over accusations he made threats of violence against the party's chairman. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed they are assessing an allegation of \"verbal threats\".",
      "There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party.",

      "Last week, Lowe said he had spoken to the senior lawyer looking at the claims and said she had told him she was \"shocked\" at the process, and that no evidence had been given.",
      "On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",
      "\"I find myself in the unfortunate and regrettable position of having to make this statement to correct the record.\"",
      "The lawyer added: \"I have not expressed either 'dismay' or 'shock' at any time as to the process. Nor have I said 'there is zero credible evidence against [Mr Lowe]', let alone said this 'repeatedly'.\"",
      "'No credible evidence against me'",
      "On Friday, Lowe took issue with a statement issued by Reform, which set out that there would be an independent investigation into what had happened.",
      "He wrote: \"I have just spoken to the KC. She is dismayed that this statement has been made, and reiterated that no evidence against me has been sent to her.",
      "\"She stated that this has been issued before the investigation has even started.",
      "\"She is shocked at the process, shocked at the communication from the party, and shocked that no credible evidence has been given, despite her repeated requests.\"",
      "The BBC put the lawyer's statement to Lowe, who then issued his own statement in reply.",
      "\"Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,\" he said.",
      "\"The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me.\"",
      "He added: \"I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in.\"",
      "'You have to stand up to bullies'",
      "He accused the party of an \"outright lie\" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening.",
      "\"I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,\" Lowe told the BBC.",
      "\"I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that.\"",
      "He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: \"I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity.\"",
      "Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\".",
      "Reform has removed the whip from Lowe, meaning he now sits as an independent MP.",
      "Reform spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe said the row was \"temporarily damaging\" to the party - but \"not damaging in the long term\".",
      "Widdecombe told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"The fact is all parties have these eruptions from time to time.",
      "\"But while the investigations are under way I think we should simply wait until they report, and then we will know where we are.\"",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "That Nicola Sturgeon should choose to stand down from Holyrood at the next election was entirely expected.",
      "Even if the former first minister liked to try and keep the media guessing.",
      "When asked a couple of weeks ago if she was going to quit as an MSP she told journalists \"you'll have to wait and see\".",
      "In reality, the chances of her staying on to sit on the backbenches and make worthy interventions were always slim.",
      "Having personally fronted the Scottish government's response to a global pandemic, for instance, she would have been bored to tears.",
      "In her early 50s, she still has time and the potential to develop a post-politics career.",
      "There are memoirs due to be published this summer and a string of book-related events peppering her diary.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon to step down from Holyrood",
      "Nicola Sturgeon says time is right to resign as FM",
      "When she first left power, there was lots of speculation about some kind of international job offer - until the police came calling.",
      "The cloud that hangs over everything is the ongoing investigation into the SNP's finances.",
      "Prosecutors have still to decide whether or not to take any further action with regards to her and the party's former treasurer Colin Beattie - both having been arrested, questioned and released without charge.",
      "The Crown has also to decide whether or not to pursue the embezzlement charges brought against Nicola Sturgeon's ex-husband, the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell.",
      "Operation Branchform",
      "The Operation Branchform investigation, launched in summer 2021, is now so long-running it is by no means certain it will have concluded by the time of the 2026 election.",
      "Whatever decisions are taken, it seems the Sturgeon/Murrell political power couple will face the future independently of one another.",
      "Sturgeon recently announced on behalf of them both that their marriage had ended and that, to all intents and purposes, they had been separated for some time.",
      "While her decision to stand down as an MSP was obvious and much anticipated, it still has the capacity to startle.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon remains the biggest name in Scottish politics.",
      "She was a player in UK politics in a way that neither of her successors could expect to be.",
      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",
      "Then there was her attempt to realign Scottish politics by forming a power-sharing partnership with the Greens to achieve political stability for the Scottish government.",
      "That controversial arrangement was discontinued by her immediate successor Humza Yousaf.",
      "What will be her legacy?",
      "She was the first minister who expanded early learning and childcare and used new welfare powers to introduce a weekly child payment unique to Scotland - policies she would regard as significant achievements.",
      "While opposition parties say they would maintain these benefits, financial watchdogs warn that the extent of health and social welfare spending in Scotland is unsustainable.",
      "All of this is part of the Sturgeon legacy to be debated as she counts down to her departure from the Scottish Parliament in just over a year.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon famously made decisions in a very tight circle and according to one adviser her decision-making group became ever smaller.",
      "By the end, this source said she was operating in \"a circle of one\".",
      "It was ultimately her decision to leave high office just as it is now hers to leave frontline politics altogether.",
      "As she has noted herself in the past, Nicola Sturgeon is a public figure loved and loathed in almost equal measure but there can be few who would doubt that politics will be a duller place without her presence."

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give more detail about the government's plans for the economy.",
    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares",
      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:26:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",
      "She told BBC News she is now \"angry, frustrated and apprehensive about the future\".",
      "\"You spend time making plans based on the best information you have but then that plan I made is now pointless. It's a waste of time and that must be multiplied all around the country, whether it's farmers or nature charities who are managing land and using similar schemes.",

      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",

      "Earth will cast its shadow over the Moon. Unlike in other parts of the world, the eclipse in the UK will only be partial but still a dramatic spectacle, weather permitting.",
      "As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\".",

      "The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.",
      "Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.",
      "At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.",
      "For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.",
      "\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and a blood moon?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.",

      "Penumbral lunar eclipse \u2013 A subtle event where the Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a slight dimming.",
      "People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.",
      "This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.",
      "How to see it?",
      "To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.",
      "\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.",
      "Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.",
      "Also, of course, check the weather forecast.",
      "\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.",

    "summary": "Experts are assessing the potential fallout for marine species and nearby wildlife populations.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental organisations and the UK authorities are assessing how damaging the collision of an oil tanker and a cargo ship in the North Sea will be for marine species and nearby wildlife populations.",
      "It's still too early to tell whether it will have a major impact, and weather conditions in coming days will be a major factor.",
      "But a lot will depend on exactly which toxic chemicals have been spilled and how much of them.",
      "Cargo ship still on fire after collision as owners say no sodium cyanide on board",
      "North Sea tanker collision - what we know so far",
      "What might be on board?",
      "Maritime operations company, Crowley, which was managing the oil tanker the MV Stena Immaculate, has confirmed that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 containers at the time of the incident.",
      "It was not clear on the status of all the containers but Crowley said one had \"ruptured\" and was leaking fuel into the sea.",
      "The contents of the cargo ship, the Solong, which crashed into the tanker have been less clear.",
      "Lloyds List, a shipping data company, said on Monday that it was carrying sodium cyanide.",
      "But on Tuesday Ernst Russ, owners of the cargo ship said: \"We are able to confirm that there are no containers on board ladened with sodium cyanide.",
      "\"There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored.\"",
      "It remains unclear if the ship was carrying other contents at the time of the crash.",
      "What are the dangers of jet fuel and sodium cyanide?",
      "Jet fuel is a toxic substance that can be lethal to marine organisms and other animals like seabirds if ingested.",
      "The level of toxicity is dependent on the crude oil that it has been refined from.",
      "Sodium cyanide, which is used in industry including for metal cleaning, is a also a toxic substance and poisonous for living organisms as it disrupts cell function and leads to oxygen starvation.",
      "Sodium cyanide is also highly soluble in water and it can react vigorously to produce the gas hydrogen cyanide - which is also toxic.",
      "The confirmation that it was only empty containers on board will allay some concerns about environmental damage and make the clean-up operation easier.",
      "The third consideration for authorities will be whether the fuel used to run both ships - the bunker fuel - has also leaked out.",
      "Marine fuel is a lot heavier than jet fuel and can remain in the environment for longer.",
      "Alex Lukyanov at the University of Reading, UK, said. \"Marine diesel can smother habitats and wildlife, affecting their ability to regulate body temperature, potentially resulting in death.\"",
      "\"The environmental toll could be severe,\" he said.",
      "Graham Stuart, the local MP for Beverley and Holderness, said on Tuesday that it appears \"there is no evidence so far of any of the heavy engine oil leaking from either ship\". But he added that this is still possible.",
      "What mitigation can be taken?",
      "The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is overseeing the operation to respond to the incident and clean up any pollution.",
      "Melanie Onn, the MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is currently doing an evaluation of the contamination risk and working with the owners of both of the vessels to plan a salvage operation.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "What we've learned about cleaning up major oil spills",
      "What wildlife may be affected?",
      "The collision happened within an environmentally rich area - both for marine species but also onshore populations of birds who feed on fish and other aquatic organisms.",
      "The Humber Estuary is a site of special scientific interest and along with Bempton Cliffs Nature Reserve supports more than half a million birds annually including pink footed geese, puffins, avocets and bar-tailed godwits.",
      "Within the wider marine environment at this time of year there are breeding seals and harbour porpoises.",
      "Martin Slater, Director of Operations at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust said the time of the year that this spill has occurred is particularly worrying.",
      "\"Many birds are gathering offshore on the sea ahead of the nesting season and we still have wintering waders \u2013 plus migrant birds stopping here \u2013 so we're very worried indeed about the threat to these birds,\" he said.",
      "There is also concern for wildlife further south of the incident to which the jet fuel may spread depending on the wind and sea conditions.",
      "The area off Lincolnshire's coast is \"a unique habitat for fish where seabirds and cetaceans feed\" explained Mr Slater.",

      "Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected.",
      "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods.",
      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",
      "\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"",

    "story": [
      "A private spacecraft that landed lopsided on the Moon does not have enough power to complete its mission, says the company Intuitive Machines.",
      "Athena touched down on the lunar South Pole shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST) on Thursday, but it later was revealed the craft had landed on its side.",
      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",
      "\"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,\" the company said in a statement about the mission called IM-2.",
      "Last year Intuitive Machines' first spacecraft also landed on its side, breaking a leg.",
      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",
      "\"Clearly the mission can only have achieved a fraction of its science goals,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, lunar scientist at the Open University.",
      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",
      "Radio communications from Earth are also more difficult.",
      "And Dr Barber says some of the instruments are likely to have been turned on briefly on Thursday, including the drill and a mass spectrometer that could identify chemicals in gases released from the lunar soil.",
      "That is likely to generate some useful scientific information, he says.",
      "The shortcomings of IM-2 are in contrast to the successful landing of a different private craft on Sunday by the company Firefly Aerospace in a different area of the Moon.",
      "Nasa wants to send four astronauts to the Moon in 2027 in its Artemis programme. Its long-term goal is to take humans to Mars, using the Moon as a stepping stone.",
      "It is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.",
      "\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\"."

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using older, highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "Trials of the system in 2022 retrieved more than 3,000 tonnes of nodules, The Metals Company says.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",
      "\"When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,\" she says.",

      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",

      "\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.",
      "She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.",
      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5ng663d1wo",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:09:20 GMT",
    "summary": "As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.",
    "story": [
      "The fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.",
      "Jay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.",
      "Their lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.",
      "The BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.",
      "The men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.",
      "The men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.",
      "The light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.",
      "\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.",
      "Defeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.",
      "\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.",
      "There is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).",
      "Mexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.",
      "Fentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.",
      "In an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.",
      "Mexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.",
      "And at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.",
      "President Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.",
      "Jay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.",
      "\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.",
      "He coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.",
      "The cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.",
      "\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)",
      "President Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.",
      "On the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.",
      "\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"",
      "Mr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"",
      "In Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.",
      "For the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.",
      "She begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.",
      "Ms Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".",
      "Some she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.",
      "\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.",
      "At first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.",
      "Those two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.",
      "On another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.",
      "In Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.",
      "He, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.",
      "John White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.",
      "\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"",
      "Mr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",
      "Ms Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico that it will improve people's lives in Kensington.",
      "\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.",
      "When the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.",
      "Directly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.",
      "Roz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.",

      "Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on Tuesday and within hours was on a chartered jet which flew via Dubai to The Hague, where the ICC sits.",
      "The 79-year-old could become the first Asian former head of state to go on trial at the ICC.",
      "Duterte, who contested his extradition, led the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and presided over a violent \"war on drugs\" that saw thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others killed without trial.",
      "The Gulfstream G550 landed in Dubai for a stopover early on Wednesday and its expected departure was delayed for several hours while Duterte received medical checks, Reuters news agency reports.",
      "Once the plane had landed in Rotterdam, the ICC confirmed that Duterte was in its custody to face charges \"of murder as a crime against humanity\".",
      "\"A hearing will be scheduled in due course for Mr Duterte's initial appearance before the Court.\"",
      "Meanwhile the former leaders' supporters gathered outside The Hague Penitentiary Institution protesting his arrest. Many of them waved the Philippine flag, while others mimicked Duterte's signature fist-pumping gesture.",
      "\"We stand with Duterte,\" read a banner held up by supporters.",

      "Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance.",
      "Vice-President Duterte said her father's arrest amounted to \"kidnapping\", claiming it violated Philippine sovereignty. She left Manila for the Netherlands on Wednesday, according to her office.",
      "A 'death squad' of bounty hunters",
      "Rodrigo Duterte previously insisted that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the Philippines, since he pulled the country out of the tribunal in 2019, three years after it took note of the drug war's rising death toll.",
      "But according to the Rome Statute that is the basis for the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed before a nation leaves the tribunal.",
      "The ICC investigation covers 2011-2019, which includes the period when Duterte was mayor of Davao, a sprawling metropolis in the country's south, where his family has held power for decades.",
      "Complaints filed against Duterte at the ICC allege that he kept a \"death squad\" of bounty hunters to go after drug suspects in Davao, and later replicated this model on a national scale when he was elected president.",
      "Human Rights Watch called Duterte's arrest a \"critical step for accountability in the Philippines\".",

      "It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others. An American-Israeli soldier, 21-year-old Edan Alexander, is among those said to be alive. There are also the bodies of four other American citizens.",

      "The attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage. Most women and children held captive were released during a week-long truce in November 2023.",
      "The unprecedented, deadly assault triggered a war in Gaza that has since killed more than 48,500 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others."

      "Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected the idea of negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme, as Tehran confirmed receiving a letter from President Donald Trump.",
      "Last week, Trump said the letter proposed talks on a deal that would prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and avert possible military action.",
      "Although Khamenei said he had not seen the letter, which was delivered by an official from the United Arab Emirates, he dismissed it as a \"deception of public opinion\".",
      "\"When we know they won't honour it, what's the point of negotiating?\" he asked, referring to Trump's decision to abandon the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal during his first term.",
      "He warned that Iran would retaliate in the event of strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
      "\"Iran is not seeking war, but if the Americans or their agents take a wrong step, our response will be decisive and certain, and the one who will suffer the most harm is America,\" he said.",

      "Israel hit part of Iran's nuclear programme, Netanyahu says",
      "Ten years ago, the country agreed a historic deal with six world powers - China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - to limit its nuclear activities and allow monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief.",
      "However, Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the accord in 2018 and reinstated crippling US economic sanctions. He labelled it \"the worst deal in history\", saying it did too little to stop Iran's potential pathway to building a nuclear bomb.",
      "Iran responded by increasingly breaching the terms of the deal, particularly those limiting the production of enriched uranium, which can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants but also to build nuclear weapons.",
      "The IAEA said last month that Iran had stockpiled almost 275kg (606lb) of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is near weapons grade. That would theoretically be enough, if enriched to 90%, for six nuclear bombs.",
      "Both the US and Israel have warned that they will never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Israel has threatened to strike Iranian nuclear facilities if necessary.",
      "Last year, Israel said it hit part of Iran's nuclear programme during strikes that it carried out in response to an Iranian missile attack.",
      "In a TV interview broadcast last Friday, Trump said: \"There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran. They're great people.\"",
      "\"I have written them a letter saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate,' because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,\" he added.",
      "The White House has not given any details about the contents of the letter, which Iran said was handed to Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi by UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash.",
      "Although the supreme leader dismissed the idea of negotiations with the US, Iran's mission to the UN did say in a statement on Sunday that it might consider talks \"if the objective is... to address concerns vis-\u00e0-vis any potential militarisation of Iran's nuclear programme\".",
      "Araqchi also said on Wednesday that nuclear talks with the UK, France and Germany were \"ongoing\", while the Chinese foreign ministry said China, Russia and Iran would discuss the \"Iranian nuclear issue\" at a trilateral meeting in Beijing on Friday."

    "summary": "Zimbabwe's leader faces a backlash from key allies over efforts to extend his time in office.",
    "story": [
      "A long convoy of armoured personnel tanks rolling through a Harare neighbourhood sparked concerns - for a brief moment - that a military coup was afoot in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"What's going on in Zimbabwe?\" one person posted on social media. Another said: \"The last time this happened there was a coup.\"",
      "Government spokesman Nick Mangwana was quick to allay the public's fears, explaining the tanks were in the capital that mid-February morning as part of a scheduled exercise to test equipment and were \"nothing to be concerned about\".",
      "Yet the chatter and speculation continued, revealing much about the state of the country.",
      "Ahead of the routine military drill, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had, for the first time since becoming president in 2017, faced harsh criticism about his leadership from within his Zanu-PF party with calls for him to step down.",
      "The accusations evoked memories of the lead-up to the coup that toppled his predecessor, long-time leader Robert Mugabe.",
      "He had come to power in 1980 as the revolutionary hero who ended decades of white-minority rule. But his demise was heralded when veterans of the 1970s war of independence withdrew their support for him.",
      "It was a war veteran and senior Zanu-PF member named Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\", who launched a verbal offensive against Mnangagwa.",
      "He became angered when some within the party began pushing to change the country's laws to allow for the president to seek a third term.",
      "In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.",
      "\"I must apologise for helping him come into office,\" said Geza in one press conference aired on social media about the president, who goes by the nickname \"The Crocodile\".",
      "\"As soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people and only remembered his family,\" said the outspoken war veteran, who was then a member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee.",
      "\"Mnangagwa has also surrendered state power to his wife and children. We sadly see history repeating itself. We can't allow that to happen.\"",
      "Zanu-PF was outraged by his \"disloyal\" remarks - later described as \"amounting to treason\" - forcing Bombshell into hiding from where, through his representatives, he continues to make taunts via social media, hinting at protests.",
      "He is wanted by the police on four charges, including vehicle theft, undermining the authority of the president and inciting public violence.",
      "Blessed Mhlanga, the journalist who first interviewed Bombshell back in November, has also been arrested on charges of transmitting a message that incites violence.",
      "Trouble began brewing over Mnangagwa's ambitions to stay in office during Zanu-PF rallies last year. The president is currently serving his second and final term, which expires in 2028.",
      "The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be uttered by his supporters despite Zimbabwe's constitution limiting presidential terms to two five-year terms.",
      "They argued that he would need to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme as he was doing such great work.",
      "A motion was then adopted unanimously at Zanu-PF's conference in December that did not explicitly speak of a third term but sought to extend Mnangagwa's existing term until 2030.",
      "Despite a recent assurance from Mnangagwa that he did intend to step down in three years, the influential Roman Catholic bishops have become involved.",
      "In a pastoral letter last week, Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference warned that the 2030 debate was a distraction from the things that truly mattered - business closures, high unemployment, rampant corruption and economic policies that favour the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.",
      "Presidential spokesman George Charamba expressed his disappointment about the clerics' pronouncement, telling the state-run Herald newspaper the matter was now \"dead and buried\".",
      "Nonetheless, Bombshell's message seems to have landed. It has resulted in a purge in Zanu-PF, with the expulsion of Geza and some of his allies.",
      "Yet political analyst Takura Zhangazha says Geza's outburst is unlikely to galvanise crowds to his cause.",
      "These days people are less interested in such political spectacles, he says, unlike at the time of Mugabe's downfall when Zimbabweans, including opposition party supporters, turned out en masse to support the coup - thanking the military and the war veterans.",
      "\"Even that attempt by Geza to talk about corruption and the plight of the workers - it's not going to get people riled up, organising, mobilising. They don't have that capacity or interest any more,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I can promise you there's no repeat of 2017 before 2028,\" he said, adding that Zimbabweans feel they were used in the ousting of Mugabe  and would not be brought out on the streets again for Zanu-PF's internal battles.",
      "This is also because there are splits across the political landscape, including a weak opposition.",
      "Even the war veterans do not represent a united front, Mr Zhangazha says.",
      "Geza has previously voiced support in the succession debate for Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, the 68-year-old former army chief, but other war veterans are known to back the 2030 agenda.",
      "Political analyst Alexander Rusero says it is important to understand the war veterans' influential role in both Zimbabwe and Zanu-PF.",
      "\"They see themselves as caretakers, so you can't wish away their sentiments,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "However, he believes that the current grievances aired by the likes of Bombshell are prompted more by self-regard than public interest.",
      "\"They feel as if they are excluded from the cake that they should otherwise be enjoying,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Zhangazha agrees that those who show loyalty within the governing party are likely to benefit from things like tenders, government contracts, access to housing, land and agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and seeds.",
      "For Jameson Timba, the leader of a faction of the main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), it all sums up the state of politics in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"You have a country where the economic situation is deteriorating. People can hardly afford more than one meal a day,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We have major supermarket chains which are literally closing down,\" he said, referencing the economic woes facing OK Zimbabwe, one of the country's biggest retailers that has been forced to close several big branches with empty shelves in others.",
      "Mr Zhangazha noted the forecast for the fragile economy looks even more grim thanks to the fallout from the recent suspension of USAID.",
      "Timba is still recovering from a five-month stint in jail, spending most of his incarceration sitting on a concrete floor, sharing a cell and toilet with 80 people.",
      "He was arrested in June, along with more than 70 others, for hosting an \"unlawful meeting\" at his private residence when he held a barbeque to mark the International Day of the African Child.",
      "His treatment - and those of his fellow detainees - reflected how opposition politics was being criminalised, he told the BBC.",
      "\"The country is facing challenges. Any leader or government worth his salt would actually call for an early election, to check and determine whether they still have the mandate of the people,\" he said.",
      "\"To do the opposite represents a joke essentially [when] you're talking about extending a term of office.\"",
      "However, there is little chance of an early vote.",

      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",

      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

      "Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declined to be drawn into specifics, saying that \"the formation of the position of the Russian Federation [would] take place inside the Russian Federation\".",
      "And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov skirted the issue. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he said, adding Moscow was \"acquainting itself\" with the joint statement issued in Jeddah.",
      "There are reports that US envoy Steve Witkoff could travel to Moscow on Thursday, and Peskov said the press would be kept informed. Other than this, it was no comment from the Kremlin.",
      "President Vladimir Putin is no doubt thinking carefully about whether to accept the ceasefire proposal, reject it, or demand amendments to it.",
      "The idea of turning down - or amending - the ceasefire proposal seems to be gaining most traction among commentators.",
      "\"If [Putin] accepts the US suggestion, it will lead to a dangerous situation,\" pro-Kremlin pundit and former Putin aide Sergei Markov told the BBC, arguing that the Russian army currently has the upper hand on the front line and may lose it.",
      "There are also concerns that Ukraine could use the month-long ceasefire to rearm, so Russia may put forward some conditions, such as demanding an end to the Western supply of weapons to Kyiv.",

The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe.",
      "The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains.",

      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",

      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",

      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of people have been gathering in southern Ethiopia for one of the country's biggest cultural events.",
      "The week-long Gada ceremony, which ended on Sunday, sees the official transfer of power from one customary ruler to his successor - something that happens every eight years.",
      "The tradition of regularly appointing a new Abbaa Gadaa has been practised by the Borana community for centuries - and sees them gather at the rural site of Arda Jila Badhasa, near the Ethiopian town of Arero.",
      "It is a time to celebrate their special form of democracy as well as their cultural heritage, with each age-group taking the opportunity to wear their different traditional outfits.",
      "These are paraded the day before the official handover during a procession when married women march with wooden batons, called \"siinqee\".",
      "The batons have symbolic values of protection for women, who use them during conflict.",
      "If a siinqee stick is placed on the ground by a married woman between two quarrelling parties, it means the conflict must stop immediately out of respect.",
      "During the procession, younger women walk at the front, distinguished from the married women by the different colour of their clothing.",
      "In this pastoralist society, women are excluded from holding the top position of Abbaa Gadaa, sitting on the council of elders or being initiated into the system as a child.",
      "But their important role can be seen during the festival as they build all the accommodation for those staying for the week - and prepare all the food.",
      "And the unique Gada system of governance, which was added to the UN's cultural heritage list in 2016, allows for them to attend regular community meetings and to voice their opinions to the Abbaa Gadaa.",
      "Gada membership is only open to boys whose fathers are already members - young initiates have their heads shaven at the crown to make their rank clear.",
      "The smaller the circle, the older he is.",
      "As the global cultural body Unesco reports, oral historians teach young initiates about \"history, laws, rituals, time reckoning, cosmology, myths, rules of conduct, and the function of the Gada system\".",
      "Training for boys begins as young as eight years old.",
      "Later, they will be assessed for their potential as future leaders.",
      "As they grow up, tests include walking long distances barefoot, slaughtering cattle efficiently and showing kindness to fellow initiates.",
      "Headpieces made from cowrie shells are traditionally worn by young trainees. The only other people allowed to wear them are elderly women.",
      "Both groups are revered by Borana community members.",
      "Men aged between 28 and 32 are identified by the ostrich feathers they wear, which are known in the Afaan Oromo language as \"baalli\".",
      "Their attendance at the Gada ceremony is an opportunity to learn, prepare and bond as it is already known who from this age-group will be named Abbaa Gadaa in 2033.",
      "The main event at the recent Gada ceremony was the handover of power, from the outgoing 48-year-old Abbaa Gadaa to his younger successor.",
      "Well-wishers crossed the border from Kenya and others travelled from as far as Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to witness the spectacle. The governor of Kenya's Marsabit county was among the honoured guests.",
      "Thirty-seven-year-old Guyo Boru Guyo, seen here in white, holding a spear, was chosen to lead because he impressed the council of elders during his teenage years.",
      "He becomes the 72nd Abbaa Gadaa and will now oversee the Borana people who live in both southern Ethiopia and north-western Kenya.",
      "As their top diplomat, he will also be responsible for solving the feuds that may emerge in the pastoralist community.",
      "These often involve cattle-raiding and disputes over access to water in this drought-prone region.",
      "During his eight years at the helm, his successor will finish his training to take on the job in continuation of this generations-old tradition.",

    "summary": "Actor and comedian Mo Amer explains why he avoided mentioning the 7 October attack in the show's storyline.",
    "story": [
      "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.",
      "Pride and hurt.",
      "\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.",
      "The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.",
      "Making a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.",
      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",
      "There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.",
      "The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.",
      "That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",
      "This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says.",
      "The show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.",
      "\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.",
      "'I never lose hope'",
      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",
      "There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.",
      "\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.",
      "\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"",
      "The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.",
      "It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.",
      "From his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Mo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.",
      "The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.",
      "Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",
      "Israel occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.",
      "Palestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.",
      "\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.",
      "He adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.",
      "Mo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.",
      "He says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.",
      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",
      "Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.",
      "\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.",
      "\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"",
      "Mo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".",
      "\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.",
      "\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"",
      "The ceasefire agreement in Gaza has provided some hope that there could be an end to fighting, but it has also felt fragile with concern that deal could collapse.",
      "Mo says he is \"always hopeful\" things can get better.",
      "\"I never lose hope.",
      "\"If you do, then it becomes a really, really sad place whenever you're devoid of hope,\" he says.",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",

      "Remember \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the album?\u00a0 Even if you don't, now there's \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" the musical, an exuberant blast from the past \u2013 old Cuban music for a new audience. The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts.\n Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch\n, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",

      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",

Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",

      "And he knows all about live TV. For Mulaney, \"Saturday Night Live\" is home turf. He started as a writer there in 2008, and helped create some of the show's biggest characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon. Mulaney would often change the script at the last second to throw Hader off, like during this Halloween skit:",
      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",

      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that.

    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team\n, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026\n.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity\n. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% on an annual basis, slightly lower than economists had forecast but continuing to signal that price hikes remain elevated despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis\n.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports\n\u00a0could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.",
      "Anything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.",
      "\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices.

      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans\n, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency,\n or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",

Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview\n on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs\n at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration\n of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",

      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",

      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate\n after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",

The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in those prices over time, has cooled considerably from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but continues to eclipse the index's pre-pandemic levels.",
      "February's data reflects the first full month of the Trump administration, although some of Mr. Trump's economic policies have yet to take effect, such as his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, now set to kick in on April 2 after a one-month reprieve\n. Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025\n due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",
      "The ongoing rise in food prices is posing a challenge to some U.S. households, particularly among lower-income consumers who spend a greater share of their income on groceries than higher-earning Americans, according to a new Bank of America Institute analysis of consumer spending.",
      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan\n to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "But while egg prices could see some relief in Wednesday's inflation report, food prices are still on the rise, economists say. On a month-over-month basis, food costs likely rose 0.3%, Vanguard said on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans themselves are bracing for higher grocery costs, according to the March 10 release of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",
      "Consumers bracing for a reignition of inflation could be feeding into a sharp downturn of consumer confidence, which plummeted in February\n to its lowest level in four years. More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",
      "\"Households expressed more pessimism about their year-ahead financial situations in February, while unemployment, delinquency and credit access expectations deteriorated notably,\" the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. \"Meanwhile, spending growth expectations rose significantly.\"",

      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-overpayment-clawback-100-percent-medicare-trump-doge-waiver/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan\n to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship\n for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars\n. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:23:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will restart a policy that had caused financial distress for some beneficiaries.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments\n to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars\n.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\n\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes\n,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare.",
      "\"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",
      "Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans.",
      "\"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.\"",
      "Social Security cuts",
      "The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services\n, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.",
      "While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out \"fraud\" from the benefit system.",
      "\"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,\" he said. \"We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,\" he added, referring to a false claim\n that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.\"",
      "The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement.",
      "\"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

    "story": [
      "Airbus is investigating corrosion issues on some of its A220 passenger jets. The issue has been found on what the manufacturer calls a \"limited population\" of A220s, including some operated by U.S. airlines. The manufacturer and multiple airlines said the issue does not constitute an immediate safety issue.",
      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator\n, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses\n, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose\n 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens\n if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",
      "He says his company has 23 plants and 2,000 partner farms in seven states, employing 26,000 people across the Southeast and processing 21 million broiler chickens a week for sale of their meat into the consumer market.",
      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices\n more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island\n. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979\n. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons\n. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power\n.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored\n. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rates-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-trump/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:05:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth\n. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed\n to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025\n, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\n\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\n\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs\n and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers\n on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on\n some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025\n was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "summary": "More restrictive trade and immigration policies under the Trump administration could mean higher prices for Americans, Morgan Stanley analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\n\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\n\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981\n, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase\n. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs\n on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",
      "Persistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates\n at its next meeting on March 19.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has pardoned a former Republican Tennessee lawmaker who was two weeks into a 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former state Sen. Brian Kelsey announced the pardon in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24.",
      "Kelsey received a \"full and unconditional pardon\" for his case and authorities were ordered to release him from prison immediately, according to a copy of the president's action provided by Kelsey's attorney.",
      "\"May God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\" Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \"God used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\" referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \"unsure heart and a confused mind.\" He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "Kelsey also accepted the plea deal because his then-attorneys advised that he would likely receive probation, according to a statement Wednesday from an attorney now representing Kelsey.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn't understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey's challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \"unconditional admission of guilt\" under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he received the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \"cooperate fully and truthfully.\" He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey's state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey's 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey's campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center's director of federal campaign finance reform, said Mr. Trump's pardon of Kelsey \"demonstrates an open hostility and contempt for accountability and the rule of law.\"",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn't seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

    "summary": "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil\u200b, a former Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian protester, is raising questions about the rights of green card holders.",
    "story": [
      "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil\n, a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, is raising questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil\n, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil has not been charged with a crime. The Trump administration argues it can deport him on foreign policy grounds.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document obtained by CBS News shows this is the provision the Trump administration is using to justify Khalil's arrest.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza\n.",
      "Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" she said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",
      "Khalil's attorneys are trying to reverse his transfer to Louisiana, calling it \"blatantly improper.\"",

      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal\n of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed\n across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies\n immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies\n typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",

      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\n suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",

      "In an order following Wednesday's conference, Furman said that Khalil cannot be removed from the U.S. \"unless and until this court orders otherwise.\"",
      "Furman gave attorneys for both sides until noon on March 14 to file a joint letter proposing next steps in the case.",
      "Amy Greer, Khalil's attorney, said officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke Khalil's student visa and green card. Khalil was sent to a detention center in Jena, Louisiana. He will not be present at the New York hearing, his lawyers said.",
      "According to a Department of Homeland Security notice to appear issued Sunday and obtained by CBS News on Wednesday, DHS wrote that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has \"determined\" that Khalil's \"presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Khalil graduated in December with a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. The 30-year-old is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant.",
      "Khalil's wife said in a statement that, even before his arrest, \"this last week has been a nightmare.\"",
      "She described experiencing \"an intense and targeted doxxing campaign\" focused on \"spreading false claims about my husband that were simply not based in reality.\" She said Khalil had been seeking legal help for that in the days before a federal agent approached them outside\u00a0 their apartment building and handcuffed Khalil.",
      "President Trump said Monday that Khalil's arrest was just the first \"of many to come\"\n amid the White House's crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" protesting Israel's war with the terror group Hamas.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Khalil was \"given the privilege of coming to this country to study at one of our nation's finest universities and colleges \u2013 and he took advantage of that opportunity, of that privilege by siding with terrorists.\"",
      "Leavitt alleged that Khalil had distributed flyers on Columbia's campus that were \"pro-Hamas.\"",
      "\"We have a zero-tolerance policy of siding with terrorists, period,\" Leavitt said.",
      "While Khalil has been accused of making statements in support of Hamas, he has not been publicly accused of providing any material support. His lawyers say he's being punished for exercising protected speech.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said Monday in a statement that Khalil was \"chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Rubio said Tuesday morning that the case is \"not about free speech,\" adding \"this is about people that don't have a right to be in the United States to begin with.\"",
      "\"No one has a right to a student visa,\" Rubio said. \"No one has a right to a green card, by the way. So when you apply for student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down, and being complicit and what are clearly crimes of vandalization, complicit in shutting down learning institutions.\"",
      "Shortly after Khalil's arrest, Rubio posted on social media that \"we will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "Khalil's arrest came \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting antisemitism,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.",
      "The arrest was criticized by some students and professors at Columbia University and led to protests\n\u00a0in Manhattan. Supporters of Khalil also rallied across the street from the courthouse Wednesday, demanding his release.",
      "Katrina Armstrong, the school's interim president, called the arrest and the federal government's suspension of $400 million in federal funds\n due to alleged antisemitism on campus \"a challenging moment for our community\" in a message to the Columbia University community on Monday.",
      "\"All eyes are on Columbia at present. It falls to us to ensure our University, and indeed the values of higher education more broadly, survive and thrive,\" Armstrong wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to retaliate against a law firm that represented Hillary Clinton, ruling that an executive order the president\u00a0signed last week\n unlawfully targeted the Perkins Coie law firm and violated its First Amendment rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued a temporary restraining order that stops three parts of the executive order from being implemented against Perkins Coie \u2014 provisions that ban the firm's attorneys from entering government buildings, that restrict contact between federal officials and the firm's attorneys and that subject the firm's contracts with federal contractors to review by Trump administration agency heads.",
      "Dane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie, argued in court that the executive order is a \"wrecking ball\" and a \"tidal wave\" that would significantly damage the firm's ability to do work in Washington, D.C., in cases involving the federal government. Attorneys say there are thousands of ongoing cases related to over 90 government agencies. Butswinkas said that about 25% of the firm's work is related to government work.",
      "Perkins Coie sued the Trump administration this week, arguing that the executive order violated the firm's constitutional protections of free speech and association. The firm represented Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign\n against Mr. Trump, and in the course of the campaign, contracted with a research firm that produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier\n.\" The controversial dossier contained salacious and unproven allegations highlighting alleged links between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.",
      "Butswinkas also argued that the executive order would have a chilling effect in law firms across Washington, hampering their abilities to assist clients without fear of retaliation for litigating against the president or his administration.",
      "In an unusual move, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, argued on behalf of the Justice Department.",
      "Mizelle argued that Trump has the executive power to \"find that there are certain individuals or certain companies that are not trustworthy with the nation's secrets,\" and that Trump's decisions to go after the law firm are \"not reviewable\" by a court of law.",
      "\"That's a different Constitution than I am familiar with,\" Butswinkas retorted in his closing, adding, \"If left unchecked, we'll be left in a country we barely recognize.\"",
      "Howell criticized the Trump administration's actions in her ruling from the bench, saying that it \"sends little chills down my spine\" that the Trump administration claimed it has the executive power to label people as threats and bar them from engaging with the government. She noted that many of the lawyers who worked on the Trump-related cases have since departed the firm, and the language was overly broad in targeting the firm.",
      "The executive order also stripped the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, but the law firm did not challenge that section in its suit.",
      "Perkins Coie is just one law firm that the Trump administration has targeted so far during his presidency. Last month, Mr. Trump signed another executive order that targeted Covington & Burling attorneys representing former special counsel Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor who brought criminal charges\n against Mr. Trump in a case involving his handling of classified documents and another regarding his actions in attempting to overturn the 2020 election\n.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, Trump mentioned Perkins Coie, saying his administration has \"a lot of law firms that we're going to go after because they were very dishonest people.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans on Wednesday that they do not have the votes to approve a House-passed stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with a fast-approaching Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a  partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said, while pushing for a vote on a shorter-term funding measure following a lengthy lunch meeting with his caucus to determine the path forward.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0approved the six-month funding measure\n\u00a0with the support of just one Democrat on Tuesday. The bill, known as a\u00a0continuing resolution\n, increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "With the House passage, the measure is now in the hands of the Senate, where Republicans, with a 53-seat majority, need support from Democrats to reach a 60-vote threshold to propel the measure to passage.",
      "Funding the government is usually a bipartisan effort. But Democrats widely oppose the measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts, while expressing frustration with the spending reductions.",
      "But Democrats aren't generally inclined to let the government shut down, either. And the House opted to cancel votes Wednesday and leave town, in hopes of preventing the Senate from changing the continuing resolution or passing a different version before Friday's deadline.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the House-passed measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk. That Democratic support could come from senators who represent states that President Trump won in November, who face added pressure to work across party lines.",
      "After their lunch meeting Wednesday, Senate Democrats said they want to see a vote on a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. On Monday, the top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11.",
      "\"I think people want to see a vote on the 30-day CR to let the process finish,\" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said after the meeting. \"I think there's still a chance, I believe, to get something done.\"",
      "Schumer then took to the Senate floor to outline that Democrats are \"unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" saying \"we should vote on that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats have limited leverage in the funding fight, and the move to deny votes may be a face-saving measure. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed opposition to the short-term continuing resolution Tuesday, saying it continues to \"punt the problem down the road.\"",
      "\"At this point there's really one solution on the table,\" Thune said, noting that the House-passed stopgap measure keeps the government open and addresses core issues. \"We think it represents the best solution at the moment.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson notched a major win when he kept his conference almost entirely united behind the counting resolution on Tuesday. He said at a news conference after the vote that he's hopeful Democrats will join Republicans to prevent a possible shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"I certainly hope that there are enough Democrats in the Senate who have a conscience who will do the right thing by the American people and take care of business over there,\" the speaker said.",

      "The move means the Environmental Justice Divisions within 10 EPA regional offices will be reorganized and eliminated. EPA headquarters already closed its\u00a0Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights \nin D.C. and placed 168 employees on administrative leave, although it did reinstate a handful of those people.",
      "In the memo, dated Tuesday, March 11, Zeldin said this action is in response to President Trump's executive order on \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferences,\" as well as two other executive actions.",
      "The EPA confirmed the closures at regional offices.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,\" Zeldin said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.\"",

      "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.",
      "Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.",
      "The university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"",
      "\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.",
      "A crackdown\n on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs\n in academia\n, government and across corporations\n have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.",
      "Vance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"",
      "\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"",
      "Vance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"",
      "The administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Many corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.",
      "Vance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.",
      "The president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.",
      "Vance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren.

      "\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"",
      "Chilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.",
      "\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"",
      "The popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.",
      "The course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.",
      "Her commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.",
      "\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Aamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.",
      "\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"",
      "That commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:",
      "\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk has accused some federal judges of being \"evil\" and said they should be fired after issuing preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.",
      "Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.",
      "Sullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Sutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.",
      "\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"",
      "Sutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"",
      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",
      "The concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Sullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.",
      "\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "When it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.",
      "The program was established after Congress passed legislation\n responding to the 2020 killing of the son\n of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve\n more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 23:05:01 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA will wait at least another two days to launch its next space station crew, delaying the return of Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams a bit longer.",
    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew on Friday.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth\n of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore\n and pilot Sunita Williams\n, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth\n. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts\n has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts\n will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected\n to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk\n blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September\n for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview\n. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5\n for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\n\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",

      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",

      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA.

    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander\n shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",

      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26\n atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon.

    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island\n. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979\n. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons\n. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power\n.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored\n. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "summary": "Brian Kelsey pleaded guilty to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has pardoned a former Republican Tennessee lawmaker who was two weeks into a 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former state Sen. Brian Kelsey announced the pardon in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24.",
      "Kelsey received a \"full and unconditional pardon\" for his case and authorities were ordered to release him from prison immediately, according to a copy of the president's action provided by Kelsey's attorney.",
      "\"May God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\" Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \"God used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\" referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \"unsure heart and a confused mind.\" He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "Kelsey also accepted the plea deal because his then-attorneys advised that he would likely receive probation, according to a statement Wednesday from an attorney now representing Kelsey.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn't understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey's challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \"unconditional admission of guilt\" under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he received the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \"cooperate fully and truthfully.\" He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey's state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey's 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey's campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center's director of federal campaign finance reform, said Mr. Trump's pardon of Kelsey \"demonstrates an open hostility and contempt for accountability and the rule of law.\"",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn't seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

    "story": [
      "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil\n, a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, is raising questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil\n, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil has not been charged with a crime. The Trump administration argues it can deport him on foreign policy grounds.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document obtained by CBS News shows this is the provision the Trump administration is using to justify Khalil's arrest.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza\n.",
      "Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" she said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",

But in the chaos\n of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal\n of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed\n across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies\n immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies\n typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\n suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to retaliate against a law firm that represented Hillary Clinton, ruling that an executive order the president\u00a0signed last week\n unlawfully targeted the Perkins Coie law firm and violated its First Amendment rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued a temporary restraining order that stops three parts of the executive order from being implemented against Perkins Coie \u2014 provisions that ban the firm's attorneys from entering government buildings, that restrict contact between federal officials and the firm's attorneys and that subject the firm's contracts with federal contractors to review by Trump administration agency heads.",
      "Dane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie, argued in court that the executive order is a \"wrecking ball\" and a \"tidal wave\" that would significantly damage the firm's ability to do work in Washington, D.C., in cases involving the federal government. Attorneys say there are thousands of ongoing cases related to over 90 government agencies. Butswinkas said that about 25% of the firm's work is related to government work.",
      "Perkins Coie sued the Trump administration this week, arguing that the executive order violated the firm's constitutional protections of free speech and association. The firm represented Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign\n against Mr. Trump, and in the course of the campaign, contracted with a research firm that produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier\n.\" The controversial dossier contained salacious and unproven allegations highlighting alleged links between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.",
      "Butswinkas also argued that the executive order would have a chilling effect in law firms across Washington, hampering their abilities to assist clients without fear of retaliation for litigating against the president or his administration.",
      "In an unusual move, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, argued on behalf of the Justice Department.",
      "Mizelle argued that Trump has the executive power to \"find that there are certain individuals or certain companies that are not trustworthy with the nation's secrets,\" and that Trump's decisions to go after the law firm are \"not reviewable\" by a court of law.",
      "\"That's a different Constitution than I am familiar with,\" Butswinkas retorted in his closing, adding, \"If left unchecked, we'll be left in a country we barely recognize.\"",
      "Howell criticized the Trump administration's actions in her ruling from the bench, saying that it \"sends little chills down my spine\" that the Trump administration claimed it has the executive power to label people as threats and bar them from engaging with the government. She noted that many of the lawyers who worked on the Trump-related cases have since departed the firm, and the language was overly broad in targeting the firm.",
      "The executive order also stripped the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, but the law firm did not challenge that section in its suit.",
      "Perkins Coie is just one law firm that the Trump administration has targeted so far during his presidency. Last month, Mr. Trump signed another executive order that targeted Covington & Burling attorneys representing former special counsel Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor who brought criminal charges\n against Mr. Trump in a case involving his handling of classified documents and another regarding his actions in attempting to overturn the 2020 election\n.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, Trump mentioned Perkins Coie, saying his administration has \"a lot of law firms that we're going to go after because they were very dishonest people.\"",

      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.",
      "Gym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.",
      "Higher price for aluminum cans",
      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans\n, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans on Wednesday that they do not have the votes to approve a House-passed stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with a fast-approaching Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a  partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said, while pushing for a vote on a shorter-term funding measure following a lengthy lunch meeting with his caucus to determine the path forward.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0approved the six-month funding measure\n\u00a0with the support of just one Democrat on Tuesday. The bill, known as a\u00a0continuing resolution\n, increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "With the House passage, the measure is now in the hands of the Senate, where Republicans, with a 53-seat majority, need support from Democrats to reach a 60-vote threshold to propel the measure to passage.",
      "Funding the government is usually a bipartisan effort. But Democrats widely oppose the measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts, while expressing frustration with the spending reductions.",
      "But Democrats aren't generally inclined to let the government shut down, either. And the House opted to cancel votes Wednesday and leave town, in hopes of preventing the Senate from changing the continuing resolution or passing a different version before Friday's deadline.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the House-passed measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk. That Democratic support could come from senators who represent states that President Trump won in November, who face added pressure to work across party lines.",
      "After their lunch meeting Wednesday, Senate Democrats said they want to see a vote on a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. On Monday, the top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11.",
      "\"I think people want to see a vote on the 30-day CR to let the process finish,\" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said after the meeting. \"I think there's still a chance, I believe, to get something done.\"",
      "Schumer then took to the Senate floor to outline that Democrats are \"unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" saying \"we should vote on that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats have limited leverage in the funding fight, and the move to deny votes may be a face-saving measure. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed opposition to the short-term continuing resolution Tuesday, saying it continues to \"punt the problem down the road.\"",
      "\"At this point there's really one solution on the table,\" Thune said, noting that the House-passed stopgap measure keeps the government open and addresses core issues. \"We think it represents the best solution at the moment.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson notched a major win when he kept his conference almost entirely united behind the counting resolution on Tuesday. He said at a news conference after the vote that he's hopeful Democrats will join Republicans to prevent a possible shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"I certainly hope that there are enough Democrats in the Senate who have a conscience who will do the right thing by the American people and take care of business over there,\" the speaker said.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:11:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CDC said 69 passengers and 16 crew on board the Princess Cruises ship Coral Princess reported falling ill with norovirus during a recent voyage.",
    "story": [
      "Another norovirus outbreak sickened passengers on board the cruise ship Coral Princess in February, marking the second outbreak this year on the ocean liner operated by Princess Cruises, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Sixty-nine passengers and 16 crew members fell ill during the February outbreak, the CDC said. There were 1,906 passengers and 895 crew members on the ship overall. The outbreak happened during a 16-night voyage from Los Angeles, California, through the Panama Canal.",
      "Cases reported on the recent trip were considered \"mild,\" a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"At the earliest signs of illness, we promptly enacted enhanced sanitization protocols, including comprehensive disinfection, isolating affected guests, and offering health guidance to everyone on board,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It was unclear whether those who reported developing symptoms on the ship became sick at the same time, or at different points along their journey. The Coral Princess left Los Angeles on Feb. 21 and returned March 9 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to the CDC. After arriving in Fort Lauderdale, crew members disinfected the ship prior to its next voyage, the spokesperson said.",
      "Princess Cruises told the CDC that crew members took additional steps to minimize the spread of norovirus once it was detected on the Coral Princess, including testing people with norovirus symptoms, the agency said. Their response to the outbreak was guided by the CDC's vessel sanitation program, which monitored the situation remotely. The program is a resource for cruise companies to prevent and manage public health problems on ships.",
      "Norovirus, also known as a stomach bug, is a highly infectious disease that typically causes symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Symptoms usually last between one and three days, but a person can still transmit the notoriously contagious virus to others for two weeks or longer after their symptoms subside, the CDC said on its website.",
      "Outbreaks of norovirus are often seen on cruise ships\n, in congregate living situations like jails and nursing homes, and in other places like schools where groups are gathered close together. As cases of the illness surged around the U.S. toward the end of last year, the CDC reported hundreds of cruise passengers\n caught the virus on three different ships in December alone. One of those outbreaks happened on a Princess Cruises ship, the Ruby Princess, as it sailed around Hawaii. The other two affected Holland America's Rotterdam and Zuiderdam on voyages through the Caribbean.",
      "The CDC said more norovirus outbreaks spread on cruise ships in December 2024 than any other month last year. In total, the agency tracked 14 norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships in 2024, several of which occurred on trips run by Princess Cruises. In December, about 100 passengers and 12 crew reported being ill during the Ruby Princess outbreak, after an outbreak on the Coral Princess in November where\u00a055 passengers and 15 crew\n\u00a0came down with the virus.",
      "Princess Cruises' latest outbreak is the second since the start of 2025 on the Coral Princess. In January, another voyage on the same ship saw 128 passengers and 20 crew on board develop the virus, the CDC said.",

    "summary": "Robert Davis was the last person to see his girlfriend Barbara Lenz alive before she vanished in 1989, Iowa investigators said.",
    "story": [
      "The former boyfriend of an Iowa woman who vanished 36 years ago has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in her disappearance, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Robert Davis, who is now 61 and lives in Council Bluffs, Iowa, was arrested Monday in the case of Barbara Lenz, 31, who was last seen on May 6, 1989, the Iowa Department of Justice said in a news release. Davis, who was Lenz' boyfriend at the time, reported dropping her off at her apartment in Woodbine, Iowa, that day. Lenz was then expected to visit her former boyfriend and the father of her 3-year-old child in Omaha, Nebraska, but she didn't show up, according to the release.",
      "Lenz's family contacted the Woodbine Police Department on May 17. Police and family members entered Lenz's apartment and found her pets had not been cared for \"in some time,\" according to a criminal complaint. Her personal effects, including her purse and wallet, were in the home. There were no signs of a struggle.",
      "Police determined that Davis was the last person to have seen Lenz alive, according to the complaint. He told investigators Lenz had called him from Omaha to say she was with her daughter, but police determined she never arrived there.",
      "During the course of the investigation, police found that Lenz had told several people she feared Davis, the complaint said. Shortly before her disappearance, Lenz told at least two people that Davis said he would kill her if she left him, according to the complaint.",
      "Lenz was also allegedly assaulted by Davis \"on several known occasions\" during their two-year relationship, according to the complaint, including incidents during which she was allegedly strangled until she fell unconscious. There was also an incident where Davis allegedly hit Lenz's daughter at a restaurant in front of Lenz and other witnesses. Davis admitted these incidents to police, the complaint said.",
      "Davis told police he did not like Lenz going to Nebraska to see her daughter and ex-boyfriend, the complaint said, and several fights and assaults by Davis allegedly followed her visits. Davis said they had argued before her May 6 visit, according to the complaint. There were witnesses to the argument. One witness said Davis injured Lenz by slashing her across the cheek with a sharp object. Another witness reported seeing Lenz and Davis leaving the apartment complex together.",
      "One witness told investigators that Davis' brother showed them a spot in a rural area where he and Davis had buried something wrapped in plastic. The complaint did not say if the area was excavated or what was wrapped in the plastic.",
      "Other witnesses told investigators that Davis told them they would \"end up like Barbara\" after arguments. The statements were made long after Lenz's disappearance, the complaint said.",
      "Lenz's body has never been found. Investigators \"pursued numerous leads and searches\" over the years, to no avail, the Iowa Department of Justice said. In July 2024, the Attorney General's office launched an Iowa Cold Case Unit to investigate unsolved crimes. The unit investigated Lenz's case and \"brought fresh eyes and a focused team to dig through information, meet with witnesses, and loosen up leads.\"",
      "That led investigators to Davis. The complaint alleges that because of Davis' behavior and history with Lenz, investigators believe he murdered Lenz \"with malice aforethought, wilfully, deliberately, and with premeditation.\"",
      "An attorney was not listed for Davis.",
      "\"Something I have waited for my whole life\"",
      "The case will be prosecuted in Harrison County, the Iowa Department of Justice said. Davis is being held without bond in the Harrison County Jail,\u00a0CBS News affiliate KCCI reported.",
      "Lenz's daughter, Lindsy Baumgart, told KCCI that Davis' arrest is \"surreal\" and that she is \"grateful\" for the investigation.",
      "\"I never thought this day would come,\" she told KCCI. \"It's honestly something that I have waited for my whole life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin\n is \"eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental justice offices and positions immediately,\" according to screenshots of an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The move means the Environmental Justice Divisions within 10 EPA regional offices will be reorganized and eliminated. EPA headquarters already closed its\u00a0Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights \nin D.C. and placed 168 employees on administrative leave, although it did reinstate a handful of those people.",
      "In the memo, dated Tuesday, March 11, Zeldin said this action is in response to President Trump's executive order on \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferences,\" as well as two other executive actions.",
      "The EPA confirmed the closures at regional offices.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,\" Zeldin said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.\"",
      "\"Our goal at EPA is going to be to remediate these environmental issues directly,\" Zeldin told CBS News at a press availability. \"We're not going to discriminate. We're not going to make people give us 1000 questions about their their background in order to qualify for support, we want everyone to qualify for support.\"",
      "It's not yet clear exactly how many people will lose their jobs with the EPA as a result of the closures. Exact staffing levels across the country are unknown, but sources tell CBS News there were roughly 200 total people employed at environmental justice\n offices in DC and the 10 regional locations. The EPA confirmed to CBS News that all employees in these regional offices will be placed on administrative leave.",
      "\"Generations of progress are being erased from our federal government,\" said Matthew Tejada, who was the deputy assistant administrator at the Office of Environmental Justice for over a decade before leaving the EPA in December 2023. \"The individuals with institutional knowledge and have long developed connections and trust within these communities are being erased.\"",
      "The EPA established the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights in 1992 under former President George H.W. Bush to address \"disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations.\"",
      "The Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights has undergone several reorganizations throughout the years, but it was broadly expanded in 2022 under former President Joe Biden. In September 2022, the office received a $3 billion grant from the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed it to become a national program with regional offices in 10 locations to expand the department's work within impacted communities that are harmed by environmental pollution.",
      "\"It will be incredibly hard to attract individuals who are brave enough to show their faces to these communities,\" said Tejada, who now serves as the senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Many of the neighborhoods served by the regional Environmental Justice offices have a mistrust of the government and restoring that relationship will be nearly impossible, Tejada said.",
      "\"The government is being shut down right in front of us and it is catastrophic and no one is calling it out,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview\n on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs\n at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration\n of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

It is a popular pet but is one of the most invasive species in the world because owners often release them into the wild, according to the the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium. The turtles can live between 20 and 30 years, and are named for a distinctive reddish stripe behind each eye. Red-ear slider turtles can weigh up to two pounds and range in length from five to 11 inches. The species is not endangered.",

      "A crackdown\n on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs\n in academia\n, government and across corporations\n have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.",
      "Vance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"",
      "\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"",
      "Vance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"",
      "The administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Many corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.",
      "Vance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.",
      "The president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.",
      "Vance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.",
      "\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"",
      "Chilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.",
      "\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"",
      "The popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.",
      "The course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.",
      "Her commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.",
      "\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Aamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.",
      "\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"",
      "That commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:",
      "\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\"",

But in the chaos\n of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal\n of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed\n across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies\n immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies\n typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\n suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve\n more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 a.m. and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m. ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",

    "summary": "Terrorists in explosive vests have reportedly threatened Pakistan train passengers' lives if officials refuse to release imprisoned militants.",
    "story": [
      "Quetta, Pakistan \u2014\u00a0Pakistani security forces managed Wednesday to free most of the hostages who had been held on a train that was hijacked the previous day by separatist militants in the country's remote southwest, officials said. At least 30 of the militants were killed, in addition to 21 security personnel who had been aboard the train, a security official in Quetta told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai.",
      "Authorities had earlier said that about 190 of the roughly 450 passengers who were initially on the train had been rescued and were being moved to safety. More than 100 other passengers made it off the train on Tuesday. While the 21 security forces killed were apparently on the train as passengers, the official in Quetta told Yousafzai that no civilians had been killed in the attack.",
      "Militants wearing vests loaded with explosives had earlier surrounded the remaining 250 or so hostages after the attack on the train, which happened as it entered a tunnel Tuesday in Bolan, a district in the restive Balochistan province.",
      "The Baloch Liberation Army, a U.S. and Pakistani-designated terrorist organization that has waged a yearslong insurgency in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch said earlier that the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agree to release jailed militants.",
      "Authorities said those rescued Wednesday included women and children. The security official in Quetta told CBS News the terrorists may have been able to identify off-duty security personnel on the train by obtaining information relating to which passengers were traveling on discounted fares offered to such forces.",
      "According to officials who spoke earlier with The Associated Press, the train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks and immobilized the engine and its nine coaches. The driver was critically wounded by gunfire and guards aboard the train were attacked, although the officials gave no details on the number of guards who were aboard, or their fate.",
      "A security officer in provincial capital of Quetta told CBS News' Yousafzai previously that the militants had split the hostages into small groups and that they were using them as human shields. The BLA warned that the life of hostages would be at risk if the government did not negotiate a release of prisoners.",
      "Local residents reported seeing dozens of coffins being transported to the area on another train, raising fears of mass casualties.",
      "One passenger, Muhammad Bashir, told local media that militants stormed the train and ordered families to leave. As he was with his family, Bashir said, the assailants told all of them to walk away and not look back.",
      "Passengers who made it out of the train on Tuesday were sent to their hometowns, while the wounded were being treated at hospitals in Balochistan's Mach district. Others were taken to Quetta, a major city about 60 miles away.",
      "The train was traveling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar when the attack took place.",
      "A hotspot for insurgencies",
      "Government spokesman Shahid Rind said helicopters were backing up Pakistani forces in the rugged region and described the attack as \"an act of terrorism.\" It is the first time that the BLA has hijacked a train.",
      "The government has rejected militant-prisoner swap demands in the past.",
      "Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long been a hotspot for separatist insurgencies against the leadership of all three countries, with militants demanding greater autonomy and a larger share of the region's natural resources.",
      "The main insurgencies, however, have centered on Pakistan and Iran. Each country's government suspects the others of supporting \u2014 or at least tolerating \u2014 some of the groups operating on the other side of the respective borders.",
      "In Iran, the militant group Jaish al-Adl has carried out many attacks in recent years. Tehran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from Jaish al-Adl, and Pakistan also wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters. In January 2024, the two nations engaged in a tit-for-tat airstrike targeting insurgents inside each other's border areas, killing at least 11 people, but later they quickly deescalated the situation through talks",
      "Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board as members of the military frequently use them to travel from Quetta to other parts of the country. Militants have attacked trains in the past but have never managed to hijack one.",
      "In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.",
      "Pakistani authorities and analysts estimate that the BLA has around 3,000 fighters.",
      "Analysts have said the train attack, putting so many civilians in danger, could backfire for the BLA.",
      "\"After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective,\" said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.",
      "The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces, but has also in the past attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC.",

      "They run businesses. They tend bars. They pay taxes. While they are in the U.S. illegally, they are largely spared the scrutiny of that label. But still they live in fear. They are the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants in America today.",
      "Recent estimates from the Irish government suggest that there are as many as 10,000 undocumented Irish immigrants across the United States. Many have lived in the shadows for decades, waiting for a pathway to citizenship that may never come. And with a new president that has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation\n in U.S. history, anxieties have been heightened.",
      "\"It's definitely a concern, definitely a worry,\" Mary, an undocumented Irish immigrant in New England, told CBS News. \"I've heard of different people, you know, getting caught up in a swoop of undocumented people \u2014 some of them may be criminals, but some of them may not be, and it's just a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",
      "Mary, and others interviewed for this story, asked that their full names not be used to maintain their anonymity.",
      "Irish privilege?",
      "While Mary fears for her own status, she says communities of color are bearing the brunt of President Trump's immigration crackdown\n while she can somewhat fly under the radar.",
      "\"There's some very hardworking people that have set up businesses and are employing people and all of a sudden, you know, they're on a plane somewhere\n, their lives have changed, and it's very hard,\" she said. \"I absolutely do feel for people.\"",
      "Aisling, an undocumented Irish waitress in Chicago, who has lived in America for eight years, says that while she is concerned she may become a \"collateral damage\" target for the administration, ICE raids\n in her neighborhood have targeted predominantly Latino communities \u2014 something she has condemned as racist.",
      "\"If ICE were to walk into my work, I could definitely just blend in with the crowd, but the fear for me is getting pulled over or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment as to how ICE conducts its enforcement operations and whether the characterization that they are specifically targeting Hispanic and Latino communities is a fair one.",
      "Mick, who arrived in New York from Ireland in 2000, said public treatment of Irish people in the U.S. was in many ways the opposite of what other nationalities face. \"I used to find it quite unfair hearing how locals would speak about these immigrants coming here,\" he explained. \"I'd have to remind them, say, 'Hey guys, I'm an immigrant.'\" The attitude, he said, was, \"'Yeah, but you're different.'\"",
      "Mick was undocumented for the first few years he lived in the U.S., but he is now a citizen and describes himself as a proud New Yorker. He said there was a \"much broader fear\" among immigrant communities now during the second Trump administration.",
      "\"There's tips being posted online \u2026 for people to report businesses if they suspect there's undocumented people working. It's horrible. There's definitely a feeling here, which is new and not nice,\" he said.",
      "Ciara, who arrived in the U.S. before President Trump took office, said she was on a J-1 visa, which allows for educational and cultural exchange, but working illegally on the side. \"There is a bit of a safety net\" for Irish people in the hospitality industry, she said.",
      "\"It definitely is a worry, but I think I am definitely very privileged as well. I'm a White Irish girl with a third-level [college] education, so I think I'm in a lot more secure position to a lot of other people who are undocumented.\"",
      "But immigration attorneys have told CBS News that it would be naive for Irish undocumented people to believe that they may be immune to deportation.",
      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",
      "Contribution to the American economy",
      "Tom, a New York bar owner and legal resident in Manhattan, told CBS News that he has employed many undocumented Irish workers as well as undocumented Central and South American staff in his pub over the years. He says he couldn't operate as a business owner without them.",
      "\"I'd say 90% of the restaurants and small businesses in this city would close down if you took away the [undocumented] immigrants,\" Tom said. \"The folks who want to do those jobs are people that don't have clear legal paths into America.\"",
      "An estimate from the American Immigration Council showed that undocumented immigrants in America contributed $75.6 billion in taxes in 2022. That included $29 billion in state and local taxes and $46.6 billion in federal taxes.",
      "Aisling, in Chicago, says her colleagues at the bar where she works are predominantly undocumented.",
      "\"The business relies on it, basically \u2026 people coming in applying for jobs here, it's not Americans coming in and applying. They don't want to do these jobs,\" she said.",
      "Legal pathways for undocumented immigrants are limited",
      "Mary, in New England, arrived in the U.S. in 1999. In the 26 years that she has lived in America, she has become a property owner and is self-employed.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, she has been trying to obtain sponsorship for legal residency through a legal petition from her brother, who is an American citizen. That process is still pending with no end in sight.",
      "\"There isn't really any opportunities,\" she said. \"There isn't a path right now for me.\"",
      "It's an issue facing many undocumented immigrants working in the United States today, where few legal pathways\n exist, and where they do, massive backlogs\n and bureaucracy cause long processing delays.",
      "A 2023 policy analysis\u00a0from the conservative think tank the Cato Institute said that fewer than 1% of people who want to move permanently to the United States can do so legally.",
      "One young Irish woman who overstayed her visa waiver in New York and is now working in a bar in Manhattan told CBS News that she just wants to work, but the avenues are limited.",
      "\"I would prefer to be legal and have legal status, but it was hard in general to get a visa, and I feel like now, it's 10 times harder to even consider trying to get a visa,\" she said.",
      "Mick, who eventually obtained citizenship, said he would support amnesty for people without criminal convictions who are living illegally in the U.S. and contribute to communities.",
      "\"A lot of the people who are coming to our countries and our shores are coming here because of policies that we've allowed to happen and that have benefited us for decades,\" he said. \"I feel like we should be looking after people who need help the most.

    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Sarah al-Awady says she was sitting with her family early on the morning of Oct. 22, 2024, in their tent in Al-Zawaida, the town in the central Gaza Strip\n where the displaced Palestinians had taken shelter, when she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone.",
      "\"Suddenly I felt pain in my head, like I had been hit with an iron bar or something,\" the 18-year-old Gazan told CBS News this week. \"My family started screaming, 'a bullet, a bullet!' Everyone was panicking and they carried me and rushed me to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.\"",
      "CBS News has asked the Israel Defense Forces about its reported use of small-arms-equipped drones in Gaza, and about al-Awady's claim, specifically, that she was hit by one of the weapons in a camp for displaced civilians. In a statement sent Wednesday, the IDF said it \"follows international law, targeting only military objectives and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\"",
      "The military said it could not give details about the various aircraft it uses, \"as they are classified for security reasons, and to avoid compromising the operational capabilities of the IDF,\" and added that it could not provide information about al-Awady's claim without more precise information on the time and location of the shooting.",
      "The doctors did what they could with what little they had amid the devastation in Gaza\n, just over a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack sparked the war in the Palestinian territory. They could see that the bullet was lodged in al-Awady's skull, behind her right eye, but they didn't have the capacity to remove it.",
      "Al-Awady was eventually told there was nothing more the doctors in Gaza could do, but she refused to give up hope and insisted on staying in the hospital. At the very least, she thought, inside the hospital her badly wounded eye would be protected from the dusty conditions in her family's makeshift home.",
      "So she remained, relying on painkillers to cope with the excruciating pain in her head, but without any plan for relief in sight.",
      "In early November, al-Awady was seen by a team of volunteer medics visiting the European Hospital near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Dr. Mohamed Tawfik, an Egyptian, was among the volunteers, and when he saw al-Awady, he thought of someone he believed could help.",
      "Tawfik called his father, a veteran ophthalmologist, to get his medical opinion.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Tawfik, the elder doctor, told CBS News he wanted to go to Gaza to try to help the young woman, but the southern Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt was closed.",
      "\"I followed this case almost daily. I felt this was my case,\" Tawfik said.",
      "But he could not find a way to travel to Gaza and, at the time, with the war still raging, Israel was permitting very few people to leave the enclave, even for medical treatment.",
      "The doctor's son returned to Egypt, and al-Awady told CBS News she started giving up hope. For months she said she lived in fear that she would permanently lose sight in her right eye.",
      "\"I applied for treatment abroad, like many others. When people asked me, 'How long have you been waiting?' I'd say a month. They'd tell me, 'Forget it, we've been waiting for so much longer.'\"",
      "A glimmer of hope would finally come, about three months after the bullet lodged in al-Awady's head, with the news that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire\n deal. It came into effect on Jan. 19, 2024, and al-Awady was able to return to her home in the decimated north of Gaza.",
      "She said she was relieved to find her family's home among the few buildings spared from the destruction. She stayed there for a week, until, on the evening of February 8, she received a call from the World Health Organization, telling her she would be leaving the following day for Egypt.",
      "\"There is no electricity, so I literally packed my luggage by candlelight,\" she recalled. Only her mother was permitted to travel with her, but the pair reached Egypt the next day, as planned.",
      "She was sent first to the city of Port Said, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. A week later, Dr. Tawfik managed to get her moved to the hospital where he works in Al-Sharqia Governorate, in the Nile Delta.",
      "Three teams \u2014 ophthalmology, neurosurgery and radiology \u2014 worked together, debating the best approach to remove the bullet that had been lodged for months right next to al-Awady's optic nerve.",
      "\"We ran several simulations to find the best route to avoid the optic nerve,\" Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky, of the Al Nour Radiology Center, told CBS News. He helped guide the surgery remotely via a video link from his workstation at the separate facility.",
      "\"The bullet landed in the best possible place for the patient, but the worst place for a medical team,\" Shawky told CBS News. \"Had it moved a millimeter in any direction, it would have caused great damage.\"",
      "The doctors agreed the best option was to try to reach the bullet by entering through al-Awady's eye socket, to avoid damaging her brain.",
      "Tawfik was direct, telling al-Awady there was a 50% chance of success, a risk of internal bleeding, and she could lose her eye entirely or have her vision severely impaired.",
      "\"I cried. I was very scared, but I prayed and accepted the risk,\" she told CBS News.",
      "\"His amazing medical team tried their best to improve my spirit, to make me psychologically ready, and they did. I entered the operating room laughing and full of joy,\" al-Awady said",
      "The surgery was carried out last week, and it was a success. Tawfik told CBS News he was surprised by the amount of infection and abscess caused by the bullet, which had rusted over time inside al-Awady's head.",
      "Even with the bullet out, al-Awady is not fully out of the woods.",
      "\"Three hours later, I opened my eyes and they told me that, thanks to God, all went well,\" she recalled. \"I started crying again.\"",
      "\"She is very stable now, and she is taking her meds and getting better,\" Tawfik told CBS News. \"My goal was first to end the pain caused by the infection and, second, to preserve her current eyesight level. I am hoping that after we deal with the retinal detachment her sight will improve.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration appears to be back in Ukraine's corner, but it's unclear if Putin, while enjoying battlefield victories, can be convinced to halt his assault.",
    "story": [
      "It's a confusing time for American diplomacy. After yesterday's meeting in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. appeared on Tuesday to be back in Ukraine's corner \u2014 and calling on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire\n in the war it started more than three years ago. It remained entirely unclear on Wednesday, however, whether Vladimir Putin might agree to a temporary ceasefire. His forces currently have the momentum on the battlefield\n but, like Ukraine, Russia is thought to have suffered hundreds of thousands of military casualties.",
      "\"We're going to tell (the Russians) this is what's on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them to say yes or no,\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the meeting in Jeddah. \"If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here\u2026 The ball's now in their court.\"",
      "Russia hedges, but notes battlefield \"dynamics are good\" for Putin",
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday that it needed more details on the proposal and time to consider it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow assumed that Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation at the talks with Ukraine on Tuesday, would be briefing Russian counterparts \"on the details of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia,\" but that before such information was shared, \"Russia does not want to get ahead of itself on the issue of the proposed truce.\"",
      "\"Contacts are planned in the coming days,\" Peskov said.",
      "Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, is expected to head to Russia for talks later this week. Peskov indicated those talks could lead to another telephone conversation between Putin and Mr. Trump. He said there were no concrete plans for such a conversation yet, but \"if necessary, [it] can be organized very quickly.\"",
      "The Kremlin spokesman hinted, however, that Russia's bargaining position in any looming ceasefire talks was only getting stronger with every passing day. Putin's forces have continued a slow but steady advance in recent weeks, retaking ground in Russia\n's western border region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces staged a shock incursion last year.",
      "\"The Kremlin is closely monitoring information from the military in the Kursk region,\" Peskov said. \"The data shows that Russian forces are advancing successfully, the dynamics are good.\"",
      "Russia's military said Wednesday that forces had retaken five more small villages in Kursk from Ukrainian troops. Russia also unleashed a fresh rocket attack on Ukraine overnight, with the State Emergency Service reporting strikes on Zelenskyy's heavily bombarded hometown of Kryvyi Rih. The service said apartment buildings, administrative buildings, a shop, an educational institution, buses and other vehicles were damaged in the strikes, and it accused Russia of then shelling rescuers who had responded. Local media reports said at least nine people were wounded and one woman, a passerby, was killed.",
      "The White House's shifting Ukraine policy",
      "The White House's shift after the meeting in Saudi Arabia \u2014 clearly putting the onus back on Moscow to end the war that Putin launched more than three years ago \u2014 was the second dramatic turn\n by the Trump administration in less than a month as it steers America's policy on Ukraine. It stood in stark contrast to the meeting Zelenskyy had just weeks ago in Washington, when Mr. Trump called the elected Ukrainian president \"a dictator,\" said he didn't \"have the cards right now\" to negotiate the terms of a truce, and then publicly berated him in the Oval Office.",
      "Mr. Trump then ordered the suspension of U.S. security assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine \u2014 both of which are crucial to the country standing any chance of holding Russia's advancing forces at bay.",
      "The pause was lifted Tuesday upon news of the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on a framework for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately unblocking a consignment of weapons already promised to Kyiv \u2014 roughly $3.8 billion worth of air defense systems, HIMARS rockets, artillery and support for Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.",
      "In Poland, a U.S. NATO ally that shares a long border with western Ukraine and has staunchly supported Zelenskyy throughout the war, Prime Minister Donald Tusk lauded the \"important step towards peace,\" as the country's defense ministry confirmed the transfer of U.S.-supplied weapons had resumed across the Polish border.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, both of whom have indicated a willingness to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine as part of any eventual truce deal, both hailed the progress in Jeddah, with Starmer calling it a \"remarkable breakthrough,\" while Macron cautioned that Kyiv would still need \"robust\" security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, to ward off any future Russian aggression.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters Wednesday, appeared to add further nuance to the White House's stance on the position of Ukraine and its neighbors, saying European nations would \"have to be involved\" in reaching a ceasefire, and framing the ongoing discussions as being \"about deterrence for Ukraine against future aggression.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and other senior U.S. officials have for weeks played down the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and completely ruled out any suggestion of U.S. boots on the ground. They have insisted that a new economic deal between Kyiv and Washington, aimed at granting U.S. access to Ukraine's reserves of highly-sought after mineral resources\n, would bring American investment that would effectively deter Russia, without a clear U.S. military commitment.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday, according to the Reuters news agency, that he would not frame a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal as a deterrent to Russia.",
      "\"There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground that prevents another war from starting in the future,\" Rubio said, stressing that the Trump administration wasn't approaching the concept of security guarantees \"with any sort of preconceived notion.\"",
      "\"The bottom line,\" he said, \"is it needs to be something that makes Ukraine feel as if they can deter and prevent a future invasion.\"",
      "During the first three years of war, the U.S. government committed well over $100 billion to support Ukraine, helping defend a young democracy against Russia's aggression.",
      "That cause has drawn many volunteers from around the world to help train and fight alongside Ukraine's forces, including Americans who've come as private citizens, risking their own personal safety. CBS News has met Americans helping train Ukrainian soldiers and evacuating civilians from front-line areas.",
      "It's believed that hundreds of American volunteers, many of them U.S. veterans, have signed up to serve with Ukraine's army. For some of them, the U.S. administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2014 particularly remarks by Mr. Trump that echoed Kremlin talking points, suggesting the war is Kyiv's fault and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader \u2014 have not sat well.",
      "One American fighting for Ukraine's survival posted a video on social media after that explosive meeting at the White House, describing it in no uncertain terms as \"basically Russian propaganda out of the mouth of an American president.\"",
      "\"It's shameful,\" said the man, who identified himself in the video as \"Nasty,\" an American volunteer fighting with a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Kharkiv region. \"I voted for that man two times. I've always been a diehard Trump supporter, to the point of losing friends over standing up for that man and what he says on TV. But last night he crossed a line.\"",

One sailor was presumed dead in the collision.",
      "Humberside Police said the 59-year-old was detained \"on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.\" He wasn't named by the police and has not been charged.",
      "Shipping company Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged container carrier the Solong, said the arrested man was the ship's master, whom the firm identified on Wednesday as a Russian national. It said he \"and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations.\"",
      "The company said the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.",
      "U.K. authorities have said they don't suspect foul play in the collision.",
      "An American crew member of the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker who anonymously spoke to CBS News because he wasn't permitted to speak with media about the crash said the vessel had been anchored on the spot where the collision occurred. The tanker had relayed its coordinates, the man said, meaning all other vessels in the area should have known its position.",
      "The crew member said the Solong\u00a0\"came out of the blue\"\n\u00a0and struck the Stena.",
      "He said he was near to the part of the Stena where the Solong made its impact, and that he had only seconds to react when he heard shouts to brace before impact.",
      "The government said the cause of the collision was being investigated. There was no indication of foul play, but it sparked fears of significant environmental damage.",
      "U.K. officials were watching for damage to birds and sea life after jet fuel poured into the North Sea when the Solong broadsided the Stena Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for more than 24 hours.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the Stena was carrying cargo in support of the Defense Department. The collision did not impact operations or combat readiness, the official said.",
      "Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to largely be out on the Stena, which had a large gash on its port side.",
      "The U.K. coast guard agency said Tuesday that the Solong was still alight. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and an approximately half-mile exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships.",
      "\"No sign of pollution from vessels is observed at this time,\" British Transport Minister Mike Kane told lawmakers in the House of Commons.",
      "The government said air quality readings were normal and the risk to public health onshore was \"very low.\"",
      "Kane initially said the Solong was expected to sink, but the government said later that both vessels were likely to stay afloat.",
      "The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.",
      "All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (north of London, with no major injuries. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards called off the search late Monday.",

Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured.",
      "The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.",
      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals\n, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",

      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.",

      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\n\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\n\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting\n between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",

      "Initial reports indicated that containers carrying sodium cyanide were on board the other ship, a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship called the MV Solong. Sodium cyanide is a toxic substance that evaporates quickly and could have created dangerous air conditions on the surface of the water for cleanup crews and animals.",

      "ARHGEF1 was \"switched on\" when T cells were exposed to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a chemical produced by platelets that helps with blood clotting.",
      "Taking a common over-the-counter pain reliever could help keep certain cancers from spreading, a new study suggests. (iStock)",
      "Too much of TXA2 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.",
      "That\u2019s where aspirin comes in \u2014 it is already known to stop the production of TXA2 and prevent clotting, which is why it may be recommended to prevent cardiac events in some people.",
      "\"Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies.\"",
      "\"This new research found that aspirin prevents cancers from spreading by decreasing TXA2 and releasing T cells from suppression,\" the press release stated.",

      "DAILY ASPIRIN AFTER A HEART ATTACK CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS, STUDY FINDS",

      "\"Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin,\" he went on.",
      "\"Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies, and therefore more accessible globally.\"",
      "Aspirin could reduce cancer metastatis (spread) by stimulating participants\u2019 immune systems, the research found. (iStock)",
      "Previous studies have suggested that daily aspirin treatment is associated with reduced cancer spread in humans with the disease and with reduced cancer mortality in patients without metastasis, noted senior researcher Dr. Rahul Roychoudhuri, professor of cancer immunology at the University of Cambridge.",
      "In one randomized controlled trial, taking 600 milligrams of aspirin daily for an average of 25 months substantially reduced cancer incidence in carriers of hereditary colorectal cancer.",
      "COMMON CANCER TREATMENT CAN HAVE THIS PAINFUL SIDE EFFECT",
      "Pashtoon Kasi, M.D., medical director of gastrointestinal medical oncology at City of Hope Orange County in California, reiterated that previous research has linked aspirin use with a reduced risk of cancer, particularly gastrointestinal tract cancers.",
      "\"It has been identified in numerous studies with mixed results on reducing the risk of recurrence and/or improving outcomes in patients with metastatic cancer,\" Kasi, who was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"This new study further demonstrates how aspirin and other inhibitors of this pathway could be used in new treatments to prevent the cancer from metastasizing or spreading.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "Roychoudhuri, the senior researcher, encouraged caution in applying the findings.",
      "While aspirin is low-cost and widely available, its long-term use is not without \"significant risks,\" he said, including stomach bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in older individuals.",
      "While aspirin is low-cost and widely available, its long-term use is not without \"significant risks,\" the researcher cautioned. (iStock)",
      "\"This is why we emphasize that patients should not start taking aspirin for cancer prevention without specific medical advice from their doctor,\" he said in a statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The risk-benefit calculation varies substantially between individuals based on age, comorbidities and concurrent medications,\" the doctor noted.",

      "Experts agree that patients should talk to their doctor to discuss the benefits and health risks associated with regular aspirin use.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "Next steps",
      "The scientists are planning to conduct more research \u2014 through the Add-Aspirin clinical trial, which will recruit more than 10,000 patients with early-stage breast, colorectal, gastroesophageal and prostate cancers across the U.K. and India \u2014 to determine whether aspirin can stop or delay the recurrence of these cancers.",
      "\"Patients interested in aspirin therapy should discuss it with their oncologist or family practitioner, who can evaluate the potential benefits against the risks.\"",
      "\"Our research suggests aspirin could potentially be most beneficial for patients with early-stage cancers who have been treated with curative intent but might harbor undetected micrometastases,\" Roychoudhuri said.",

      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"I couldn't take a shower for more than 30 seconds without being on oxygen,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.",

      "Thomas\u2019 story was remarkable in that he survived the first bout with COVID, but two years later, his lungs had deteriorated so badly from the scarring that he needed a double lung transplant, Scheinin shared.",
      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",

      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",

      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",

      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Clone Robotics, a Polish-American company, has recently unveiled its groundbreaking humanoid robot, Protoclone, sparking both fascination and unease across the internet. This eerily lifelike android represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics, closely replicating human anatomy and movement in ways never before seen.",
      "With its unsettlingly realistic movements, Protoclone is pushing the boundaries of what we expect from robots, raising both intrigue and questions about the future of robotics.",

      "The anatomy of this robot",
      "Protoclone stands at an impressive 6 feet tall and boasts a skeleton made of 206 polymer bones, mirroring the human skeletal structure. What truly sets this robot apart is its muscular system, featuring over 1,000 artificial muscles powered by\u00a0Clone Robotics' proprietary \"Myofiber\" technology.",

      "The muscle behind the machine",
      "The Myofiber system is a revolutionary approach to robotic movement. Each artificial muscle consists of a mesh tube containing an air-filled balloon. When hydraulic fluid is pumped into the balloon, it expands, causing the mesh to contract, much like a human muscle. This system is powered by a 500-watt electric pump, Protoclone's mechanical \"heart,\" capable of circulating fluid at a rate of 40 liters per minute.",

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",
      "Too good to be true offers: Be skeptical of messages promising large returns or unexpected windfalls.",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention. Your vigilance not only protected you but also helps educate others. Together, we can stay one step ahead of scammers and protect our finances.",

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",

      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",
      "Verify the developer \u2013 Always check the extension's publisher in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Official brands like Norton, Google or Microsoft will be clearly listed.",
      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

      "Here are 6 ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy:",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Eliana Birman, a Jewish student at Barnard, co-wrote a letter with fellow Barnard student Shoshana Aufzien demanding accountability from the college. The open letter has gotten nearly 1,300 signatures in a matter of days.",
      "Birman told Fox News Digital that the letter was meant as a direct response to an email from the Barnard Student Government Association (SGA) condemning the college for calling police to intervene in the unrest.",
      "\"My friends and I, especially Shoshana and I, were very frustrated with it because we didn't think that the email from the Barnard student government really represented us, because we honestly felt safer having police on our campus when there was a bomb threat and when we were in an emergency situation,\" Birman told Fox News Digital. \"And we don't think that having the police promise to never come on to campus is for the betterment of the safety of our community.\"",

      "The SGA also listed three demands in the letter: first, \"amnesty for all students connected to the Milstein Library sit-in\"; second, \"a good-faith negotiation\" with senior staff, SGA and student protesters; and third, the restructuring of Barnard\u2019s disciplinary process to one that involves students as well as faculty.",
      "Anti-Israel activity at Columbia University reached a fever pitch last spring with an infamous encampment on the campus quad. Birman believes that messaging is still having an impact on student agitators. Barnard is an official college of Columbia University, and the institutions have a long-standing relationship.",

      "Birman told Fox News Digital that, despite the anti-Israel agitators\u2019 demonstrations on campus, she generally felt physically safe until the bomb threat.",
      "\"Most of the time, I feel completely safe just walking around the campus with my dog tag, my Star of David, all those things.

They're acknowledging that it's a form of hate, and they're acknowledging that it's intimidation and that it's creating a sense of unrest on campus.

      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",

      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

      "\"Both sides need to come to an understanding,\" he said. \"The Russians can't conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it will be very difficult for Ukraine, in any reasonable time period, to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014. So the only solution to this war is diplomacy and getting them to a table where that's possible.",
      "\"Then we'll have to determine how far they are from the Russian position, which we don't know yet either. And then once you understand where both sides truly are, it gives you a sense of how big the divide is and how hard it's going to be,\" Rubio explained. \"I'm hoping it'll be a positive interaction along those lines.\"",

Within days, cautious technical language gave way to media headlines and political statements claiming mass starvation was already underway,\" professor Troen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"One of the most persistent falsehoods has been the claim that before the war, 500 or more humanitarian trucks entered Gaza daily, and that this number was necessary to meet the population\u2019s needs. In reality, the number of food trucks was around or fewer than 100 per day before the war, and has since increased substantially,\" he continued. \"Our study aimed to address that gap by analyzing verified food shipments. The numbers show that while there were variations, at no point did the food supply drop to starvation levels.\"",

      "When asked specifically about testimonies obtained by Fox News Digital from Gazans who reported struggling to find food on certain days, Endevelt acknowledged the study did not track final distribution within Gaza. \"We can\u2019t say there was no hunger, but we can confirm enough food entered,\" she said. \"Most of the time, in most months, there was enough food available.\"",
      "A key finding of the study is the distinction between food supply and distribution. \"Hamas systematically weaponized food distribution, using it as a tool of control,\" said Endevelt. \"Aid often didn\u2019t reach those in need because Hamas seized supplies, sold them on the black market, or prioritized its own fighters. Reports of famine are not due to a lack of aid but Hamas\u2019 deliberate strategy of restricting access to maintain power and profit.\"",
      "Despite these findings, the ICC investigation and global criticism continued. \"IPC reports, widely cited as evidence against Israel, failed to mention Hamas\u2019 role in manipulating aid,\" Troen said.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital whether the new findings would be considered in its investigation, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor responded: \"The ICC Office of the Prosecutor has a current and ongoing investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine. The Office\u2019s investigations are built from a wide range of sources. They can encompass Article 15 communications, information from states, international partners, and civil society, publicly available sources of information, and the direct collection of evidence by the Office, including interviews with witnesses.",

However, the political climate made the review process unusually intense.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most rigorously reviewed studies I\u2019ve ever worked on,\" Endevelt added. \"We had five reviewers, far more than usual, and months of back-and-forth revisions to ensure absolute accuracy.\"",

      "Polls have also shown that Carney is the frontrunner to become the next Liberal leader. Should he hold that job and automatically become Canadian prime minister as Trudeau\u2019s successor, he would help boost his party\u2019s fortunes at the ballot box.",

During his leadership run, the former central bank governor said he would replace it with an incentive program that rewards Canadians for \"making greener choices,\" such as purchasing an energy-efficient appliance.",
      "In a Jan. 26 open letter to Carney, Poilievre asked him whether he would be \"any different than the man you are trying to replace\" and commit to \"banning any prior Trudeau minister from serving in your Cabinet\" or \"pursue the same Trudeau agenda?\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 23:16:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday outlined plans for an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations.",
    "story": [
      "Promising to drive \u201ca dagger through the heart of climate-change religion,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday outlined plans for an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations.",
      "In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and an EPA news release, Zeldin announced that he intends to reconsider more than a dozen core EPA rules and regulations, including those pertaining to emissions standards for vehicles, pollution from power plants and the finding that provides the scientific basis for addressing climate change.",
      "\u201cToday marks the death of the Green New Scam,\u201d Zeldin wrote in The Wall Street Journal, arguing that his deregulation plan would create an environment where \u201cbusinesses can thrive and infrastructure can be built.\u201d He added that he wants to reassess rules that, in his view, \u201cthrottled oil and gas production and unfairly targeted coal-fired power plants,\u201d and suggested that his proposed actions would roll back \u201ctrillions of dollars in regulatory costs.\u201d",
      "The EPA announced that it will revisit water pollution limits for coal plants, air quality standards for small particles and the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters like oil and gas companies, among other rules.",
      "Zeldin also signaled that the EPA would consider upending its own endangerment finding, a 2009 legal decision that says greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the Earth and that warming presents a threat to public health and welfare. The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.",
      "\u201cThe endangerment finding is the one ring that rules them all, at least on the climate protection measures,\u201d said David Doniger, the senior strategist and attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s climate and energy department, referencing the Lord of the Rings series. \u201cAll of the climate protection rules, the rules to cut greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, power plants, from the oil and gas industry \u2014 all those rules are grounded in the finding.\u201d",
      "The EPA news release called it \u201cthe most momentous day\u201d in the agency\u2019s history.",
      "Environmental advocates said the deregulation effort is unparalleled in the EPA\u2019s 54-year history.",
      "\u201cThis is crazy. This is insane,\u201d said Jason Rylander, the legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Climate Law Institute, during a phone interview as he read, for the first time in full, the list of regulations the EPA said it may roll back. \u201cThere have been attempts to limit the authority of EPA, but the scale and scope and speed with which this administration is attacking environmental safeguards is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "The agency\u2019s announcement promises to spark legal battles with environmental groups that have vowed to fight the rollbacks. But first, the agency has to initiate a rulemaking process that will take months, if not longer, to complete.",
      "Environmental advocates said the work involved in overturning this many regulations would be monumental.",
      "\u201cThese are all rules and regulations. They can\u2019t just wish them away with a press release. You have to tear a regulation down the same way it was built up. They have to make a proposal for each one of these things and explain reasoning and show evidence, and they have to have public comment and respond to public comment and then reach a final decision and defend it in court,\u201d Doniger said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight them every step of the way.\u201d",
      "He added that any efforts to overturn the endangerment finding would be particularly difficult for the EPA in court.",
      "\u201cThat is going to be an impossible task for them,\u201d Doniger said, describing a \u201cDenali-size\u201d mountain of evidence showing that greenhouse gas pollution is fueling climate change and intensifying harms like wildfires, flooding and heat waves.",
      "In a news release, Zeldin said the agency would \u201cfollow the science, the law, and common sense wherever it leads\u201d as the agency reconsiders the legal basis for EPA\u2019s climate regulations.",
      "Some agency staffers said they were dismayed by Zeldin\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cSimply put, this is embarrassing,\u201d one EPA worker said, on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThis is not the EPA we have dedicated our careers to. Instead of highlighting the importance of protecting human health and the environment, this administration is highlighting cutting cost in dollar figures while ignoring the human cost. The air we breathe and water we drink is a collective human right and more valuable than any dollar figure.\u201d",
      "In his opinion piece, Zeldin seemed to anticipate such criticism.",
      "\u201cCritics may claim that these changes signal a retreat from environmental protection. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, the EPA\u2019s core mission remains safeguarding human health and the environment. The difference lies in how we achieve these goals\u2014through partnership rather than prescriptive bureaucracy, through collaboration rather than regulation.\u201d",
      "The EPA also announced on Wednesday that it would end its environmental justice programs, according to a news release. Zeldin ordered the reorganization and elimination of the Office of Environmental Justice and Environmental Justice divisions in its 10 regions, according to an agency memo reviewed by NBC News. The agency previously put about 170 environmental justice staffers on leave."

      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities.

      "The Afghan students were pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in Oman under the Women\u2019s Scholarship Endowment, one of numerous programs eliminated in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to drastically scale back USAID.",

      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to avoid is their return to Afghanistan, which would functionally amount to a death sentence for these women who have been aided by the United States in pursuing higher education opportunities,\u201d Le said.",
      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said the elimination of the scholarship program was \u201cshameful\u201d and called on the Trump administration to reverse course.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cIn this case, these bright young women with the world ahead of them could receive what could amount to a death sentence in a matter of days \u2014 simply because they were relying on a US-funded scholarship to get their education abroad.\u201d"

      "The tense one-hour debate in Milwaukee between liberal judge Susan Crawford and conservative judge Brad Schimel focused in large part on reproductive rights and the millions of dollars being spent on the race by high-profile billionaires and outside groups in what's technically a nonpartisan election scheduled for April 1.",
      "The contest will determine the court\u2019s ideological balance for the second time in two years \u2014 and possibly the future of several issues related to abortion rights, unions and congressional maps.",

      "Liberals have a 4-3 majority on the seven-person court after they won a 2023 election that flipped control to the left for the first time in 15 years. But liberal justice Ann Walsh Bradley's retirement has again put that control up for grabs.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "In their only debate before the election, the candidates took most of their shots at the other's backing from uber-wealthy mega-donors. Liberal billionaire George Soros and outside groups with ties to Elon Musk have already spent millions in a race that's on pace to become the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign in U.S. history.",
      "Crawford repeatedly criticized Schimel over the involvement of groups associated with Musk, the architect of the President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "In the most climactic line of the night, Crawford intentionally misnamed Schimel and claimed that her campaign had received numerous out-of-state donations because of people disliking Musk.",
      "\u201cI have support from all over the country \u2014 and it is because Elon Schimel is trying to buy this race, and people are very upset about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier, Schimel had been asked whether he embraced Musk\u2019s support of him on X. He replied that he was \u201clooking for the endorsement of the Wisconsin voters\u201d and that \u201coutside help that comes is not something I control.\u201d",
      "He also repeatedly slammed Crawford over the donations Soros had made to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, calling him a \u201cdangerous\u201d person to accept donations from.",
      "Soros gave $1 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party in January. Other liberal billionaires have donated, too, including Democratic Illinois Gov. JB\u00a0Pritzker and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.",
      "Wisconsin campaign finance laws allow the state parties to transfer cash to a candidate\u2019s committees, which both sides have done during this campaign.",

      "\u201cHe has basically taken over Brad Schimel\u2019s campaign,\u201d she said.",
      "A huge chunk of the GOP spending in the race has come from two Musk-aligned groups \u2014 Building America\u2019s Future and America PAC \u2014\u00a0that together have spent more than $8 million to boost Schimel. Building America\u2019s Future isn\u2019t required to disclose its donations, but Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Musk helped fund the group in the past. It has spent more than\u00a0$2.4 million on ads in the race so far, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",

      "The post came shortly after Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, filed a suit in Wisconsin challenging a state law banning carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "Crawford drew attention to that possibility Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cIt is no coincidence that Elon Musk started spending that money within days of Tesla filing a lawsuit in Wisconsin,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to buy access and influence by buying himself a justice.\u201d",
      "Both sides have spent heavily, painting the other's billionaire backers as monsters.",

      "Asked whether he\u2019d recuse himself in the Tesla case if it made it to the Supreme Court, Schimel replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, reproductive rights and the fate of the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban is the other hot topic of the race. Each candidate tried to paint the other as already having made up their mind on all cases related to abortion rights.",
      "The state Supreme Court heard a challenge to the ban in November and is widely expected to overturn the law \u2014 but there is still some pending litigation. While abortion providers in the state resumed the procedure in 2023 after a judge ruled that the 175-year-old law didn\u2019t apply to consensual medical abortions, the state Supreme Court is reviewing whether to entirely invalidate the law. There is also a separate case in which Planned Parenthood has directly asked the court to establish whether the state constitution established a right to an abortion.",
      "Both candidates represented groups and causes earlier in their careers that would seem to outline their positions on the issue.",

      "Schimel reiterated that the ban is \u201ca validly passed law\u201d but said he did \u201cnot believe that it reflects the will of the people of Wisconsin today.\u201d",
      "Crawford, who as an attorney earlier in her career represented Planned Parenthood, refused to take a position on the cases Wednesday, saying they remain \u201can open question that \u201cwill be decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d Still, she slammed the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The two at various other points jostled over other issues that are likely to appear before the court \u2014 including the fate of the landmark legislation signed by former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, that eliminated collective bargaining for most public workers, as well as cases challenging the state\u2019s congressional maps, which favor Republicans."

    "story": [
      "President Emmanuel Macron said in a prime-time address to France on Wednesday night that Europe must be prepared to go it alone in defending Ukraine, without further assistance from the United States under the Trump administration.",
      "\"I\u00a0want to believe that the U.S. will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,\" Macron said from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris.",
      "He continued, \"Whether we reach peace in Ukraine soon or not, we need to be able to recognize the Russian threat and better defend ourselves in order to deter such attacks. Whatever happens, we need to provide ourselves with more arms, more equipment in terms of defense, to provide a dissuasive force.\"",
      "Macron warned that Ukraine cannot be abandoned in its fight against Russia because, he said: \"Who can believe that in this context, Russia will stop at Ukraine? Russia has become, and will remain, a threat to France and Europe.\u201d",
      "The French president made clear that France and other European countries must take concrete steps, including investing in defense and military capabilities, to protect the security of their nations and Ukraine's.",
      "\u201cTo remain a spectator in this dangerous world would be crazy,\" Macron said. \"The initiatives for peace are going in the right direction, and I welcome them, and we need to continue to help Ukrainians resist until they can negotiate with Russia a solid and lasting peace for themselves and for all of us. The path to peace cannot be achieved by abandoning Ukraine.\"",
      "Macron reiterated remarks made by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the weekend at a defense summit in London that Europe may have to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "\"Our forces will be there if necessary to guarantee peace, not before a peace agreement is signed,\" Macron said Wednesday. \"We will continue to meet with allies to move toward the signing of such an agreement. It's a plan for a lasting, solid, verifiable peace agreement, which we're working on with European partners and Ukraine.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that he was grateful for Macron's \"clear vision and our joint efforts to achieve peace.\"",
      "\"Peace must be real, not just a word\u2014it cannot mean Ukraine\u2019s capitulation or collapse. It must be just, reliable, and lasting, and this can only be achieved through strong and long-term security guarantees \u2014 for Ukraine, Europe, and the entire world,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Macron and Starmer have teamed up in a desperate attempt to heal American-Ukraine ties after last Friday\u2019s extraordinary shouting match at the White House involving Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Both Starmer and Macron have sought to balance their yearslong outspoken support for Zelenskyy with the need to retain good relations with the United States.",
      "Teeing up his speech, Macron said on X that it came in a \u201cmoment of great uncertainty, when the world is facing its greatest challenges.\u201d Starmer told British lawmakers Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump three times since he visited the White House last week.",
      "This Anglo-French mission has at times appeared onerous.",
      "After the Oval Office spat, Trump continued to berate Zelenskyy on social media, with the president and some of his team suggesting that Ukraine\u2019s leader could or should be ousted from office. The administration then paused aid to Ukraine, a vital lifeline holding back the Kremlin war machine.",
      "The aid freeze is a serious blow not just to Ukraine, whose biggest military backer is the U.S., but also Europe, which is years away from being able to defend itself against Russia without Washington.",
      "Things shifted Tuesday when Trump said during his joint address to Congress that he had received \u201can important letter\u201d from Zelenskyy  stating the Ukrainian president's desire for peace and his gratitude for U.S. support.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed the thrust of this missive in an X post on Tuesday, calling the White House clash \u201cregrettable,\u201d thanking Trump\u2019s team and saying he was ready to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s rich mineral wealth.",
      "Still, there is much to resolve.",
      "Ukraine is reluctant to sign a ceasefire without \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d \u2014 meaning protection from Europe and the U.S. against Russia violating the truce, as it has done before.",
      "Supporters and independent analysts worry that a ceasefire would allow Russia to regroup \u2014 as well as showing Russian President Vladimir Putin that attacking a European country is not only permitted, but rewarded.",
      "Zelenskyy once stood firm in demanding these security guarantees. But now facing pressure from Moscow and Washington, he suggested on X that he would accept a minerals deal that was merely a looser \u201cstep toward\u201d such promises."

      "A Connecticut man alleged to have been held captive and starved by his stepmother for more than two decades escaped the small room he had been locked away in by setting their house on fire, authorities said Wednesday.",
      "When authorities responded to the blaze in Waterbury, southwest of Hartford, on Feb. 17, they found a severely emaciated 32-year-old man who had not received medical or dental care in years and had been subjected to \u201cprolonged abuse, starvation, severe neglect and inhumane treatment,\u201d the police department said in a news release.",
      "According to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant, authorities were dispatched to the family\u2019s home at 8:42 p.m. on a report of an active fire.",
      "The man, who was being treated for smoke inhalation, told a responding officer that he set the fire using a lighter, hand sanitizer and paper.",
      "\u201cI wanted my freedom,\u201d he said, according to the affidavit.",
      "His stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan, 56, was home at the time and refused to talk to police, Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said in an interview.",
      "Spagnolo said that in his 33 years in law enforcement, \"this is probably one of the worst acts of inhumanity I've ever witnessed.\"",
      "A relative who visited the stepson after he was freed compared his condition to that of a Holocaust survivor, Spagnolo recalled.",
      "\"I'm grateful the victim is on the mend,\" he said.",
      "Sullivan was arrested Wednesday and arraigned on charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful restraint and other crimes, according to the release. Her bond was set at $300,000.",
      "Sullivan denied the allegations through her attorney.",
      "\u201cHe was not locked in a room,\u201d the lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis, told NBC Connecticut. \u201cShe did not restrain him in any way. She provided food; she provided shelter. She is blown away by these allegations.\u201d",
      "At Sullivan\u2019s arraignment, prosecutors said the stepson, who is 5-feet-9, weighed 68 pounds when he was found and told authorities he had been locked inside an 8-by-9-foot room since the fourth grade, according to the station.",
      "The man, identified only as MV-1 in the affidavit, told authorities he was let out in the mornings for 15 minutes to two hours to do chores before he was locked away again.",
      "\"When asked how often this routine was he stated 'nearly everyday,'\" the warrant says.",
      "The man recalled that his father used to let him out of the room on weekends, according to the affidavit, and he'd occasionally be allowed to work in their yard.",
      "The last time he recalled leaving the property was nearly 20 years ago, when he was 14 or 15, according to the affidavit.",
      "After his father died, his captivity grew more intense, according to the affidavit: He was given two sandwiches a day and the equivalent of two small bottles of water.",
      "When a detective asked why he never told anyone about his situation, he said he wanted to but he feared \"the constant threat of longer lock downs and further diminishment of food,\" according to the affidavit.",
      "He \"describes a life of being mentally conditioned by Sullivan,\" the document says. \"He stated that the threat was that he would 'not see the light of day' if he told anyone and, knowing that he had little time out of his room to that point, it was not something he could risk.\"",
      "The stepson was in school until the fourth grade, Spagnolo said. An inquiry by state officials in 2005 found a home-schooling plan adequate, he said, and there was no contact with law enforcement or other officials in the intervening years.",
      "At one point an uncle grew concerned after he visited the family for Christmas and the stepson appeared skinny, meek and mild-mannered, Spagnolo said.",
      "When he tried to talk to the boy, Spagnolo said, Sullivan intervened.",
      "\"The family pushed him away,\" Spagnolo said. \"He'd ask questions, he tried to reach out over time, but he never received any response.\"",
      "He added: \"There was a lot of inaction by the people closest to the victim. That's really hard to judge. We all have families. We all understand how domestic situations work. It seems like this went on for quite a long time and Kimberly was very successful hiding this from the public eye and even her family's eyes.\""

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 23:34:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The Department of Education cut nearly half its civil rights investigators, which experts say could have a major impact on children with special needs.",
    "story": [
      "Massive layoffs initiated this week at the Education Department could hamstring the federal government\u2019s efforts to assist students with disabilities, former officials and education experts said, citing blows to the agency\u2019s civil rights and research divisions.",
      "On Tuesday, the department began laying off around 1,300 employees, cutting nearly half the staff in its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and\u00a0over 100 from the Institute of Education Sciences, according to information released by American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, the union for department staff members.",
      "The cuts in those two divisions mean there will be far fewer staff members to finish the 12,000 pending federal investigations into allegations of civil rights violations at schools \u2014 roughly half of which involve disability issues \u2014 and fewer employees to review and distribute government-funded research into effective ways to educate children with autism or severe intellectual disabilities.",
      "The layoffs are the first step toward dismantling the department, a goal espoused by President Donald Trump and his education secretary, Linda McMahon. Experts say they raise concerns about what the future will look like for civil rights enforcement as the Trump administration continues chipping away at federal oversight.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s hundreds of investigators who no longer work for OCR and whose expertise that OCR has benefited from over all these years that the nation is now losing,\u201d said Catherine Lhamon, who led the Office for Civil Rights during the Obama and Biden administrations.",
      "Brittany Coleman, a lawyer with the Office for Civil Rights based in Dallas who was laid off this week, said that with fewer staff members, students with disabilities fighting for accommodations for test-taking, for example, will have to wait longer for help from the department\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and it could arrive too late.",
      "\u201cWhat kind of harm does that mean for their grades, for their mental well-being, and how is that going to impact their educational outcomes, which are now not being tracked anymore?\u201d asked Coleman, who also was a shop steward, referring to layoffs at the Institute of Education Sciences. \u201cWhat is this is going to mean overall for our students who have disabilities as far as them growing up and achieving the same educational goals and dreams that we all have?\u201d",
      "Neither the Education Department nor the White House have responded to requests for comment. In an interview Tuesday on Fox News, McMahon said that the department will still do what it is required to by law and that funding for schools to support students with special needs will still be provided. Trump defended the layoffs Wednesday, insisting to reporters, without evidence, that many of the terminated staff members were not working or were doing poor jobs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the best people,\u201d he said.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights lost at least 243 union-eligible staff members, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, and an unknown number of supervisors. The office historically had around 600 attorneys handling complaints alleging discrimination based on race, gender, disability and sexual orientation, and most already had caseloads of 50 or more.\u00a0Schools can also call the Office for Civil Rights for technical assistance to prevent violating students\u2019 rights, but that help could also become less readily available.",
      "\u201cThe provision of education to students with disabilities is complex,\u201d said Denise Marshall, CEO of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which represents families of children with special needs in schools.\u00a0\u201cThey have to have an education with specialized instruction-related services, all the supports they need to learn and grow, and there has to be expert personnel to interpret and carry out the statute\u2019s requirements.\u201d",
      "More than 300 employees in the Federal Student Aid office were terminated, as well, according to the union, slashing more than a quarter of the division in charge of student loans and college tuition grants.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be, I think, a horrific impact for students trying to get information about opportunities to go to college or trade school or just take classes and find out whatever Pell grant money ... that they\u2019re eligible for,\u201d said a current department employee, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation.",
      "Conservatives have cheered the Trump administration\u2019s moves to disband the Education Department, frequently using the refrain that it is time to send education \u201cback to the states,\u201d which are already in charge of their schools\u2019 curricula.",
      "\u201cThere are 50 other departments of education in the United States of America,\u201d Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative activist group, said in an interview last week. \u201cEvery state has a department of education. There\u2019s absolutely no reason that we need the bureaucracy, the red tape, the cost.\u201d",
      "But Democratic governors vowed Wednesday to fight the layoffs\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the broader plans to possibly shut down the entire agency \u2014\u00a0while also signaling that they are scrambling to find ways to address funding and oversight shortfalls that could result from the cuts.",
      "\u201cThe states can\u2019t totally backfill everything, certainly on education,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat,\u00a0said on a phone call with reporters. He later added that\u00a0the need to accommodate children with disabilities and other populations expected to be most affected by a reshaped agency could eventually prompt tax increases.",
      "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said on the call that his office was already working with the state attorney general to fight the layoffs with a lawsuit and that \u201cat some point in time, we will be going to court again.\u201d",
      "As part of the layoffs announced Tuesday, all employees working out of the department\u2019s regional offices in San Francisco, New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Cleveland will be fired. That came as news to top officials in the governors\u2019 offices and education agencies in many of those cities\u2019 states.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the Illinois State Board of Education had still not received \u201cany formal communication\u201d or guidance from leadership at the Education Department about the layoffs, a spokesperson said.\u00a0Neither had Kentucky's education commissioner.",
      "In Montana, however, Susie Hedalen, a Republican who is the superintendent of public instruction, said her office had been receiving dispatches about the layoffs from department officials throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "The updates, Hedalen said, have aided her department\u2019s goal in \u201cpreparing to take a stronger role\u201d in running some of programs that McMahon and Trump have said they want to move to the states."

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence technology is becoming increasingly integral to everyday life, with an Elon University survey finding that 52% of U.S. adults have used AI large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Copilot.",
      "The survey, conducted in January by the Imagining the Digital Future Center at the university in North Carolina, found that 34% of its 500 respondents who had used AI said they use large language models (LLMs) at least once a day. Most popular was ChatGPT, with 72% of respondents reporting they have used it. Google\u2019s Gemini was second, at 50%.",
      "It has become increasingly common for people to find themselves developing personal relationships with AI chatbots. The survey found that 38% of users said they believe LLMs will \u201cform deep relationships with humans,\u201d and over half reported having had spoken conversations with chatbots. Around 9% of users said the main purpose they use the models for is \u201csocial kinds of encounters like casual conversation and companionship.\u201d The respondents found that the models can express a variety of personality traits, including confidence, curiosity and even senses of humor.",
      "\u201cThese findings start to establish a baseline for the way humans and AI systems will evolve together in the coming years,\u201d Lee Rainie, director of the Imagining the Digital Future Center, told NBC News in a statement. \u201cThese tools are increasingly being integrated into daily life in sometimes quite intimate ways at the level of emotion and impact. It\u2019s clearly shaping up as the story of another chapter in human history.\u201d",
      "That is consistent with an overall trend that found that 51% of respondents use LLMs for personal endeavors, rather than work-related activities.",
      "When it comes to using the models for work purposes, respondents reported that they have used them with work-related apps such as Slack, PowerPoint and Zoom. They have also used the models to do such things as write emails, research ideas and summarize documents. Over 50% of respondents said the models have helped them improve their productivity.",
      "Many respondents reported having\u00a0anxieties about the technology. Sixty-three percent thought the models could replace a significant amount of human-to-human communication, and 59% thought they could cause a significant number of job losses.",
      "AI technology is becoming more popular as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been pushing for increased investment in AI technology.",
      "In January, Trump announced a joint venture among OpenAI (the company that developed ChatGPT), Oracle and SoftBank. The executives of the AI companies committed to invest $100 billion in the initiative up front and up to $500 billion over the next four years. Trump also signed an executive order about AI a few days after he entered office.",
      "When it comes to politics, the survey found that Republican LLM users are more likely than Democrats to use the models to search for political news and information. Thirty-four percent of respondents reported using them to get news or political information.",
      "Vice President JD Vance has been particularly outspoken about bias in AI, telling world leaders at an AI summit in Paris that the \u201cTrump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d The survey found, however, that 49% of users believe the creators of the LLMs should be responsible for limiting bias in LLM answers rather than government officials and lawmakers.",
      "As schools have also been in limbo trying to find the best way to address the use of AI technology in classrooms, the survey found that 36% of respondents use the models for schoolwork or homework. The survey also found that 77% of LLM users are ages 18 to 29. Households with children under 18 were also more likely to use LLMs, compared with those without."

      "The number of former Indiana University basketball players who say team doctor Bradford Bomba Sr. sexually assaulted them has risen to four.",
      "And their lawsuit against their alma mater now includes an account from a fifth ex-IU basketball player who says he publicly complained to legendary coach Bobby Knight in 1979 about Bomba\u2019s giving him unnecessary rectal examinations.",
      "Knight, who led the Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000, told the unidentified player that he was required to have a physical and \u201ctook no action to address the player\u2019s repeated complaints to him\u201d about Bomba, the lawsuit says.",
      "Kathleen Delaney, who represents the former players, filed the amended complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on Monday, adding Larry Richardson Jr., a fourth former player, to the list of plaintiffs. The lawsuit also includes a fifth account from an unnamed former player who is not a plaintiff. According to the fifth player\u2019s account, he made a complaint to top officials in Indiana University\u2019s athletic department about Bomba years before the abuse alleged by the plaintiffs.",
      "IU spokesperson Mark Bode declined to comment on the latest allegations, including that Knight was told directly about allegations of abuse of players against Bomba 45 years ago at an Assembly Hall gathering. Bode instead pointed to a statement in September announcing that IU had hired a private law firm to conduct an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the allegations.",
      "\u201cWe ask for the IU Community to have patience as we search for the truth and to have confidence that the university\u2019s actions will be consistent with our values,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The fifth former played alleged in the lawsuit that the team trainer at the time, Bob Young, and former IU football player George Taliaferro, who worked in the university president\u2019s office at the time, were present when he reported the abuse to Knight.",
      "\u201cBomba is a piece of s---,\u201d Taliaferro is alleged to have told the gathering, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Knight, Taliaferro and Young are all deceased.",
      "Richardson, who is from Florida and played for the Hoosiers from 1995 to 2000, joined the class action lawsuit against the Indiana University Trustees and longtime men\u2019s basketball trainer Tim Garl, which was originally filed in October with two plaintiffs, bringing the total to four accusers.",
      "In the amended lawsuit, Richard, like the other accusers \u2014 John Flowers, Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller \u2014 alleges that he was subjected to \u201csystemic sexual assaults and sex-based harassment under the guise of medical care\u201d by Bomba and that IU did nothing to protect them from a predator.",
      "\u201cWhen I enrolled in Indiana University, I was the first person in my family to go to college. At that age, I was used to doing what I was told to do. It disappoints me that people in authority at IU abused the trust I had in them,\u201d Richardson said in a statement through his lawyer.",
      "Richardson, who went on to play professional basketball in China, Argentina, Spain and Mexico, was 19 when Carl sent him to Bomba for a physical, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cOh boy, get ready\u201d one of Richardson\u2019s teammates told him, without revealing that he was about to be subjected to an unnecessary prostate exam, the lawsuit says.",
      "Richardson\u2019s allegations echo those of Mujezinovic and Miller, who played for the Hoosiers in the 1990s, and Flowers, who was on the team from 1981 to 1982, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Flowers, Mujezinovic, Miller and Richardson are suing the IU trustees and Garl under Title IX, a federal law that requires all colleges and universities that receive federal funds to put safeguards in place to protect students from sexual predators.",
      "All are seeking unspecified damages and have urged former teammates to come forward and join their lawsuit.",
      "Bomba, 88, is not listed as a defendant. In December, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination dozens of times during a deposition when he was asked whether he performed rectal examinations on young athletes.",
      "He agreed that he and Knight were \u201cclose friends,\u201d but he invoked the Fifth again when he was asked whether Knight told him to perform \u201cdigital rectal exams on his players.\u201d",

    "summary": "Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday outlined plans for an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations.",
    "story": [
      "Promising to drive \u201ca dagger through the heart of climate-change religion,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday outlined plans for an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations.",
      "In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and an EPA news release, Zeldin announced that he intends to reconsider more than a dozen core EPA rules and regulations, including those pertaining to emissions standards for vehicles, pollution from power plants and the finding that provides the scientific basis for addressing climate change.",
      "\u201cToday marks the death of the Green New Scam,\u201d Zeldin wrote in The Wall Street Journal, arguing that his deregulation plan would create an environment where \u201cbusinesses can thrive and infrastructure can be built.\u201d He added that he wants to reassess rules that, in his view, \u201cthrottled oil and gas production and unfairly targeted coal-fired power plants,\u201d and suggested that his proposed actions would roll back \u201ctrillions of dollars in regulatory costs.\u201d",
      "The EPA announced that it will revisit water pollution limits for coal plants, air quality standards for small particles and the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by large emitters like oil and gas companies, among other rules.",
      "Zeldin also signaled that the EPA would consider upending its own endangerment finding, a 2009 legal decision that says greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the Earth and that warming presents a threat to public health and welfare. The finding is the lynchpin for the agency\u2019s regulations about greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.",
      "\u201cThe endangerment finding is the one ring that rules them all, at least on the climate protection measures,\u201d said David Doniger, the senior strategist and attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s climate and energy department, referencing the Lord of the Rings series. \u201cAll of the climate protection rules, the rules to cut greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, power plants, from the oil and gas industry \u2014 all those rules are grounded in the finding.\u201d",
      "The EPA news release called it \u201cthe most momentous day\u201d in the agency\u2019s history.",
      "Environmental advocates said the deregulation effort is unparalleled in the EPA\u2019s 54-year history.",
      "\u201cThis is crazy. This is insane,\u201d said Jason Rylander, the legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Climate Law Institute, during a phone interview as he read, for the first time in full, the list of regulations the EPA said it may roll back. \u201cThere have been attempts to limit the authority of EPA, but the scale and scope and speed with which this administration is attacking environmental safeguards is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "The agency\u2019s announcement promises to spark legal battles with environmental groups that have vowed to fight the rollbacks. But first, the agency has to initiate a rulemaking process that will take months, if not longer, to complete.",
      "Environmental advocates said the work involved in overturning this many regulations would be monumental.",
      "\u201cThese are all rules and regulations. They can\u2019t just wish them away with a press release. You have to tear a regulation down the same way it was built up. They have to make a proposal for each one of these things and explain reasoning and show evidence, and they have to have public comment and respond to public comment and then reach a final decision and defend it in court,\u201d Doniger said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight them every step of the way.\u201d",
      "He added that any efforts to overturn the endangerment finding would be particularly difficult for the EPA in court.",
      "\u201cThat is going to be an impossible task for them,\u201d Doniger said, describing a \u201cDenali-size\u201d mountain of evidence showing that greenhouse gas pollution is fueling climate change and intensifying harms like wildfires, flooding and heat waves.",
      "In a news release, Zeldin said the agency would \u201cfollow the science, the law, and common sense wherever it leads\u201d as the agency reconsiders the legal basis for EPA\u2019s climate regulations.",
      "Some agency staffers said they were dismayed by Zeldin\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cSimply put, this is embarrassing,\u201d one EPA worker said, on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThis is not the EPA we have dedicated our careers to. Instead of highlighting the importance of protecting human health and the environment, this administration is highlighting cutting cost in dollar figures while ignoring the human cost. The air we breathe and water we drink is a collective human right and more valuable than any dollar figure.\u201d",
      "In his opinion piece, Zeldin seemed to anticipate such criticism.",
      "\u201cCritics may claim that these changes signal a retreat from environmental protection. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, the EPA\u2019s core mission remains safeguarding human health and the environment. The difference lies in how we achieve these goals\u2014through partnership rather than prescriptive bureaucracy, through collaboration rather than regulation.\u201d",
      "The EPA also announced on Wednesday that it would end its environmental justice programs, according to a news release. Zeldin ordered the reorganization and elimination of the Office of Environmental Justice and Environmental Justice divisions in its 10 regions, according to an agency memo reviewed by NBC News. The agency previously put about 170 environmental justice staffers on leave."

      "DENVER \u2014 A woman who was part of a group charged with setting a cross on fire in front of a defaced campaign sign for a candidate who became Colorado Springs\u2019\u00a0first Black mayor\u00a0pleaded guilty on Tuesday in what authorities say was a hoax.",
      "Deanna West, one of three people indicted in the 2023 incident, pleaded guilty in Denver federal court to one count of being part of a conspiracy to set the fire and then spread false information about it in the run-up to the election of Mayor Yemi Mobolade.",
      "In exchange, prosecutors said they would drop an additional charge related to setting the fire.",
      "Prosecutors say that after staging the cross burning, a photo and video of it were sent to media and civic organizations making it seem like an attack on Mobolade.",
      "According to the plea agreement, the conspiracy\u2019s goal was to interfere in the campaign of Mobolade\u2019s opponent and create the belief that Mobolade was being discouraged from running because of his race. West was dependent on one of the other three people charged, Derrick Bernard, for employment and housing and agreed to participate to curry favor with him, the document said.",
      "Lawyers for Bernard and the third person charged, Ashley Blackcloud, said in court filings that the government\u2019s evidence shows they were trying to help Mobolade win by generating outrage. They argued that the actions were a kind of political theater, which they say is free speech protected by the First Amendment.",
      "Both are asking for charges against their clients to be dropped because they say no one was threatened by the cross set on fire in the middle of the night, which no one other than the defendants apparently saw.",
      "According to the indictment, Bernard communicated with Mobolade before the cross-burning on April 23, 2023, and after Mobolade won election in a May 6, 2023, runoff election.",
      "About a week before the cross-burning, Bernard told the then-candidate in a Facebook message that he was, \u201cmobilizing my squadron in defense and for the final push. Black ops style big brother. The klan cannot be allowed to run this city again.\u201d",
      "They spoke for about five minutes on the telephone three days after the incident.",
      "Mobolade has denied having any knowledge, warning or involvement in the crime.",
      "A city spokesperson, Vanessa Zink, on Tuesday referred a reporter to a video statement that Mobolade posted on social media in December, shortly after the three were indicted. In it, the mayor said he knew Bernard as a \u201clocal media personality.\u201d",
      "Mobolade also showed a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice saying he had been identified as a victim or potential victim during the investigation into the cross burning. He said he willingly provided all communications sought by investigators."

    "summary": "The Texas family was on their way to an emergency medical checkup, they said, when they were detained at an immigration checkpoint.",
    "story": [
      "A family that was deported to Mexico hopes they can find a way to return to the U.S. and ensure their 10-year-old daughter, who is a U.S. citizen, can continue her brain cancer treatment.",
      "Immigration authorities removed the girl and four of her American siblings from Texas on Feb. 4, when they deported their undocumented parents.",
      "The family\u2019s ordeal began last month, when they were rushing from Rio Grande, where they lived, to Houston, where their daughter\u2019s specialist doctors are based, for an emergency medical checkup.",
      "The parents had done the trip at least five other times in the past, passing through an immigration checkpoint every time without any issues, according to attorney Danny Woodward from the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal advocacy and litigation organization representing the family. In previous occasions, the parents showed letters from their doctors and lawyers to the officers at the checkpoint to get through.",
      "But in early February, the letters weren\u2019t enough. When they stopped at the checkpoint, they were arrested after the parents were unable to show legal immigration documentation. The mother, who spoke exclusively to NBC News, said she tried explaining her daughter\u2019s circumstances to the officers, but \u201cthey weren\u2019t interested in hearing that.\u201d",
      "Other than lacking \u201cvalid immigration status in the U.S.,\u201d the parents have \u201cno criminal history,\u201d Woodward said.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which detained and deported the family, according to their lawyer, said in an email: \"For privacy reasons, we do not comment on individual cases.\"",
      "The 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. Doctors \u201cpractically gave me no hope of life for her, but thank God she\u2019s a miracle,\u201d the mother said.",
      "The swelling on the girl\u2019s brain is still not fully gone, the mother said, causing difficulties with speech and mobility of the right side of her body. Before the family was removed from the U.S., the girl was routinely checking in with doctors monitoring her recovery, attending rehabilitation therapies and taking medication to prevent convulsions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult thing,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI don\u2019t wish anyone to go through this situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is happening to this family is an absolute tragedy and it is something that is not isolated to just them,\u201d said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project.",
      "\u201cThis is part of a pattern in practice that we\u2019ve seen in the Trump administration,\u201d Garza said, adding that she has heard of multiple other cases concerning mixed-status families. But for now, this is the only case of this nature the organization has taken on.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, has said\u00a0\u201cfamilies can be deported together\u201d regardless of status.  Homan said it would be up to the parents to decide whether to depart the U.S. together or leave their children behind.",
      "But undocumented parents of U.S.-born children, if picked up by immigration authorities, face the risk of losing custody of their children. Without a power-of-attorney document or a guardianship outlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for the parents to regain custody of their children in the future.",
      "According to the girl's mother, she recalled feeling like she could \u201cnot do anything,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cYou\u2019re between a rock and a hard place.\u201d",
      "NBC News is withholding the name of the mother and the rest of the family members, since they were deported to an area in Mexico that is known for kidnapping U.S. citizens.",
      "In addition to the parents and their 10-year-old sick daughter, four of their other children, ages 15, 13, 8, and 6, were also in the car when they were detained. Four of the five children were born in the U.S.",
      "According to the mother, the family was taken to a detention center following the arrest, where the mom and daughters were separated from her husband and sons and she realized she wouldn't be taking her daughter to her doctors.",
      "\u201cThe fear is horrible. I almost can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s something frustrating, very tough, something you wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone,\u201d she said, adding that her sick daughter was laying on a cold floor beneath incandescent lights.",
      "Hours later, the family was placed in a van and dropped on the Mexico side of a Texas bridge, the mother said. From there, they sought refuge in a nearby shelter for a week.",
      "The family has since moved into a house, but the mom said that safety concerns keep them up at night and the children haven't been able to go to school.",
      "The 10-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son, who lives with a heart disorder known as Long QT syndrome, which causes irregular heartbeats and can be life-threatening if not treated well, have not received the health care they need in Mexico, their mother said. The teen wears a monitor that tracks his heart rate.",
      "\u201cThe authorities have my children\u2019s lives in their hands,\u201d she said in tears.",
      "Both parents arrived to the U.S. from Mexico in 2013 and settled in Texas hoping for \u201ca better life for the family,\u201d the mother said. She and her husband both worked a string of different jobs to support their six children. The couple also has a 17-year-old son they left behind in Texas following their deportation.",
      "Just two weeks ago, another undocumented mother in California caring for her 21-year-old daughter, a U.S. citizen undergoing treatment for bone cancer, was detained by immigration authorities and later released under humanitarian parole.",
      "\"We are calling on the government,\" Garza said, \"to parole the family in, to correct the harm that they've made and to not do this to anyone else.\""

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer finally staked out his position, saying Democrats wouldn\u2019t provide the votes to pass the GOP\u2019s six-month continuing resolution. The measure requires 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Republicans only control 53 seats.",
      "\u201cFunding the government should be a bipartisan effort but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats. Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR,\u201d Schumer said.",

There\u2019s talk of a Trump call to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the offing. During the past week, the administration pummeled Ukrainian President Zelenskyy into submission by withholding weapons and intelligence from Ukraine.",
      "What leverage does the U.S. have with Putin? Trump said today he could \u201cdo things financially that would be very bad for Russia.\u201d He has mentioned the possibility of sanctions, but with China, North Korea and Iran helping keep Russia afloat, existing sanctions on Russia have been largely ineffective.",
      "And in almost all of Trump\u2019s statements and actions since returning to the White House, he is again demonstrating an affinity for the Russian president. When Russia was, by Trump\u2019s own admission, \u201cbombing the hell out of Ukraine\u201d after the U.S. halted military aid, Trump said he still thought Putin wanted peace, saying \u201che\u2019s doing what anybody else would do.\u201d",
      "Despite U.S. assessments that Russian-based hackers are responsible for Salt Typhoon, a massive hacking of U.S. targets, the administration is firing top counterintelligence experts at the CIA and FBI, and welcoming back Russian diplomatic missions previously expelled from the U.S. for espionage activities. The U.S. also sided with Russia, China and Belarus at the United Nations against a resolution supporting Ukraine. And all of this comes amid Trump\u2019s continual searing criticism of NATO and the European Union, stunning America\u2019s traditional Western allies and closest \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence partners.",
      "With Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying \u201cthe ball is in Russia\u2019s court,\u201d it is likely in Russia\u2019s interest to accept the ceasefire and instead try to defeat Zelenskyy at the negotiating table.

      "So despite White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, \u201cWe are at the 10th-yard line and the president is expecting the Russians to help us run this into the end zone,\u201d it would be wise to avoid declaring \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d",

    "summary": "Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Florida congressman and physician, is set to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing Thursday for his nomination to lead the CDC.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Florida congressman and physician, is set to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing Thursday for his nomination to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unknown to many in the general public, he\u2019s well known in anti-vaccine circles.",
      "As director, experts say Weldon, 71, could serve as a key ally to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the CDC and appears to share similar views, particularly on vaccines.",
      "On Thursday, Weldon is expected to face questions from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee about how he would manage an agency with a $9 billion budget and a staff of over 13,000, before the Trump administration job cuts.",
      "Weldon served 14 years in the House until 2009, largely staying out of the public spotlight. During this time, however, he attracted the attention of anti-vaccine groups due to his criticisms of the CDC and questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Like Kennedy, Weldon has promoted the false claim linking vaccines to autism \u2014 a matter that the CDC will re-examine under Kennedy, despite decades of research failing to find evidence of a link.",
      "He introduced a bill in 2007 to transfer responsibility for vaccine safety from the public health agency to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea not entirely opposed by some vaccine experts but would significantly reduce the CDC\u2019s role. Within the CDC\u2019s vaccine safety program, it tracks reported side effects. The bill never made it past committees.",
      "According to an account in the 2004 book \u201cEvidence of Harm\u201d by journalist David Kirby, Weldon actively intervened to help anti-vaccine researchers Dr. Mark Geier and his son David access the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC-housed dataset containing patient health records. This raw data is available to researchers, but it isn\u2019t public because of concerns over privacy, misrepresentation of data, and manpower.",
      "In a 2015 interview with Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded, Kennedy suggested Weldon supports his view that the CDC has too cozy of a relationship with vaccine-makers.",
      "What would Weldon accomplish at CDC?",
      "The CDC, in fact, is historically regarded as the gold standard in public health. It does wield significant influence over vaccine recommendations through its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent advisory panel made up of pediatricians, epidemiologists and public health experts. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to cover vaccines recommended by ACIP.",
      "The CDC\u2019s responsibilities go far beyond vaccines. It tracks the flu in the U.S. and warns about infectious disease outbreaks around the world, including Ebola, mpox and tuberculosis.",
      "The CDC was instrumental in alerting about infections and deaths linked to recalled contaminated eye drops in 2023. It investigated the health effects of a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio; reported on fungal infections spreading in nursing homes; and has called attention to the alarming rise in rates of teen despair and suicide. It monitors obesity in the U.S. and rates of heart disease and diabetes.",
      "It was the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics that almost a decade ago helped raise awareness that fentanyl was increasingly a cause of drug deaths in the U.S.",
      "While Weldon is a medical doctor, it\u2019s unclear what his views or general understanding of these other areas are, said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. While in Congress, Weldon advocated for limits on abortion.",
      "\u201cThe director of CDC is a very important position and has a lot of responsibilities over a lot of aspects of public health,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHistorically, it has had people who have a lot of experience in general, in public health and/or infectious diseases and/or chronic disease prevention. It\u2019s probably the world\u2019s largest public health agency.\u201d",
      "Weldon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Weldon would serve as a key official in addressing multiple ongoing health threats, including the H5N1 bird flu and the measles outbreak in West Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.",
      "Amid the measles outbreak \u2014 which has led to more than 200 cases and two deaths \u2014 Kennedy has downplayed the significance of vaccinations, instead doubling down on supplements like vitamin A and cod liver oil, which do not prevent infection.",
      "Experts weren\u2019t so sure Weldon \u2014 who has previously questioned vaccine safety \u2014 would do much to help matters there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to understand why he\u2019s qualified to do the job,\u201d Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said of Weldon. \u201dWhat does he bring to the table that is so compelling based on his experiences, and other than being opposed to the way that we protect millions of Americans through vaccines?\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "It\u2019s possible that committee chair Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., could ask Weldon to make commitments similar to those he asked of Kennedy, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy researcher at the University of California Law San Francisco \u2014 although it\u2019s unclear how effective that might be.",
      "In a February speech supporting Kennedy\u2019s HHS nomination, Cassidy said Kennedy had promised to give the Senate notice before making changes to certain vaccine programs and that he would maintain ACIP \u201cwithout change.\u201d",
      "Since Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, however, HHS has overseen several changes, including canceling or postponing two major vaccine advisory committee meetings. The CDC also launched a database listing information about current or former members of ACIP, including what it describes as conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cKennedy has been at the very least violating the spirit, probably even the language, of the commitments,\u201d Reiss said. Neither Cassidy nor Kennedy has responded to multiple previous requests for comment.",
      "The nomination comes as childhood vaccination rates are falling. Fewer than 93% of kindergarteners had received all of their state-required vaccinations in the 2023-2024 school year, compared with 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues.",
      "\u201cEven in 2017, during the first Trump administration, anti-vaccine activists were floating his name as potential for CDC director,\u201d Reiss said.",
      "At the time, the role went to Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned in 2018 after reports disclosed she had bought stocks in tobacco companies.",
      "O\u2019Leary worries about the implications of having a CDC director who may not fully support vaccines and promotes false claims, such as a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "\u201cThe science there is very clear and has been for decades,\u201c O\u2019Leary said. \u201cTo look into that again, seems like a big waste of resources.\u201d",
      "Creech said physicians continue to see vaccine-preventable diseases.",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019re about to see, in our opinion, we\u2019re going to see larger waves of these communicable diseases, and it\u2019s going to be really frustrating for us who care for these kids in a hospital,\u201d Creech said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be even worse for the families that care for them.\u201d"

    "summary": "Comedian and former \"SNL\" writer John Mulaney hosts Netflix's new talk show \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney,\" which is set to run for 12 weeks.",
    "story": [
      "Live from Los Angeles, it\u2019s John Mulaney.",
      "The comedian\u2019s new talk show debuts on Netflix on Wednesday night, marking the streaming giant\u2019s latest push into live broadcasting. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Live With John Mulaney\u201d will run weekly for 12 episodes with its first featuring musician Joan Baez, actors Michael Keaton and Fred Armisen, and San Francisco Chronicle personal finance columnist Jessica Roy.",
      "Live programming has been a hit for Netflix, but Mulaney enters the late-night scene at a time when the biggest shows have found serious competition for attention from a rising crop of internet-native voices who are increasingly making their way to TV screens. Celebrities remain a mainstay on talk shows but are just as likely to generate buzzy moments when appearing on popular podcasts like Alex Cooper\u2019s \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d or \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d",
      "The comedian appears unfazed by the challenges of the late-night format.",
      "\u201cWe will never be relevant,\u201d\u00a0Mulaney joked to reporters at Next on Netflix in January. \u201cWe will never be your source for news. We will always be reckless. Netflix will always provide us with data that we will ignore.\u201d",
      "The data for most of Netflix\u2019s live programming has been pretty good. The platform drew in huge audiences for its first NFL games on Christmas Day (which featured a halftime show headlined by Beyonc\u00e9), as well as its hyped boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Last year, Mulaney\u2019s six-part live comedy special, \u201cJohn Mulaney Presents: Everybody\u2019s in L.A.,\u201d also proved to be a hit for Netflix, helping pave the way for the new, nonlimited series.",
      "With its new talk show, there\u2019s few live TV formats Netflix hasn\u2019t tried.",
      "\u201cIt was inevitable that Netflix was going to do this,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of television and pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cI think just like anything else, streaming companies are saying: \u2018We\u2019ve done dramas very successfully. We\u2019ve done comedies. What about this other major genre, which is late-night comedy?\u201d",
      "Others have already seen success. HBO's \"Real Time With Bill Maher,\" for example, is now in its 23rd season.",
      "For Netflix to stand out, it will likely need to experiment with the format, Thompson said.",
      "The show has to \u201cfigure out, how do we do this differently when people aren\u2019t simply watching it at 11:30 at night?\u201d Thompson said. If Mulaney is successful, he can help transform the old-fashioned familiar genre.",
      "Having Mulaney\u2019s show \u201cair\u201d only once a week is part of that effort.",
      "Like with \u201cEverybody\u2019s in L.A.,\u201d Mulaney plans to feature a mix of celebrities, comedians, experts and academics with his new show.\u00a0 Richard Kind will return as Mulaney\u2019s sidekick and emcee. Saymo, the delivery bot from \u201cEverybody\u2019s in L.A.,\u201d will also be featured. Mulaney said he will continue to take calls from viewers.",
      "The streaming service has a long-standing relationship with the Emmy-winning Mulaney, who has had five of his stand-up specials on the service. In recent years, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer has become even more of a household name, elevating his comedy with candor about getting sober; falling in love with his now-wife, Olivia Munn; and fatherhood. Mulaney serves as the new talk show\u2019s host, co-showrunner and executive producer through his company, Multiple Camera Productions.",
      "Late-night shows have been a mainstay for the broadcast networks going back many decades but suffered declines in viewership and ad revenue in recent years. Some shows have downsized.",
      "And while the internet has eaten into the relevance of late-night shows, it has also offered them a new way to reach people. Some of the genre\u2019s success now comes when it repurposes standout moments from episodes for the internet.",
      "\u201cLate-night television shows have managed to survive because you can slice and dice, chop them up and put them onto streaming,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had over 60 years of real success with this type of programming,\u201d Thompson added. \u201cStreaming is going to have to adjust how we watch it, but it seems too rich of a mine to not to continue to try and get stuff out of.\u201d"

      "Pastor Leroy McClelland, who lives in Johnson\u2019s southwestern Louisiana district and volunteers at a local food bank, said he is dependent on Medicaid and food stamps after having suffered several medical issues and would be in a serious \u201cbind\u201d without government assistance.\u00a0He added\u00a0that\u00a0he\u2019s far from alone in those struggles.",
      "\u201cPeople can\u2019t do without it,\u201d McClelland told NBC News outside the food bank. \u201cSo I would tell them [Congress] to help us out. Help us. People are hurting out here. And you may be from Louisiana, but you\u2019re the House speaker. Cross the aisle. Work together to do whatever you got to do. That\u2019s my message.\u201d",
      "Summer Stinson, a mother of four who was picking up food for her family as well as an elderly woman who can\u2019t drive, said the prospect of cuts to social safety net programs has been weighing heavily on her mind.",
      "\u201cMy children are on Medicaid. So yes, I do. I do fear that very much, and they make it to where insurance isn\u2019t really affordable with our companies,\u201d said Stinson, a native of Vinton. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would do without it.\u201d",
      "In Johnson\u2019s rural Louisiana district, nearly 25% of adults under age 65 rely on Medicaid, according to an NBC News analysis, while nearly 20% of households receive food stamps.\u00a0Politically,\u00a0it\u2019s a deep-red district that Johnson won with 85% of the vote in November. Louisiana was one of the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and the program now covers 72 million people across the country.",
      "Both anti-poverty programs could be on the chopping block as Republicans hunt for deep spending cuts that were outlined in a recent\u00a0budget resolution the GOP-controlled House passed\u00a0designed to unlock President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda. While the budget blueprint itself doesn\u2019t spell out any policy changes, it does call for steep spending cuts from the committees that oversee Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "Johnson and Trump have insisted that Medicaid benefits won\u2019t be cut.\u00a0The speaker\u2019s office\u00a0pointed NBC News to recent comments Johnson has made when he has been asked for comment.\u00a0He has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0said\u00a0Republicans are only looking to root out waste, fraud and abuse, as well as making reforms to strengthen the programs.",
      "\u201cMedicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d Johnson told reporters at a recent weekly news conference. \u201cEverybody is committed to preserving Medicaid benefits for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it. What we\u2019re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "But there\u2019s skepticism in Congress \u2014 and from the nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0\u2014 that they can achieve those levels of savings without\u00a0cuts to\u00a0Medicaid and SNAP.",
      "A major Medicaid change Republicans are seriously considering is instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults. Yet here in Vinton \u2014 a small rural town with many low-income residents who are struggling with the cost of goods and groceries \u2014 people say there simply aren\u2019t many job opportunities. Those who do have jobs say their hours have been cut. And there\u2019s no reliable transportation to travel to jobs in neighboring towns.",
      "One block in the downtown area is lined with\u00a0several\u00a0shuttered businesses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great community. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s low-income for the most part. And so what we do is we just try to help out by helping them with the extras that their food ain\u2019t stretching all the way. ... They really need it,\u201d said Pastor Don Snider of Christian Life Church, who started the food bank 10 years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s no transportation. And the problem with it is, in this community ... there\u2019s no industry here.\u201d",
      "Snider has expanded the operation over the years, and\u00a0he said\u00a0he now feeds roughly 350 families a week, or 7,000 people a month. He relies on a mix of donations and help from the U.S. Agriculture Department. But the volume of food can vary from month to month, meaning sometimes fewer people get fed or they are given less food.",
      "As grocery prices have soared, the community has struggled, and more residents have come to rely on the food bank. Making matters worse, the area is also still recovering from natural disasters.",
      "\u201cThey lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost their cars, lost everything, basically, and then this is what they depend on to eat. So I\u2019m here every week,\u201d said\u00a0Angel\u00a0Lejune, who picked up food for six other families and loaded her sedan to the brim. \u201cSome people couldn\u2019t survive or make it without these resources. ... And medicine, let\u2019s not talk about that.\u201d",
      "Cars were lined up around the block to collect baskets of produce, bread, meat and other donated goods. Some people traveled in cars and picked up food for multiple families who don\u2019t have cars, while others traveled by bicycle or foot and piled food into wagons.",
      "One of the residents who drove to the food bank Tuesday morning was Dwayne Dousay of Lake Charles. He is a retired environmental microbiologist and the primary caregiver for his adult-age disabled grandson, who receives Medicaid and other forms of government assistance from the state.",
      "Dousay voted for Johnson and is widely supportive of the Trump administration\u2019s push to rein in federal spending under the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 but he also warned that taking a hatchet to social safety net programs would be devastating for his family and the community.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we would do without them. I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s been tough,\u201d Dousay said. \u201cI appreciate what DOGE is doing, but I feel it\u2019s Congress\u2019 decision.\u201d"

    "summary": "The launch of four astronauts to the space station was delayed on Wednesday. The flight is a key step towards the return of NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts will have to wait a bit longer for their journey to the International Space Station.",
      "Mission controllers called off a planned launch Wednesday because of an issue with one of the clamp arms that holds the SpaceX rocket in place on the launch pad.",
      "NASA has yet to announce a new launch date and time.",
      "The routine launch attempt was closely watched because it would have kicked off a series of events culminating in the long-awaited flight back to Earth for NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.",
      "Williams and Wilmore were expected to stay on the ISS for just a week as part of the first crewed test flight of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft in June, but problems with the vehicle forced them to remain in orbit, where they\u2019ve now been for nine months.",
      "Wednesday's launch, a mission known as Crew-10, was scrubbed with about 43 minutes left in the countdown clock. Liftoff was scheduled for 7:48 p.m. ET from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The four crew members \u2014\u00a0NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 were already strapped inside their space capsule.",
      "NASA officials said that there are additional opportunities for the launch this week \u2014 at 7:26 p.m. ET Thursday and at 7:03 p.m. ET Friday \u2014 but that the decision will depend on whether the hydraulics issue with the clamp arm can be resolved in time.",
      "Whenever the members of Crew-10 do arrive at the space station, they will take over for Williams, Wilmore and two fellow crew members onboard. Then preparations will be underway for the astronauts to finally return home.",
      "The Boeing capsule on which Williams and Wilmore launched encountered several issues during its docking process at the ISS, including malfunctioning thrusters. Because of those problems, NASA decided to bring the Starliner craft back to Earth with no one onboard, leaving the pair to wait for a ride back to Earth.",
      "The two will travel home in a SpaceX Dragon capsule that arrived at the space station in September, carrying NASA astronaut Nick Hague, Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov and two empty seats for their colleagues.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov will return to Earth with Wilmore and Williams, capping their monthslong mission at the ISS.",
      "The unusual situation became a political talking point for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, who have made unsubstantiated claims that the Biden administration held up the flight back to Earth for political reasons. Trump said recently that he had tasked Musk with bringing the astronauts home, but NASA\u2019s plan to use a SpaceX vehicle for their return journey has remained the same since it was announced in\u00a0August.",
      "NASA has not yet announced a date for the outgoing crew\u2019s undocking and landing. There is typically a short handover period after new crew members arrive at the space station, during which all the astronauts can exchange information about ongoing science experiments, maintenance projects and other protocols."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:11:11 GMT",
    "summary": "After meeting with his conference, the Senate minority leader said \"Republicans do not have the votes\" to advance the House-approved measure, which requires 60 to pass.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that Democrats would reject a government funding bill that Republicans wrote and passed through the House, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before Friday night's deadline.",
      "The House on Tuesday narrowly approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through the end of September.",
      "\u201cFunding the government should be a bipartisan effort, but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats. Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR,\u201d Schumer said on the floor, calling for a one-month funding bill that provides more time to negotiate a deal.",
      "\u201cOur caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.\u201d",
      "He spoke after a lunch meeting between Democratic senators on Wednesday. They went in torn over whether to vote for the House's six-month measure, with some worried that a shutdown would be worse, even as they widely disapprove of the House bill.",
      "The government will shut down at the end of Friday without a new funding law signed by President Donald Trump, who has endorsed the House legislation. Republicans control 53 Senate seats and need 60 votes to defeat a filibuster.",
      "\u201cThere are not the votes right now to pass it,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters after the meeting. \u201cDemocrats had nothing to do with this bill. And we want an opportunity to get an amendment vote or two. And so that\u2019s what we are insisting on.\u201d",
      "Still, some Democrats fear that a shutdown would be worse than accepting the bill, even though they didn't have input on crafting it.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, both outcomes are bad,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters Wednesday. \u201cElections have consequences, but this is an extreme bill. If it passes, it will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground.\u00a0If the government shuts down, that will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground, and so that is the dilemma in which we found ourselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdditionally, the problem I have with the bill is that I think it advances this project that we\u2019re seeing come from the executive branch, this power grab that does not respect that the power of the purse is with the Congress,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the room where Democrats held their lunch meeting, reporters could hear senators loudly making their point to their colleagues inside as the party tried to solve for a problem with two outcomes they aren\u2019t interested in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m weighing the badness of each option,\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who didn\u2019t take a position on the bill.",
      "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has said he will support the stopgap funding bill because it is preferable to a government shutdown.",
      "Many Senate Democrats said they want a one-month bill to finish work on a new appropriations agreement. Others said they disapprove of the House bill's boost to military spending and the cuts to nondefense domestic programs. And still others say they want guardrails on Elon Musk's powers to dismantle the government without congressional approval.",
      "Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said Democrats \u201care unified in not wanting to shut down the government, and what we need to do is vote on the short-term\u201d bill for one month.",
      "But Republicans have little appetite for the one-month measure and are resigned to a continuing resolution through the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The White House has pressured the party to get the issue off its plate so it can focus on a multitrillion-dollar, Republican-only bill to advance Trump's legislative agenda on the border and taxes and in other policy areas.",
      "House Republicans passed the six-month government funding measure on a nearly party-line vote of 217-213. And with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as a firm no, at least eight Democrats will be needed to break a filibuster in the Senate.",
      "Some Democratic senators and aides worry that supporting the bill would set a bad precedent \u2014\u00a0they would effectively be telling House Republicans that they can write government funding measures without Democrats at the negotiating table.",
      "\"That's also one of the issues with what we're faced here,\" Kelly said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he\u2019s open to having a conversation with Senate Democrats about an amendment vote on a short-term stopgap funding bill.",
      "\u201cI think right now, they\u2019re still trying to figure out how they want to see this wrap up,\u201d Thune told reporters. \u201cBut in the end, the vehicle that\u2019s available to us \u2014 and the House is long gone \u2014 that funds the government is the is the CR that came over from the House.\u201d",
      "The House is on recess and isn't scheduled to return to Washington until March 24.",
      "Another Senate Republican said it's too late to change the bill now.",
      "\u201cThe problem is, if it passes here, then the House is gone and we get a shutdown on Friday,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Wednesday. \u201cSo I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be an amendment vote on the short term CR, I could be wrong.\u201d",
      "Time is quickly running out. The Senate can\u2019t vote on any bill by the Friday midnight deadline unless all 100 senators agree to skip the hurdles.",
      "\u201cAt least for now, I don\u2019t see the votes. Based on my reading of the end of the meeting, I don\u2019t see the votes there right now for passing the House Republican\u201d bill Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Republicans are betting that Democrats won't have the appetite to allow a shutdown despite their disagreements with the House bill.",
      "Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., slammed House Republicans for cutting Democrats out of the process and said they will be blamed for a potential shutdown.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are in charge of the Senate, in charge of the House, and have the White House. The American people know who\u2019s in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for Republicans to try to blame the party that\u2019s the minority everywhere.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, at their retreat in Leesburg, Virginia, House Democrats urged their Senate colleagues to block the bill. All but one, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, voted against the funding bill Tuesday.",
      "\"We\u2019re asking Senate Democrats to vote no on this continuing resolution, which is not clean, and it makes cuts across the board,\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said. \"And it\u2019s going to be one of those things where people are going to look at this vote and every bad thing that now happens with DOGE and Donald Trump, Elon Musk, you can go back to this vote. So we\u2019re asking the Senate Democrats to vote no.\""

      "The 58-year-old singer provided an update about her living situation in a video posted on her YouTube account March 11. Robinson created the social media account in 2022 and regularly uploaded videos on the platform. But after posting in September 2024, she disappeared from the website.",
      "When she returned on March 11, she began her video by explaining that she had to \u201cdeal\u201d with some aspects of her life and needed to step away.",
      "She vaguely touched on what she wanted to reveal, saying that some people in her life were worried she would be judged by what she had to share. \u201cPart of being human is being vulnerable,\u201d she said before addressing the changes in her life.",
      "\u201cYou guys, for the past three years, I have been living in my car,\u201d she shared and let out a scream. \u201cI said it! Oh my God, it\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "Robinson explained that in 2020 she was living with her parents in Las Vegas. They got along at first before she started butting heads with her mom. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand. I still don\u2019t and it hurt me,\u201d she recalled. The musician decided to leave and slept in her car for about a month before her co-manager at the time contacted her.",
      "He advised her to return to Los Angeles. He also said she could move in with him, Robinson claimed.",
      "\u201cThen when I got to his place, he actually didn\u2019t have room for me,\u201d she remembered. She said he checked her into a hotel for a night, but she ended up residing there for eight months.",
      "While searching for apartments, she told her assistant that she started researching \u201ccar life,\u201d discovering people who lived in their vans, cars and RVs.",
      "\u201cI loved what I was seeing. I just thought, \u2018Wow I can do that. I can do this,\u2019\u201d she said. Robinson added that that was three years ago, on March 9, 2022, and she has been living in her vehicle ever since.",
      "She also opened up in the video about her relationship with her family. Robinson said that she is estranged from her sister and has three people in her life: Vilma, her \u201cforever mother-in-law,\u201d her assistant and her brother.",
      "As a woman and a celebrity, Robinson said that she hadn\u2019t let many people know she was alone in her car to protect her safety. However, she said she felt \u201cfree\u201d in her current living situation.",
      "\u201cI felt like, \u2018Wow, this is so different.\u2019 I felt like I was on a camping trip,\u201d she explained. She later shared that she has a gym membership so she has a place to shower.",
      "The powerful vocalist, heard on En Vogue\u2019s hits like \u201cHold On\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Go,\u201d said she has no regrets and pointed out that many celebrities have had to sleep in their cars.",
      "\u201cThis is not like, \u2018Oh my God, poor Dawn. She\u2019s living in her car. It\u2019s terrible, Oh, woe is me,\u2019\u201d she told fans. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m learning about who I am. I\u2019m learning myself as a person (and) as a woman.\u201d",
      "Although she would\u2019ve never thought when she was in En Vogue that one day she would be living in her car, she said she is proud of herself and enjoying documenting her \u201cadventure\u201d for fans.\u00a0She hoped that revealing this news would inspire fans and give them the courage to try anything.",
      "At the end of the video, she said, \u201cWhen I succeed again, because I will, when I\u2019m on top again or when I have a resurgence in my career again, the way that I want, getting to that point is only up to me. So from my car into that life is going to be amazing.\u201d"

      "In the show, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey, a Philly cop and a single mom struggling to make ends meet on one income. When multiple women die of overdoses in close succession, Mickey realizes that it might not be a coincidence. She's further motivated to find an answer because her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), struggles with addiction and has been missing.",
      "Moore's most recent book, \"The God of the Woods,\" came out last summer. Both made it into Barack Obama's annual round-ups of recommended reading. She also co-wrote the adaptation of \"Long Bright River\" along with showrunner Nikki Toscano.",

      "Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY's parent company.",
      "There's an element of bringing awareness to what it is to be somebody in active addiction, to be somebody in recovery or to be the family member of somebody who struggles with substance use disorder. What this does is bring a light specifically \u2014 it's a love story between sisters.",
      "I'm very happy it's set in Philadelphia, where I've lived for 16 years, and we were able to do local casting to bring actors from Philly, and non-actors from Philly, on set to play large and small roles.",
      "I think they're fundamentally different shows. I think we offer a look at actual Philadelphia. It's a very urban show. It also examines a pretty marginalized and underserved community. I hope it offers a pretty nuanced vision of the city of Philadelphia and runs counter to the negative media that the city and neighborhood have received in the past.",
      "I've corresponded with a lot of readers since the book was published in 2020, and they\u2019ve shared really, really moving things with me. I\u2019ve heard from people in recovery from addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have lost loved ones to addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have are happily sharing a story of a loved one who who\u2019s in recovery as well. And I think that was really important to us in \"Long Bright River,\" to portray \"Long Bright River\" as something from which it is possible to recover \u2014 and telling a good, propulsive mystery at the same time.",
      "I think it was important to all of us who wrote on the series to tell a really good story and to prioritize good storytelling, rather than writing like to a particular set of themes. Because I think when you're writing to a theme or two themes, sometimes your characters can end up feeling kind of like weighed down by that.",
      "Character first, place first, story first \u2014 everything else is a byproduct of that.",
      "For viewers who have read the book, I think the heart of the book is very much still in the series \u2014 but I think they may possibly also be surprised by certain departures, hopefully in a good way.",
      "We changed one major character (Ed. note: G, Mickey's grandfather in the show) from a woman in the book to a man in the show, partly because we thought it would be fun to incorporate Mummer culture. It\u2019s a very big part of Philly culture. The mummers are groups of musicians and performers and who dress up and form parade units on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "As far as I know this, it hasn\u2019t really been portrayed much in pop culture.",
      "No, I never do. I never outline. I know a very limited amount of information when I begin a novel, and it's where the novel is set, who the main character characters are and what the initial problem is that they have to solve \u2014 but I don't know the answer to the problem.",
      "So in the case of \"Long Bright River,\" I did not know who was responsible for the deaths of the the victims, I did not know where Mickey's sister had gone and I did not know whether there would be a connection between those two things."

      "\u201cTemptation Island\u201d originally aired on Fox from 2001 to 2003 before it was revived and relocated to USA Network from 2019 to 2023. Then, the reality show took a hiatus for a few years before returning on a new platform: Netflix.",
      "On March 12, the streamer released all 10 episodes of its first season of \u201cTemptation Island,\u201d featuring some of the same elements from the past and a few new twists, like a secret camera-free tent.",
      "In the premiere, host Mark L. Walberg, who has helmed the series since it debuted more than 20 years ago, introduced viewers to the four couples who signed up for the wild experiment: Shant\u00e9 Glover and Brion Whitley, Ashley Moore and Grant Larsen, Alexa Santamaria and Lino Troisi and Tayler Byrd and Tyler Breshears.",
      "Each couple arrived on the island hoping to find answers to questions that have stalled their relationships. After explaining their problems to Walberg, they were introduced to all the tempters with whom they would live for the next few weeks. The couples then split and moved into separate villas with the tempters and temptresses, where they went on dates and tried to find the clarity they were searching for in their original pairing.",
      "Although the couples did not interact, they saw brief clips every few episodes of what their partners had been up to, which revealed some unfaithful moments and hard truths. Through it all, Walberg encouraged the contestants to tackle their feelings.",
      "During the final bonfire in the finale, all four couples reunited and confronted each other about everything that unfolded, including a threesome and more heartbreaking betrayals. As Walberg explained in the episode, each contestant was then given three options: leave with their original partner, leave with someone new or leave alone.",
      "Read on for a recap of the last episode and find out which couples survived \u201cTemptation Island.\u201d",
      "Brion and Shant\u00e9",
      "The first couple to reunite was Brion and Shant\u00e9. While Shant\u00e9 spent most of the experiment reserved and developing strictly platonic connections with the men at her villa, Brion decided to explore his sexual fantasies. He had a threesome with tempters Courtney Randolph and Alex Zamora. Brion repeatedly expressed that he didn\u2019t have any regrets and that was confident Shant\u00e9 would forgive him. When Shant\u00e9 watched the footage of Brion cheating on her at the bonfire, she remained stoic, though the other women called him out for being disrespectful.",
      "When the two met at the final bonfire, Brion immediately grabbed Shant\u00e9\u2019s hands and pulled her into an embrace. He apologized and sobbed. Walberg explained that they each would be able to speak their minds, uninterrupted, before having a conversation where they could ask all the questions they needed to.",
      "Shant\u00e9 went first, recalling that Brion brought her on the show because he wanted to prove he could have platonic relationships with women. She said his actions made her feel worthless and that their love never mattered to him. She added that he didn\u2019t behave like a man who deserves her and that she also saw clips of him disrespecting the women in his villa.",
      "Brion repeatedly apologized and told Shant\u00e9 he loved her. He said that the man he was before the experiment was \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201csurface-level boyfriend.\u201d He said he wanted to show her he had changed and was ready to be the boyfriend, future husband and father she deserved.",
      "What did they decide? Brion announced his decision first. He said wanted to leave with Shant\u00e9 and build back her trust. After stepping away for a moment and being consoled by a producer, Shant\u00e9 returned to share her decision. She said she wanted to respect herself and potentially see this new version of him, but she had to choose herself for now.",
      "While Brion said he understood, he added that he would\u2019ve never crossed their boundaries in real life. Shant\u00e9 then changed her mind and decided to leave with Brion.",
      "She explained her change of heart, telling the cameras, \u201cI believe in our love. I think that we can make this something special. And I am happy with my decision.\u201d",
      "Tyler and Tayler",
      "Tyler signed up for \u201cTemptation Island\u201d because he wanted to prove to Tayler that she could trust him. But during his time on the show, Tyler quickly developed a connection with cast member Kay Carlson. The two shared kisses and multiple intimate moments.",
      "Tayler arrived at the final bonfire first. When Tyler approached her, he asked for a hug. She shook her head, a glimpse of the icy interaction that followed. She pulled out a letter to share her thoughts on Tyler\u2019s behavior during the experiment. She said she felt \u201cplayed\u201d and that his actions were \u201churtful and extremely disrespectful\u201d to their relationship. Tayler spoke about her growth on the island and said Tyler wouldn\u2019t get to know the new version of her.",
      "Tyler mentioned the bonfire clips he saw that hurt him, particularly a video of Tayler saying he had \u201cb---- tendencies.\u201d He said he felt \u201cclowned\u201d listening to her description and said that she took advantage of his insecurities. He also acknowledged his relationship with Kay, saying that she tempted him and opened his mind to new ideas.",
      "Tayler pointed out it only took 72 hours for him to forget about her. He countered that it was because he realized he could never be the man she hoped he would become.",
      "What did they decide? After tearfully telling Tyler that he was her \u201chome\u201d and \u201csafe place\u201d before they landed on the island, she said it was \u201cgutting\u201d seeing him fall in love with Kay. So, the rest of the experiment she focused on herself and said she realized she wanted to feel chosen. She said that she needed to choose herself and wanted to leave the island alone.",
      "Tyler said he knew their relationship was over and wanted to leave the island with Kay. Tayler wished him the best and walked away. In her final confessional, Tayler said she didn\u2019t feel like she lost anything because of the connections she built.",
      "Kay then joined Tyler, who gushed about her while pointing out their relationship was still in the honeymoon stage. He asked her to leave the island with him and Kay agreed. She told the cameras she was happy to learn that their connection on the island was genuine.",
      "Ashley and Grant",
      "Ashley and Grant, another couple who dealt with infidelity before coming on the show, also struggled during the experiment. Ashley watched clips at the bonfire of multiple sexual encounters between Grant and tempter Natalie Cruz.",
      "At the final bonfire, Ashley put her hand up and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s OK,\u201d when Grant attempted to greet her with a hug. They glared at each other in silence before Walberg asked Grant to speak first.",
      "Grant said that he had \u201cenjoyed chasing\u201d Ashley for most of their relationship but he couldn\u2019t do it anymore because she was \u201cunobtainable.\u201d He expressed his love for her and lamented hurting her. But he said that he felt disrespected and belittled in their relationship.",
      "Ashley began by saying she didn\u2019t have a lot she wanted to talk about. She said she wished Grant had been honest with her before they came on the show and admitted he didn\u2019t have the ability to stay loyal to her. She mentioned that it only took a few days for Grant to cheat on her. \u201cYou\u2019re a serial cheater,\u201d she told him.",
      "He said he went through an emotional rollercoaster as he tried to figure out why their relationship didn\u2019t work. He revealed he had been \u201cforcing\u201d their connection for a long time and that he should\u2019ve called it quits.",
      "What did they decide? Despite his budding connection with Natalie, Grant announced that he wanted to leave the island alone. Ashley said she wanted to depart with her new connection, tempter Danny Spongberg. As Grant cried, she told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting and I\u2019m sorry that we got to this place. I wanted you to be a good man for me and it just wasn\u2019t working.\u201d",
      "They hugged before Grant left. He told the cameras that he liked Natalie but he needed to take time to figure out how to be alone.",
      "Danny entered and Ashley told him she wanted to pursue their connection. He said he wanted to leave with her, too, and they kissed. She praised him for helping bring out a light within her that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.",
      "Alexa and Lino",
      "Alexa and Lino were the only couple to remain faithful throughout the experiment despite the trust issues they revealed in Episode 1. When they first started dating, Alexa was seeing other people even though she told Lino they were exclusive. Throughout their relationship, Lino felt like he was a second option, causing tension between them.",
      "As soon as Alexa saw Lino at the final bonfire, she became emotional. They kissed and repeatedly expressed how much they loved and missed each other. Alexa told him that she grew more on the island than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She said she felt \u201cempty\u201d when they arrived and she thought that was because she was co-dependent in their relationship. But she realized that she is independent and she felt empty because their connection is so special.",
      "She added that she appreciated him, but he could not continue to hold her past decisions over her head.",
      "Lino\u2019s response was concise. He said he thought the show would be a wild and insightful journey but it ended up being \u201carduous.\u201d He learned that he projected his insecurities onto her and apologized. Going forward, he wanted to provide the emotional support she needed and\u00a0said he would leave his trust issues on the island.",
      "What did they decide? Alexa and Lino revealed they wanted to leave together. She told him, \u201cI want to leave with you, the love of my life. There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather choose.\u201d",
      "He replied, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person on the earth that I would leave this island with. You\u2019re the love of my life and the light of my life.\u201d",
      "Walberg congratulated them and the two left, hand in hand. They rounded the corner and saw a path of flowers and candles. Lino took Alexa\u2019s hands and said, \u201cFrom the first moment I saw you all those years ago, I knew you\u2019d be mine.\u201d He gushed that she was the most beautiful and kind woman he had ever known. He promised to cherish her before kneeling to one knee and proposing.",
      "She covered her face and happily said yes. The two popped champagne and toasted before he thanked \u201cTemptation Island\u201d for helping him gain a fianc\u00e9e."

      "In a new interview with Rolling Stone, the 22-year-old singer recalls not feeling connected to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\u00adday Saints, despite his upbringing.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, a lot of people at church would talk about these experiences that they\u2019ve had and these personal revelations and feelings and voices. I never felt it as physically present as they did, and so I was always confused and frustrated,\u201d he told the magazine in a new interview released March 11. \u201cI was always scared to bring that up to people because I just didn\u2019t want to accept that, like, I wasn\u2019t feeling what everyone else was feeling.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u200aMy parents definitely have their own views, but when it comes to religion and God, they want me to figure it out on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whatever I come to, and whatever I feel is right, that\u2019s what they want for me.\u201d",
      "And while he doesn\u2019t consider himself Mormon, he told the magazine that he still abstains from alcohol and drugs. He has, however, had coffee, which is forbidden in the religion, but doesn\u2019t enjoy it.",
      "\u201c\u200aThere was a period of time where I really wanted to like coffee and (would) go out to this place in L.A. with (my girlfriend) Maggie (Thurmon),\u201d he shared. \u201cAnd I would try sips of her coffee every day and it literally tastes like burnt wood.\u201d",
      "But part of his own journey is also deciding for himself to stay away from any addictive substance because of his personality and health.",
      "\u201c\u200aI just think for me personally, like, dude, I would die,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause I have such an addictive personality. I feel like if I started, I would do it so much that my health would just decline and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy touring as much.\u201d",
      "And when it comes to making decisions outside of his former religion, the Grammy-nominated artist said he considers his biggest weakness to be his biggest strength, which is, \u201cWhen I convince my brain of something, I have to do it. There\u2019s no backing out or stepping down.\u201d",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boone attended Brigham Young University, a private Mormon university, for a semester before dropping out to pursue a music career.",
      "He would go on to audition for Season 19 of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d making it to the top 24 \u2014 before also exiting the show. At the time, Boone felt that the show would hold him back than help him have a real music career.",
      "The singer appears to have made a great move with the release of \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d which would go on to become the most-streamed track in the world in 2024, according to Rolling Stone."

      "He was a basketball star at Princeton",
      "Robinson attended Princeton University and made a name for himself on the Princeton Tigers basketball team. In fact, the two-time Ivy League Player of the Year (1981-1982 and 1982-1983), still ranks as the seventh highest scorer in in the team\u2019s history with 1,441 points accrued over the course of his NCAA career.",
      "After graduation, Robinson went pro \u2014 but not in the U.S. Despite being picked by the Philadelphia 76ers in the fourth round of the 1983 NBA draft, he went on to sign with U.K. pros the Manchester Giants.",

      "Robinson recalled, \u201cMy initial concern was that Barack would be so far out of his element that I\u2019d have to protect him on the court \u2014 not wanting him in any way to lose face. The other worry was that he might turn out to be one of those jerks who is oblivious to everyone else on the floor but himself. Almost as soon as we started playing, it was clear that I didn\u2019t have to worry about his competence.\u201d",

      "Mahmoud Khalil was inside a university-owned residence Saturday night near Columbia\u2019s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered his apartment and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press.",
      "Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",
      "\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Sunday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil was arrested in coordination with ICE and the State Department \u201cin support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cKhalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "A Columbia spokesperson said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property, but declined to say if the school had received one ahead of Khalil\u2019s arrest. The spokesperson also declined to comment on Khalil\u2019s detention.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department and ICE.",
      "In a\u00a0message\u00a0shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d",
      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",

      "More than 1,300 people have been killed in 72 hours, according to the organization, including security force members and militants.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",

      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "The AfD has opposed gay marriage and the expansion of laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but Weidel has said her sexuality does not conflict with the AfD\u2019s traditional values, and analysts say the party\u2019s rank and file are prepared to overlook her family life as long as she brings them success.",
      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.",
      "The annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s parliament, is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.",
      "Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People\u2019s Congress does offer clues to China\u2019s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.",
      "Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.",
      "As if to underscore China\u2019s relative steadfastness,\u00a0Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday.\u00a0He used the word \u201cstability\u201d at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.",
      "Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.",
      "\u201cNo country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,\u201d Wang said, slamming what he called a \u201ctwo-faced approach.\u201d",
      "China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn\u2019t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.",
      "\u201cNobody worries about it,\u201d tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.",
      "\u201cWe only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d",
      "China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.",
      "\u201cAppearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that\u2019s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,\u201d said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.",
      "Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission \u201cwill backfire and fail,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina will use a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.\u201d",
      "Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump\u2019s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on \u201cfriend and foe\u201d starting April 2.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech sent the message that \u201cthe U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,\u201d Wang, the professor, said in written comments.",
      "He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.",
      "\u201cBy contrast, China\u2019s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China\u2019s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.",
      "Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.",
      "\u201cChina is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,\u201d he said.",
      "Li acknowledged China\u2019s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, \u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.\u201d",
      "China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.",
      "\u201cTo be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,\u201d said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.",
      "\u201cBut the U.S. will suffer more.\u201d",

Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",

    "story": [
      "In a cave in northern Spain, researchers have discovered pieces of a fossilized face belonging to an ancient human ancestor \u2014\u00a0the oldest human fossil ever found in Western Europe.",
      "The remains, which the team nicknamed \u201cPink,\u201d are between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old. But they\u2019re mysterious: The facial fragments do not seem to come from any species found in the same area in the past, nor can they be conclusively identified as any particular species.",
      "\u201cWe are documenting a previously unknown human population in Europe,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres, a co-author of the study and a paleoanthropologist at the Spanish National Research Center for Human Evolution, said in a call with reporters. \u201cThis fossil represents the earliest human fossil found so far in Western Europe.\u201d",
      "The fragment, discovered in 2022, was first reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday with new details.",
      "The researchers tentatively suggested that Pink is likely related to the human ancestor Homo erectus. (The fossil was named, in part, for the band Pink Floyd, and also after Rosa Huguet, the study\u2019s primary author and the coordinator of the archaeological site where it was found.)",
      "The finding is significant because it gives researchers a better timeline of when Western Europe was first settled by human ancestors. It could also help bridge a gap in evolutionary space between the oldest known human ancestor fossils found in Europe \u2014 which are roughly 1.8 million years old and were discovered at a site in the Republic of Georgia called Dmanisi \u2014 and a species called Homo antecessor, which dates back roughly 900,000 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Dmanisi fossils, which are older, and it\u2019s not like the younger Homo sapien-like anatomy of Homo antecessor. It\u2019s something in between,\u201d said Rodrigo Lacruz, a professor of molecular pathobiology at New York University, who was not involved in the new discovery but has studied the evolution of the human face.",
      "The discovery may therefore help researchers better understand the story of early human evolution and migration in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe can start piecing together what that population could have looked like, and that\u2019s a great value, because you start seeing how anatomy changes over time,\u201d Lacruz said.",
      "The team that discovered Pink said the fossil is from an adult, but they are not sure whether male or female. Pink was found about 60 feet below the top layer of sedimentary rock, at a cave within the Sierra de Atapuerca archaeological site, which is known for the rich historical record in its rock layers.",
      "Within the same sedimentary level as Pink, researchers found stone tools and animal bones with marks made by cutting, which suggests that these early ancestors butchered animals for meat.",
      "Evidence suggests that human ancestors settled Europe in multiple waves, but that most of those populations subsequently contracted and died out. The fossil record is discontinuous at the Atapuerca site and in Western Europe as a whole, indicating that there were likely long periods without human presence.",
      "The study posits that the species Pink belonged to could have overlapped briefly with Homo antecessor. It\u2019s also possible the species was wiped out during a climactic shift that started about 1.1 million years ago and has only recently been identified by researchers.",
      "Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the discovery of Pink, said the climate event \u201cmay have caused a major and perhaps complete human depopulation of western Europe.\u201d",
      "The cave where Pink was discovered, called Sima del Elefante, or elephant chasm, has produced compelling fossils before. In 2007, researchers found a small piece of jawbone that is believed to be about 1.2 million years old, which appears to be closely related to Pink. Pink was found about 6 feet deeper than that fossil, though, which makes scientists believe it\u2019s older.",
      "Martin\u00f3n-Torres said the researchers were shocked to find a new, important fossil even deeper. Her first reaction to the discovery, she said, was: \u201cAm I really dreaming?\u201d",
      "The region\u2019s impressive collection of fossils likely has to do with its geography.",
      "\u201cAtapuerca was a natural corridor between different mountain systems,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said, adding that there was ample water. \u201cIt was probably a place that was ideal for hominins to settle. They have the resources; they have the animals passing by.\u201d",
      "Scientists are still digging at the archaeological site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep excavating,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said. \u201cWe may have more surprises.\u201d"

      "The school's deputy principal, David Hall, told the The Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Romilio's discoveries had been a shock, but also \"a bit exciting.\"",
      "\"It sits in a very public area in our student foyer and our kids walk past it every day, and so do we,\" he said.",
      "He added that the school had ended up with the boulder about 20 years ago when a geologist who was married to one of the school's teachers came across it in a nearby mine.",
      "\u201cThat area was going to be blasted or disturbed with the mining activities, and he saved that specimen and donated it to the school,\u201d Hall added, according to ABC.",
      "After seeing the remarkable rock at the school, Romilio decided to dig into the matter further, and drove to a nearby coal mine in Callide. There, another open-air secret confronted him.",
      "\u201cAs I am coming into the car park, there was this massive boulder with another massive dinosaur footprint that\u2019s just staring at you,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd just my jaw dropped,\" he said, and remembers thinking: \"This is incredible.\u201d",
      "The boulder at the mine contained two footprints, one that was obvious and another half broken and hidden with mud. Together with a third rock that is part of a private collection and encased in resin, researchers have been able to piece together an ancient history of the area.",
      "These records are a critical window into the Jurassic period in Australia, when \u201cthe most common dinosaur fossils are footprints, by several orders of magnitude,\u201d Romilio said.",
      "For now, the school boulder remains where it is, and discussions are underway for it to be relocated to a more public venue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of their community and really a part of their heritage,\u201d Romilio said."

      "The 59-year-old man, who hasn\u2019t been named by authorities, was arrested by police in northeast England on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence over the collision. He hasn\u2019t been charged.",

      "ROME \u2014 The recovery of Pope Francis from double pneumonia continued Wednesday as he inched toward notching some important milestones in his papacy: the 12th anniversary Thursday of his election as pope and a near-record in hospital stays for a pontiff.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that Francis had a quiet night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "If the last few days are any guide, the 88-year-old Argentine will most likely follow the Vatican\u2019s spiritual retreat remotely while his physical and respiratory therapy continues. The pope\u2019s weekly Wednesday general audience was canceled anyway, since the entire Vatican hierarchy is on retreat this week as part of the Lenten spiritual exercises that have been a mainstay of the Jesuit pope\u2019s pontificate.",
      "Doctors have said Francis is making slow, gradual improvements and this week declared that he\u2019s no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of the complex respiratory infection he had when he was admitted on Feb. 14. But they remain cautious, given the complexity of his condition and overall fragility, and say he needs to remain hospitalized for an unspecified number of days.",
      "Another medical update was expected later Wednesday.",
      "Thursday marks the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election as the 266th pope. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave that was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned. While Francis has praised Benedict\u2019s humility in stepping down and said that he too might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said that the papacy is a job for life.",
      "The Holy See hasn\u2019t said how the anniversary, which is a public holiday in the Vatican, might be commemorated this year.",
      "Another milestone comes Friday, when Francis marks four weeks or 28 days of hospitalization. St. John Paul II has the record for a hospital stay, at 55 days in 1981 when he underwent a minor surgical operation and was then treated for a cytomegalovirus infection. Francis is on track to equal the second-longest stay, 28 days, which John Paul recorded in 1994 when he had surgery to repair his right hip joint after he fractured his right femur in a fall, according to Gemelli hospital.",
      "The Vatican has released no photos or video of Francis since he was admitted. The pope recorded an audio message last week to thank people for their prayers, though the weakness and breathlessness of his voice made clear just how frail he was."
