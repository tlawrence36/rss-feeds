      "Diane Keaton has always stood out in Hollywood",
      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Available to rent on various platforms including Prime Video.",
      "\u201cLa-dee-da, la-dee-da\u201d where to even begin with \u201cAnnie Hall?\u201d It is the quintessential Keaton role, a love-letter to her quirks, eccentricities, insecurities and charm all wrapped up in this fictional tie-wearing WASP from Chippewa Falls.",
      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",
      "\u201cNo one had any serious expectations. We were just having a good time moving through New York\u2019s landmark locations,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cAs always, Woody concerned himself with worries about the script. Was it too much like an episode of \u2018The Mary Tyler Moore Show\u2019? I told him he was nuts. Relax.\u201d",

      "\u201cEveryone knew I didn\u2019t take well to Warren\u2019s direction,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cIt was impossible to work with a perfectionist who shot 40 takes per setup. Sometimes it felt like I was being stun-gunned. Even now I can\u2019t say my performance is my own. It was more like a reaction to Warren \u2014 that\u2019s what it was: a response to the effect of Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Streaming on Kanopy.",
      "In this comedy from Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers, Keaton plays a Manhattan yuppie who unexpectedly inherits a 14-month-old and begins to reassess her life, eventually moving to Vermont where she meets a veterinarian played by peak handsome Sam Shepard. An ahead-of-its-time commentary on the have-it-all discourse of the next 30 years, Roger Ebert wrote at the time that \u201c\u2019Baby Boom\u2019 makes no effort to show us real life. It is a fantasy about mothers and babies and sweetness and love, with just enough wicked comedy to give it an edge.\u201d",
      "WHERE TO WATCH: Available to rent on various platforms.",
      "Oh Erica Barry and her fabulous Hamptons home and ivory turtleneck sweaters. This was purely the brainchild of Meyers, the writer-director who had the glorious idea to make a 50-something woman the object of desire in a mainstream romantic comedy. Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "ROME (AP) \u2014 For the first time in nearly 2,000 years, visitors to Rome\u2019s world-renowned Colosseum will have the opportunity to walk through a hidden imperial passage that once allowed Roman emperors to reach the ancient amphitheater unseen.",
      "The once-secret corridor \u2014 known as the \u201cCommodus Passage\u201d and named after the Roman emperor turned into a pop icon by Ridley Scott\u2019s movie \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 opens to the public on Oct. 27, marking an extraordinary milestone in archaeological preservation and access.",
      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who ruled alone between 180 A.D. and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene. But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",

      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \u201cdone and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "Yet much of the most extensive work to give \u201cRoofman\u201d veracity was below the surface. Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",

Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",

Not in his performance as a Yale philosophy professor accused of sexual misconduct in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but while discussing an actor\u2019s responsibility to comment on the work they\u2019re putting out in the world.",
      "It\u2019s a blue-sky day outside the luxurious Hotel Cipriani and Garfield is seated alongside his co-stars Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri discussing a film that has, for better or worse, become the topic of some spirited debates. Just a few days prior at the Venice Film Festival, journalists at a press conference asked Roberts and filmmaker Luca Guadagnino if the film undermines the feminist movement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",

They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield).

Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",

Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",

      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",

      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",

      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",

The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",

But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",

But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted recommendations by a new group of vaccine advisers, and has stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted recommendations by a new group of vaccine advisers, and stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone \u2014 leaving the choice up to patients.",
      "The government health agency on Monday announced it has adopted recommendations made last month by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",
      "As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, experts increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "But Kennedy, who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, abruptly announced in May that COVID-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. He also dismissed the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with a handpicked group.",
      "The new group voted last month to say all Americans should make their own decisions. But the CDC also says vaccine decisions, especially for seniors, should involve checking with a doctor, nurse or pharmacist.",
      "The recommendation was endorsed by Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill, who is serving as the CDC\u2019s acting director. O\u2019Neill signed off on it last week, but HHS officials announced it Monday.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "In a statement Monday, O\u2019Neill celebrated the change, saying past guidance \"deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\u201d",
      "\u201cInformed consent is back,\u201d O'Neill said in a statement some doctors objected to.",
      "Doctors routinely discuss vaccines with patients and parents, and share printed information about the risks and benefits of each shot, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired New York physician who has coauthored several American Academy of Pediatrics policy statements on vaccinations.",

      "O\u2019Neill also signed off on a panel recommendation that children under 4 get their first vaccine dose for varicella \u2014 also known as chickenpox \u2014 as a standalone shot rather than in combination shot with measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "There is a single shot that contains all four, but it carries a higher risk of fevers and fever-related seizures. Since 2009, the CDC had said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already get the chickenpox vaccine separately.",

      "Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.",
      "They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.",
      "The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others \u2014 including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors \u2014 detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.",
      "Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.",
      "The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, \u201cthe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,\u201d said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,\u201d she added in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "Costa's independent cinema is also part of a resistance of venues surviving outside the mall circuit. According to 2024 official data, there were only 423 screening rooms in small theaters like LT3 across the country. In contrast, nearly 90% of Brazil\u2019s 3,542 cinema screens operate inside shopping malls.",
      "Some of the country's most traditional stand-alone cinemas now rely on corporate sponsorships to stay open. Many others have shut down and been demolished. In Sao Paulo, where the buildings remain, the former screening rooms have often been repurposed into evangelical churches or adult movie theaters.",
      "Even the venues that survived have faced the threat of closure in recent years. When that happens, local movie lovers often organize protests \u2014 and in some cases, they succeed. That was the case with Cine Belas Artes, located on one of the city\u2019s most iconic corners, at the intersection of Avenida Paulista.",
      "Maria Am\u00e9lia Marcos, a 71-year-old teacher, was visiting LT3 for the first time on Thursday, though she often goes to other independent theaters around Sao Paulo. She believes these venues are essential to preserving the city\u2019s cultural memory.",
      "\u201cIndependent theaters are very important because they have a completely different appeal,\" she said. The film selection is fantastic. I imagine the curators are very thoughtful people who want audiences to see the kind of movies they themselves would love to watch.\u201d",

      "KYAUKME, Myanmar (AP) \u2014 Ten days after it was recaptured by Myanmar's military government, the town of Kyaukme stands eerily silent. Schools have reopened but the town's once-busy market is mostly empty. Vendors at some stalls closed them at the sight of the visiting journalists, visibly nervous.",
      "The once-thriving town in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State is in shambles, an Associated Press journalist has confirmed on Friday in a rare visit to the war-torn area allowed by the country\u2019s military government.",
      "The local army allowed an AP photographer to join a trip supervised by pro-military Myanmar media, the only representative of foreign media who was permitted to do so. The military doesn\u2019t allow a free press and bars journalists from entering conflict zones independently.",
      "They saw the charred wreckage of official buildings, such as the courthouse, police station and government housing.

      "But civilian houses seemed to be mostly unscathed, except those near damaged official buildings, but most of the town's original population of 46,000 had fled.",
      "The ethnic militia that previously controlled the town accused the army of causing the damage with air strikes and heavy weapons, while the government soldiers who took over the town said the militia destroyed structures as it retreated.",
      "Because of its strategic location on a highway connecting central Myanmar to China, Kyaukme has been much fought over. About 115 kilometers (70 miles) northeast of Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, it has changed hands twice since the army in 2021 ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, setting off the current civil war between the military government and an alliance of militias representing ethnic minorities and pro-democracy activists.",
      "Kyaukme was captured by the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army in August 2024, amid a wave of victories by opponents of military rule that left them apparently in control of most of the country's territory. The TNLA is the guerrilla army of the Palaung ethnic minority.",
      "The town fell back into the hands of the military government on Oct. 1 after a three-week battle, in a significant victory for government forces.",
      "The army has mounted a succession of successful offensives in recent months, ahead of elections set for the end of the year. Critics say the polls will be neither free nor fair, but the army hopes that high turnout will help legitimize the vote.",
      "Before attacking Kyaukme, the army in July recaptured the town of Nawnghkio, considered a gateway to Myanmar\u2019s heartland because it sits at the crossroads of Myanmar's eastern hills and its central flatlands.",

      "Wolfgang Bivour, a renowned fungi expert in Germany, leads mushroom hunting tours near Potsdam",
      "POTSDAM, Germany (AP) \u2014 Wolfgang Bivour carefully emptied a basket of freshly collected mushrooms onto a forest floor covered with fallen autumn leaves. Brown-capped porcini and bay boletes lay beside slimy purple brittlegills and honey-colored armillaria \u2014 and, among them, the lethal green death caps.",
      "Bivour, one of Germany's most famous fungi connoisseurs, described the different species just collected in an oak and beech forest on the outskirts of Potsdam in eastern Germany. Surrounding him were 20 people who listened attentively, among them university students, retirees and a Chinese couple with their 5-year-old daughter.",
      "Across Germany, the traditional forest art of mushroom hunting is enjoying a revival, fed by the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, which pushed people from cramped apartments into forests, and by the growing popularity of the vegan lifestyle. A growing interest in the use of medicinal fungi is also playing a role.",
      "While people in rural areas have gone mushroom picking for ages, city dwellers are now also discovering its joys.",
      "Mushroom hunting was necessity for many in Germany in the difficult years after World War II, when people scoured forests for anything edible. But when West Germany's economy started booming in the 1950s, and economic conditions also improved in East Germany, many turned away from the practice.",
      "In recent years, images of mushrooms have gone viral on social media, and a hobby once considered uncool has become a chic lifestyle pastime.",
      "Bivour, a 75-year-old retired meteorologist, said the tour he led on a recent, drizzly autumn day wasn't \u201cprimarily about filling your basket \u2014 although it\u2019s always nice to find something for the dinner table.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, it was \u201cabout teaching people about the importance of mushrooms in the ecosystem and, of course, about biodiversity.\u201d",
      "Bivour is sometimes sought out by hospitals when they have cases of suspected mushroom poisonings.",
      "He has also been giving mushroom tours in the Potsdam region southwest of Berlin for more than five decades.",
      "When the members of his group showed him mushrooms, he identified them with their German and sometimes their Latin names. He spoke about their healing powers or toxicity, gave suggestions on how to prepare some of them, offered historical anecdotes. He invited them to smell and taste the ones that were not poisonous.",
      "Karin Flegel, the managing director of Urania, a Potsdam institution that organizes Bivour's tours, said his classes are filling up instantly.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a huge increase in interest in mushrooms,\u201d she said.",

      "Many people are embracing their new passion with caution, afraid of accidentally picking and eating poisonous mushrooms.",
      "While the poisonous red-capped, white-dotted fly agaric can be easily identified, the very toxic green death cap is sometimes confused with the common button mushroom, or champignon, which is the most widely sold mushroom in stores across the country.",
      "Each year, several people die after eating death caps, often immigrants from the Middle East who are not familiar with the local mushroom varieties.",
      "Tim Ko\u0308ster, a 25-year-old university student from Berlin who joined the excursion with his girlfriend, said he had never foraged for mushrooms as a child, and is often satisfied with the white button mushrooms in the stores. But he also wants to be able to find and prepare his own porcini mushrooms \u2014 considered the most popular delicacy among Germany\u2019s more than 14,000 different kinds of mushrooms.",
      "While porcini are often served in risotto or pasta in Italian cuisine, in Germany porcini, as well as bay boletes, are often fried in butter and eaten on toasted sourdough bread with salt and pepper.",
      "As Ko\u0308ster stood amid an abundance of yellow and red fall foliage, he said that the tour was a good start. But asked if he was ready to start collecting mushrooms on his own, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t dare yet.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said he considers picking mushrooms and taking them to an expert to verify that they are edible. Experts often offer their knowledge on fall weekends at markets or community colleges where people can bring their bounty and make sure they haven't accidentally pick poisonous pieces.",
      "Margit Reimann, a 42-year-old who participated in the tour with her mother, said she was surprised to learn how many edible mushroom varieties there are.",
      "But despite her newly acquired knowledge, she plans to stick to the familiar ones \u2014 porcini, butter mushrooms, slippery jacks and bay boletes \u2014 when going out to the woods with her kids. During the excursion she learned that colors and grain patterns can't always be clearly determined.",
      "\u201cI think that if enjoyed in moderation, many of them would be a culinary experience, but I still don\u2019t trust myself,\" she said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 At a massive military parade attended by foreign leaders, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rolled out his nuclear-armed military\u2019s most powerful weapons, including a new intercontinental ballistic missile he may be preparing to test in coming weeks.",
      "The parade, which began Friday night in the rain and marked the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, highlighted Kim\u2019s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build an arsenal that could target the continental United States and his rivals in Asia.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that the parade featured a new, yet-to-be-tested intercontinental ballistic missile called the Hwasong-20, which it described as the country's \u201cmost powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.\u201d",

      "The parade saw the debut of the massive Hwasong-20 mounted on an 11-axle launcher truck.

      "The high-level visits highlight Kim\u2019s increasingly assertive foreign policy as he seeks to break out of isolation and establish a larger role for North Korea in a united front against the U.S.-led West. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president\u2019s first term. In a recent speech, Kim urged Washington to drop its demand for the North to surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming diplomacy.",

      "Haiti\u2019s government has pledged to respond quickly to growing hunger in the troubled Caribbean country as a new report warns that more than half the population is experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Haiti\u2019s government pledged Friday a quick response to growing hunger in the troubled Caribbean country as a new report warned that more than half the population is experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse.",
      "At least 5.7 million Haitians are at the crisis level, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency levels of hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on hunger crises.",
      "Last year, some 5.41 million Haitians were at the crisis level, with numbers expected to only increase next year, the report warned.",
      "\u201cThe growing influence of armed groups, combined with structural problems and unfavorable climatic conditions, continues to affect the food security of the Haitian population,\u201d it stated.",
      "Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, a member of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, announced Friday that the government has launched a plan to mobilize resources quickly to those most in need. Officials also created a Food and Nutrition Security Office to ensure effective coordination and an appropriate response to growing hunger, he said.",
      "Hunger continues to surge as growing gang violence has displaced a record 1.3 million people in recent years and deepened poverty, with some 6 million Haitians living on less than $2.41 a day. Meanwhile, the cost of food increased by 33% in July compared with the same month last year.",
      "Gangs control an estimated 90% of Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u2019s capital, and they also have plundered communities in and around Haiti\u2019s central agricultural region in recent months.",
      "\u201cFarmers who have managed to carry out their agricultural activities are forced not only to negotiate access to plots of land but also to share their produce,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHouseholds that relied on small businesses have been forced to abandon their sources of income, and many people have lost their jobs due to the closure of certain businesses located in areas occupied by armed groups.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese returnees\u2026lacked everything and put increasing pressure on already scarce resources,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Among the areas most affected by hunger are makeshift shelters, impoverished communities in Port-au-Prince and Haiti\u2019s northwest and central regions.",

      "LIMA, Peru -- LIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 Peruvians woke up to their seventh president in less than a decade Friday, as 38-year-old Jos\u00e9 Jer\u00ed took the reins of the shaken nation after Congress ousted widely loathed President Dina Boluarte in a lightening overnight impeachment.",
      "The young lawyer with scarce political experience, who just became president of the Congress in July, said shortly after being sworn in early Friday that he would seek \u201creconciliation,\u201d tackle Peru\u2019s runaway crime and ensure \u201cneutrality\u201d in elections when Peruvians elect a new president in April.",
      "Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they said was her government\u2019s inability to stem crime.",
      "They requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort, the ninth attempt to remove her.",
      "The shocking turn of events came just hours after a man open fired at a concert in the capital, injuring five and inflaming anger over crime roiling the country.",
      "Jer\u00ed's rapid ascension was all the more surprising because in August he gave a lengthy interview to Peruvian newspaper El Comercio in which he said he wouldn't replace Boluarte if she were impeached because he believed in \u201cpresidential institutionality and we're so close to the end of her term.\u201d",
      "Boluarte, Peru\u2019s first female president, took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor. Then-President Pedro Castillo was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal.",
      "Boluarte had served as Castillo\u2019s vice president before becoming president, so there was no vice president to take her place when she was removed Friday. Next in line was the president of the Congress, Jer\u00ed.",
      "After Friday's vote, Boluarte spoke on national television, recounting her administration\u2019s achievements.",
      "\u201cI have not thought of myself, but rather of Peruvians,\u201d she said.",
      "Minutes into her speech, the broadcast was interrupted to show Jer\u00ed\u2019s swearing in.",
      "On Friday, the Attorney General's Office asked a judge to prohibit Boluarte from leaving the country while it investigates two cases, one alleged money laundering and the other alleged corruption. The judge did not immediately rule.",
      "In a statement, investigators said that they are looking at money allegedly funneled through Boluarte before her presidency to the fugitive leader of a political party. The other case has to do with Boluarte using her influence as president to do favors for friends, in particular the plastic surgeon who gave her a secret nose job in 2023. She eventually confirmed that she had undergone the procedure.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has long been the face of resistance to Venezuela's 26-year ruling party. Now, she may become a symbol of peace, too.",
      "Machado, the Venezuelan opposition powerhouse who commandeered millions of Venezuelans to reject President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's election, on Friday was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work \u201cto achieve a just and peaceful transition\u201d of power in the South American country. The award also recognized the seasoned politician for being a \u201cunifying figure\u201d in the fractured opposition.",
      "The award, however, is being granted at a time when opposition supporters are questioning her leadership, including her embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump's Venezuela policy, which has seen Venezuelan migrants sent to an infamous prison in Central America and deadly U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean.",
      "Here are some things to know about Machado:",
      "Machado, an industrial engineer and daughter of a steel magnate, began challenging the ruling party in 2004, when the non-governmental organization she co-founded, S\u00famate, promoted a referendum to recall then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The initiative failed, and Machado and other S\u00famate executives were charged with conspiracy.",
      "She drew the anger of Ch\u00e1vez and his allies the following year for her Oval Office meeting with then-U.S. President George W. Bush. Ch\u00e1vez considered Bush an adversary.",
      "Her full transformation into a politician would come until 2010, when she was elected to a seat in the National Assembly, receiving more votes than any aspiring lawmaker ever. It was from this position that she boldly interrupted Ch\u00e1vez as he addressed the legislature and called his expropriation of businesses theft.",
      "\u201cAn eagle does not hunt a fly,\u201d he responded. The exchange is seared in voters\u2019 memories.",
      "Machado, 58, sought Venezuela's presidency for the first time in 2012, but she finished third in the race to be the presidential candidate for the Democratic Unity Roundtable.",
      "The ruling party-controlled National Assembly ousted Machado in 2014 and, months later, the Comptroller General\u2019s Office barred her from public office for a year, citing an alleged omission on her asset declaration form. That same year, the government accused her of being involved in an alleged plot to kill Maduro, who succeeded Ch\u00e1vez after his 2013 death.",
      "Machado, a free-market firebrand, denied the charge, calling it an attempt to silence her and opposition members who had called tens of thousands of people to the streets in anti-government protests that at times turned violent.",

      "She kept a low profile for the next nine years, supporting some anti-Maduro initiatives and election boycotts and criticizing opposition efforts to negotiate with the government. By the time she announced a new bid for the presidency in 2023, her careful messaging had softened her image as an elitist hard-liner, allowing her to connect with skeptics on both sides.",
      "She won the opposition's presidential primary with more than 90% of the vote, unifying the faction \u2014 as noted by the Nobel Prize committee. But ruling-party loyalists who control the country\u2019s judiciary kept her from appearing on the ballot, which forced her to throw her support behind former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "She hiked overpasses, walked highways, rode motorcycles, sought shelter in supporters\u2019 homes and saw her closest collaborators be arrested as she kept campaigning across Venezuela. She repeatedly joined thousands of supporters chanting in unison \u201cFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d in rallies and asked them to vote for Gonz\u00e1lez, a virtual unknown who had never run for office before.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers. Still, Venezuela's National Electoral Council, loyal to the ruling party, declared Maduro the winner of the July 28, 2024, contest.",
      "People protested the results across the country, and the government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 people and accusing them of plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos. Most were released over the following months, but the government simultaneously arrested dozens of people who actively participated in Machado\u2019s efforts last year.",
      "Some of Machado's closest collaborators, including her campaign manager, avoided prison by sheltering for more than a year at a diplomatic compound in Caracas, where they remained until May, when they fled to the U.S.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez went into exile in Spain after he became the subject of an arrest warrant, and Machado has not been seen in public since January, when she joined people protesting Maduro's planned swearing-in ceremony. Her and Gonz\u00e1lez's inability to stop Maduro from taking the oath of office again led to a decline in support.",
      "People's trust has only shrunk since then, primarily over Machado's unquestionable support for Trump, including the large U.S. maritime deployment in the Caribbean that has carried out deadly strikes off the coast of Venezuela. This has led to fresh divisions within the opposition.",

      "The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and \u201cin response to market dynamics,\" Phillips 66 said.",
      "The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance.

      "Although many Syrians initially hoped for stability after Assad was ousted, sectarian killings against members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect in Syria\u2019s coastal region in March and against the Druze minority in the southern province of Sweida in July claimed hundreds of lives and revived security concerns.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanon-Syria border has long been a flashpoint for clashes, with periodic exchanges of fire and infiltration attempts, particularly in the northeastern Bekaa Valley. In March 2025, the two countries signed an agreement to demarcate the border and enhance security coordination, aiming to prevent disputes and curb smuggling and other illicit activities.",
      "Hezbollah has been heavily involved in cross-border smuggling, primarily to move weapons and military supplies, leading to tensions and violent confrontations along the border. Syrian security forces have repeatedly intercepted Hezbollah-linked trucks carrying weapons into Lebanon.",
      "Since the fall of Assad, two Lebanese prime ministers have visited Syria. Aoun and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa also held talks on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Egypt in March.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 The head of Japan's Komeito says it is leaving the ruling coalition headed by the Liberal Democratic Party due to concerns over corruption, in a major setback for the woman who hopes to become the country's next prime minister.",
      "The decision announced Friday by Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito deals a serious blow to the Liberal Democrats, who last weekend chose Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative lawmaker, as its leader.",
      "Takaichi could still become Japan's first female prime minister, but the departure of the Buddhist-backed Komeito will compel the Liberal Democrats to find at least one other coalition partner in order to stay in power.",
      "Speaking to reporters, she said Saito had \u201cone-sidedly announced the decision to leave the coalition\u201d even though she and her deputy, LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki, had said the Liberal Democrats would discuss the issues he raised and respond promptly.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister on Friday to break a political deadlock",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 After a week of intense political turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister Friday in his latest bid to break the political deadlock that has gripped the country for more than a year, as France struggles with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as the president\u2019s last chance to revive his second term, which runs until 2027. With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces increasingly fierce criticism, even from within his own camp, and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.",
      "Over the past year, Macron\u2019s successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France\u2019s poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",

      "In any case, the new prime minister will have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon the pension reform that gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Macron fought fiercely for the deeply unpopular measure, which was enacted into law in 2023 despite mass protests.",
      "Lecornu argued that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still rally to form a working majority. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority that can govern,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\u201d",
      "The stalemate stems from Macron\u2019s shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France\u2019s spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron\u2019s governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu\u2019s resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president\u2019s coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.",

      "The speech will come more than a week after protesters sent a letter of demands sent directly to the palace, thrusting the king into the spotlight and upending the careful distance he usually maintains from public debate. It called for the dismissal of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and his government, the release of political detainees, and the creation of a forum to hold corrupt politicians accountable.",

      "A family that runs two costume stores in Chicago is putting a creative twist on Halloween this year due to tariffs on Chinese imports",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 With Halloween on the horizon, Chicago Costume is stuffed. Packaged costumes, including superheros and Japanese animation characters in both kid and adult sizes, dangle near colorful wigs and bottles of fake blood. Downstairs, vintage clothes from the 1970s beg for one more boogie night.",
      "The frightening possibilities mask the work that\u2019s gone on behind the scenes to stock the family-owned shop and its sister store for the spooky season. Owner Courtland Hickey said he ordered 40% fewer costumes this year because of President Donald Trump's tariffs on products from China.",
      "To fill the gap, Hickey and his mother, Chicago Costume founder Mary Hickey Panayotou, looked to their decade's worth of unsold costumes and accessories to see what could be repackaged or repurposed. The tariffs made new imports more expensive, and storewide price increases might spook customers, he said.",
      "\u201cIf people have less money in their pocket to spend, ... then costumes are going to be lower on their list,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cSo the more we have to invest in new products, the riskier it is for the business because we aren\u2019t going to sell it.\u201d",
      "Tapping the old inventory required sorting through several thousand items stored in backrooms and a warehouse. Vintage pieces once reserved for rentals combined with fresh items became sets. A surplus of black robes became the foundation for Halloween wizards, judges, choir members and graduating students, Hickey said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a staple piece that gets transformed by the accessories we pair with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of Chicago Costume's 35 employees also got busy sewing fabric scraps and foam material into imitations of the miter headdresses worn by high-ranking Catholic clergy. Paired with a robe, the headwear would let someone dress up as Pope Leo, a Chicago native.",
      "Panayotou founded Chicago Costume in 1976 by custom-designing and renting costumes for the Windy City\u2019s theater companies. It fast became a destination for non-actors looking for Halloween outfits.",
      "Commercially made children\u2019s costumes followed, and a stockpile of capes, masquerade masks, \u201cStar Wars\u201d kits and other leftovers grew from there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of a hoarder,\u201d Panayotou said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to throw stuff away. So there\u2019s a lot of accessory items and pieces. Here\u2019s the dress, but we have only one glove.\u201d",
      "Having excess inventory typically is avoided in retail, but the practice has given Chicago Costume a supply cushion during what has been an unpredictable 2025 for import-reliant segments of the industry, including toy manufacturers and stores.",
      "Hickey said tariffs weren't on his radar until he and and other Chicago Costume staff members met with suppliers at the Halloween & Party Expo in January. Whether Trump would impose duties on Chinese goods after his inauguration the following week was a big topic of conversation at the Las Vegas event, he said.",
      "On Feb. 1, the president signed the first tariff order of his second term. Hickey already had ordered his usual number of new costumes but put fulfillment and delivery on hold when the tariff rate on imports from China ballooned to 145% in April. Nearly 90% of the costumes Chicago Costume sells in stores and online are made in China, in line with the costume industry average, he said.",
      "Some suppliers already had products ready and said they would not charge him extra, Hickey said. Others said he would have to pay more to cover the cost of tariffs. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d he recalls being told. \u201cI pretty much left it.\u201d",
      "Other small businesses that rely on Halloween describe similar their own tariff-related woes. Trick or Treat Studios, which designs masks based on characters from popular horror movies as well as costumes and props, laid off 15 employees, one-fourth of its staff, in May, co-founder Christopher Zephro said.",
      "Zephro uses factories in China to make plastic masks but said he is reducing the amount of work done there and shifting it to Mexico, where his latex masks are manufactured. In the meantime, he raised prices by 15%.",

      "At Chicago Costume, which generates well under $1 million dollars in annual sales, shoppers will see fewer sales promotions and discounts, Hickey said. Children\u2019s costumes of officially licensed characters and bulky sets will cost at least 25% more, he said. A lederhosen costume, for example, is priced at $49.99, or $10 more that it did a year ago.",
      "Hickey, who has served on the board of the National Costumers Association for 20 years, initially saw a silver lining in Trump's tariffs. Big retail chains have siphoned sales from independent costume shops with the help of cheap costumes from China, he said.",
      "In May, Hickey published a column on the National Costumers Association's website that outlined Chicago Costume's can-do, environmentally superior approach this year. He hoped it would galvanize the trade group's 100 independent store members \u2014 a group that numbered 220 a decade ago \u2014 to dust off old stock, reorganize their shops and prepare for \u201ca potentially great Halloween.\u201d",

In fact, I see it as a chance for us to reclaim what made local retail special.\"",
      "Some of Hickey's idealism has since faded. The impact of tariffs on Halloween played out differently than he expected. The largest retail chains doubled down, flooding the market with cheap costumes and dropping prices to hold onto customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot harder than I hoped, but I still believe that optimism, adaptability, and differentiation are what will keep independent costume shops like us alive,\u201d he said.",

Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",
      "Prince Harry has previously stressed the need to hold powerful social media companies accountable. He warned last year that young people are experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression and social isolation driven by negative experiences online.",
      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",

      "Senate Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining and drilling in federal land in three Western states",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump's ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.",
      "Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.",
      "The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president\u2019s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.",
      "The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.",
      "Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.",
      "The road was approved in Trump\u2019s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.",
      "The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.",
      "Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.",
      "A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.",
      "Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive \u201cstronger participation\u201d in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a \u201cdecades long war on coal\u201d by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was \u201cputting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.\u201d",

      "The GOP legislation \u201crestores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,\u201d Sullivan said in a statement.",

      "PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad -- PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) \u2014 The U.S. has granted Trinidad and Tobago permission to negotiate a gas deal with neighboring Venezuela without facing any U.S. sanctions, the Caribbean nation\u2019s attorney general said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department granted an Office of Foreign Assets Control license on Wednesday that allows parties to engage in a transaction that would otherwise be prohibited, according to the agency.",
      "With Venezuela hit by U.S. sanctions, Trinidad and Tobago needed the license to pursue the development of a gas field located in Venezuelan waters. The license was granted following a request that Trinidad and Tobago made in May, according to Attorney General John Jeremie.",
      "\u201cWe have six months to negotiate, within parameters,\u201d Jeremie said at a news conference. \u201cYou have to hit targets, with respect to the U.S. and their posture with Venezuela.\u201d",
      "He said U.S. companies have certain commercial targets. He declined to provide further details, but said those targets are reasonable and \"not difficult\u201d to meet.",
      "Government officials and experts view the gas project as vital since Trinidad and Tobago is seeking to boost its gas production. New streams of revenue are being sought by the government since its budget in recent years has seen spending outpace income.",
      "Jeremie said the license does not cover the entire gas project but allows for initial negotiations. He declined to give details about the license\u2019s commercial terms, saying only that certain benefits are permitted. Once the first stage is successfully completed, Jeremie said the process would move toward exploiting gas.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to prevent the state\u2019s plan that provides insurance to homeowners who can\u2019t get private coverage from running out of money",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.",
      "The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can\u2019t get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage.",
      "But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.",
      "That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.",
      "The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.",
      "\u201cThe kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking action now to continue strengthening California\u2019s insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Republican state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil said the measure was a good step to help stabilize the FAIR Plan.",

      "\u201cThis bill doesn't solve everything. But it does help to ensure that the FAIR Plan customers can rely on coverage in their time of greatest need,\u201d she said in September during a floor debate.",
      "Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board.",
      "Supporters, including the state\u2019s top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.",
      "California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.",
      "Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",

      "Jeeno Thitikul has claimed victory at the LPGA Shanghai, becoming the first two-time LPGA tournament winner of the season",
      "SHANGHAI -- SHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Jeeno Thitikul came from four shots down with five holes to play to force a playoff with Minami Katsu, before producing another extraordinary shot on the fifth playoff hole to claim the LPGA Shanghai and become the first two-time LPGA tournament winner of the season on Sunday.",
      "Top-ranked Thitikul's 63 was the round of the day and included seven birdies and an eagle. The Thai player's 24-under 264 closed what had appeared to be a comfortable margin for overnight leader Katsu of Japan, who had started the day two shots ahead and extended that to four after the 13th.",
      "But the Thai player reeled that in with birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th, before an incredible eagle with the ball bouncing along the mottled 17th green of Qizhong Garden Golf Club in Shanghai to draw level.",
      "Katsu (65) could only respond with a birdie of her own at the 17th, but had another birdie chance on the final hole to claw back the victory only for the ball to slide past the hole and forcing the playoff.",
      "Pars through the first four playoff holes, rotated between the 18th and the 10th, included Katsu having two birdie putts to win only to narrowly miss the hole on both.",
      "On the fifth playoff hole the deadlock was broken as a brilliant approach by Thitikul placed the ball three feet away, while Katsu's second shot fell short of the green at the par-4 18th.",
      "Katsu's chip for birdie was impressive but missed, leaving Thitikul a simple birdie putt to close out a remarkable victory nearly two years after losing in an epic nine-hole playoff to Celine Boutier at the LPGA Malaysia.",
      "It was Thitikul's second win of the season after claiming the Mizuho Americas Open in May and helped ease the disappointment of her inexplicable four-putt meltdown on the final hole at the Kroger Queen City Championship last month.",
      "\u201cWhat happened on the last event (was) definitely still in my mind, but like to be able to prove myself again this tournament, which is ... like a dream come true and you know, I\u2019m not carrying a thing on my shoulder,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d Misiorowski said during the Brewers\u2019 clubhouse celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I\u2019ve worked for, and it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Their arrivals in Milwaukee were indirectly connected.",
      "When Misiorowski was promoted from the minor leagues in June, he took Aaron Civale\u2019s spot in Milwaukee\u2019s rotation. Civale reacted to the bullpen assignment by saying he wouldn\u2019t mind getting traded to a team that would allow him to continue starting.",
      "The Brewers then sent Civale to the Chicago White Sox in a deal that brought them Vaughn. Civale ended up finishing the season with the Cubs, and he pitched 4 1/3 shutout innings in this series.",
      "At the time of the trade, there was little reason to believe Vaughn would become a major factor for Milwaukee this season. He had batted .189 with a .218 on-base percentage and .314 slugging percentage in 48 games with the White Sox, who eventually sent him to the minor leagues. The Brewers initially kept him in the minors after acquiring him.",
      "But he got called back up to the majors July 7 after Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins went on the injured list with a sprained left thumb. Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy greeted Vaughn by letting him know he would probably get sent right back to the minors if he continued chasing pitches outside the strike zone.",
      "Vaughn homered off Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto in his first at-bat with the Brewers and improved his chase rate in making a remarkable transformation. He batted .308 with a .375 on-base percentage and .493 slugging percentage in 64 games with Milwaukee.",
      "\u201cThis guy\u2019s a gamer,\u201d Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold said. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot, and he\u2019s failed, just like all of us. We\u2019ve all failed in this sport. If you haven\u2019t, you haven\u2019t been doing it long enough. So we\u2019ve all failed. For that guy to come in here and be himself and put the team on his back at times this year is really awesome.\u201d",
      "Vaughn offered simple reasons for his dramatic improvement.",
      "\u201cChange of scenery, being around some different coaches, different stuff and just playing free,\u201d he said.",
      "Vaughn put the Brewers ahead Saturday by connecting on a 3-2 pitch from Colin Rea and hitting a 383-foot drive over the left-field wall with two outs in the fourth. That cleared the way for Misiorowski to earn the Game 5 win.",

      "Then the rookie went on the injured lift with a left tibia bruise. He returned in mid-August but allowed 22 runs over 32 2/3 innings the rest of the season, a slump that led to concern about how much the Brewers could trust the excitable right-hander in a postseason setting.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t easy on him,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to pump him up. I wanted to find out what he had, because I knew with that kind of stuff, he could really help us.\u201d",

Misiorowski entered in the second inning of Game 5 and immediately gave up a tying homer to Seiya Suzuki, but the 23-year-old silenced the Cubs from there.",

      "Here are this year's winners so far:",
      "On Oct. 6, the Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded to three scientists for their work on the immune system.",
      "Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, viewed as critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",
      "In separate projects, the trio identified the importance of what are now called regulatory T cells. Scientists are using those findings in a variety of ways: to discover better treatments for autoimmune diseases, to improve organ transplant success and to enhance the body\u2019s own fight against cancer, among others.",
      "Bronkow, 64, is now a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for San Francisco-based Sonoma Biotherapeutics.

      "On Oct. 7, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to another trio of scientists for their research on the \u201cweirdness\u201d of subatomic particles called quantum tunneling. That has enabled the ultrasensitive measurements achieved by MRI machines and laid the groundwork for better cellphones and faster computers.",

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction and more than half of bird species around the world are declining",
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\u201cEvery time one is done and every time there\u2019s revision, there\u2019s more information, and there\u2019s more ability to answer questions\u201d on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \u201cdepressing litany of threats\u201d to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\u201cThe fact that 61% of the world\u2019s birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can\u2019t afford to ignore,\u201d Butchart said.",

      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it\u2019s important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\u201d said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.",
      "The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \u201csummon\u201d technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

      "Meteorologists say La Nina has arrived, bringing cooler weather patterns worldwide",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\u201d Slater said. \u201cNobody really knows where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d",
      "Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power these AI products.",
      "OpenAI doesn't turn a profit but the privately held San Francisco firm is now the world's most valuable startup, with a market valuation of $500 billion. It recently signed major deals with chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded company, and its rival AMD.",
      "The Bank of England didn't name any specific companies but said that on \u201ca number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report said stock market valuations are \u201ccomparable to the peak\u201d of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which then deflated and led to a recession. With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "AP reporters were later able to speak with Martinis, once his wife decided it was late enough to wake him up.",
      "Devoret could not immediately be contacted.",
      "The prize winning research in the mid-1980s took the sub-atomic \u201cweirdness of quantum mechanics\u201d and found how those tiny interactions can have real world applications on the human scale level, said Jonathan Bagger, CEO of the American Physical Society. They have the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on-and-off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers.",

      "The work is a crucial building block in the fast-developing world of quantum mechanics.",
      "\u201cQuantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they\u2019re also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\u201d Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "Quantum computing when fully achieved would be a large leap from what we now know, scientists said.",

      "Both Bagger and Fitzgerald said it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say our everyday cellphones now use the breakthrough made by Clarke and colleagues. But ultra-sensitive measuring devices rely on that team\u2019s work and while we could have magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) without their work, it makes it far more sensitive and useful, Bagger said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I told Mary she won, she said, \u2018don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u2019\u201d said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice surprise,\u201d Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \u201cI hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\u201d",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",
      "\u201cFrom a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. Yet you wouldn't know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: \u201cGrocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.\u201d",
      "And at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: \u201cInflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.\u201d",
      "Yet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed's target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.",
      "The Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration's tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong \u2014 if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected \u2014 the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.",
      "That credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won't take steps \u2014 such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise \u2014 that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.",
      "But Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.",
      "\u201cIf that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts -- and I do expect several more -- are going to be seen as a mistake,\u201d Dynan said.",
      "So far, the Trump administration's tariffs haven't lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "Tariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.",
      "The cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.",
      "Most Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried about the risk of worsening unemployment than about higher inflation.",

      "\u201cIt is a big gamble after what we\u2019ve been going through ... to count on it being transitory,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cOnce upon a time, (3% inflation) would have been considered really high.\u201d",
      "Just two weeks ago, Trump slapped new tariffs on a range of products, including 100% on pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. On Friday, he threatened \u201ca massive increase of tariffs\u201d on imports from China in response to that country's restrictions on rare earth exports.",
      "Some companies are still raising prices to offset the tariff costs. Duties on steel and aluminum imports have pushed up the cost of the cans used by Campbell Soups, leading the company\u2019s CEO to say in September that it will implement \u201csurgical pricing initiatives.\"",
      "Chris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, the nation\u2019s largest artificial Christmas tree seller, says his company will raise prices by about 10% this holiday season on its trees, wreaths, and garlands to offset tariff costs. About 45% of its trees are made in China, with the rest from Southeast Asia, Mexico, and other countries. The cost of labor and real estate is too high to make them in the United States, he said.",
      "Butler also expects there will be a reduced supply of artificial trees and decorations this year, which could lift industry-wide prices further, because most production in China shut down when tariffs on that country hit 145% earlier this year. Production resumed after Trump reduced the duties to 30% but at a slower pace.",
      "Butler has pushed his suppliers to absorb some of the cost of the tariffs, but they won\u2019t pay all of it.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it and our factories can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to pass along some of the increases to consumers.\u201d",
      "Many Fed policymakers are aware of the risks. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who votes on interest rate decisions, said Monday that high inflation that results from a loss of confidence in the central bank is harder to fight than other price spikes, such as those that result from supply disruptions.",
      "\u201cThe Fed must maintain its credibility on inflation,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cHistory has shown that while all inflations are universally disliked, not all inflations are equally costly to fight.\u201d",
      "Yet some Fed officials say that other trends are offsetting the impact of tariffs. Fed governor Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed just before the central bank\u2019s September meeting, said Tuesday that a steady slowdown in rental costs should reduce underlying inflation in the coming months. And the sharp drop in immigration as a result of the administration\u2019s clampdown will reduce demand, he said, cooling inflation pressures.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more sanguine about the inflation outlook than a lot of other people are,\u201d he said.",

      "The indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud has raised alarms among her allies and Black leaders, who condemned it as a politicization of the justice system for President Donald Trump's personal grievances",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The coalition of New York NAACP chapters had just begun its annual state convention when Letitia James, a longtime member and the state's attorney general, canceled her appearance.",
      "James had just been indicted by the Justice Department for alleged mortgage fraud, a charge which she called \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201ca grave violation of our constitutional order.\u201d",
      "For the New York convention's organizers, the moment was alarming and underscored the gathering's importance, which featured multiple sessions on building political power at the state level in response to what NAACP leaders called federal attacks on social welfare, civil rights and the rule of law.",
      "\u201cIt was through our collective action that a democracy was built,\u201d said NAACP New York State Conference President L. Joy Williams. \u201cWhat we have to do is not only defend against what is happening now, but we have to push further past where we were before, to build a system to build a better American democracy that we all deserve.\u201d",
      "The indictment of James, who had previously prosecuted the Trump Organization for business fraud, immediately sparked debate over whether the justice system had been politicized for President Donald Trump's personal grievances. It also drew many parallels with the recent effort by Trump to remove a Federal Reserve Board governor, Lisa Cook, from her post over similar allegations.",
      "Advocates see some of Trump's recent moves as exceptionally targeted at Black women leaders.",
      "\u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been grappling with since the start of this administration,\u201d said Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women, the country\u2019s oldest civil rights organization for Black women.",
      "The claims also have symbolic weight to Black families, Arline-Bradley said, where property ownership has historically been restricted by the legal system through outright and implicit discrimination.",
      "Homeownership has since become a disproportionate \u2014 and sometimes sole \u2014 avenue of wealth creation for Black Americans. And a recent national survey shows a widening of the racial wealth gap between white and Black individuals, even as income has increased for Black workers.",
      "\u201cWhen you attack someone\u2019s home, you attack their ability to own, you attack their ability to have choice, you have attacked their ability to make a statement about their economic future,\u201d Arline-Bradley said. \u201cThis is a consistent pattern that has highlighted what they think is an Achilles' heel in the Black community.\u201d",
      "Black women, Arline-Bradley added, \u201cfeel very targeted\u201d because of the president\u2019s words and actions, which she said was rooted in \u201ca misunderstanding about the accomplishments and leadership of these women.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Former first lady Michelle Obama is putting new force behind efforts to ensure girls overcome educational barriers in some of the world's most economically disadvantaged areas.",
      "The Obama Foundation's Girls Opportunity Alliance pledged Saturday to rally $2.5 million for dozens of grassroots groups who advance adolescent girls' education by covering school-related costs, challenging patriarchal practices such as child marriage, counseling survivors of sexual abuse and providing other forms of support.",
      "\u201cThese groups are changing the way girls see themselves in their own communities and in our world, helping create the leaders we need for the brighter future we all deserve,\" Obama said in a video released Oct. 11, the International Day of the Girl. \"Because when our girls succeed, we all do.\u201d",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the 119 million girls out of school worldwide are of secondary school-age, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Girls Opportunity Alliance \u2014 an outgrowth of an Obama White House initiative that invested $1 billion in U.S. government programs promoting adolescent girls' education abroad \u2014 launched in 2018 with a focus on helping that population between ages 10-19 graduate.",
      "But the latest announcement comes amid stark warnings from international aid groups that budget cuts will roll back recent progress. UNICEF projects that a 24% drop in wealthy countries' global education funding will push six million girls out of school by the end of next year.",
      "\u201cThe need right now, I think more than ever, is crucial,\" Girls Opportunity Alliance Executive Director Tiffany Drake said. \"We were just in Mauritius and we heard it time and time again that organizations need funding. They need support.\u201d",
      "Girls Opportunity Alliance's early October convening in Mauritius brought together Asian and African members of its network. The great demands on local leaders doing tireless work with little resources made it, in Drake's view, perhaps the most moving gathering they've hosted.",
      "But Jackie Bomboma, the founder of Young Strong Mothers Foundation in Tanzania, said connecting with other powerful women there left her encouraged with the knowledge that she's not alone. A recipient of GOA's latest grants, she said the Obama Foundation's endorsement not only brings financial support, but increased trust from the international community and additional channels to get resources.",
      "Growing up without a mother and having survived teenage pregnancy, Bomboma said Obama's example has also instilled confidence in her and the girls she serves. Her nonprofit provides psychological services, vocational training, entrepreneurship skills development and sexual health lessons to hundreds of girls at risk of child marriage, teenage pregnancy and school dropout.",
      "\u201cWe call ourselves \u2018watoto wa Michelle Obama,\u2019 which means \u2018the children of Michelle Obama,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo, everyone feels so proud to have such a mother who is very strong, who is very powerful and who is very loving.\u201d",
      "The Girls Opportunity Alliance fund is intentionally designed to provide a range of support. Drake said anyone can apply for up to $50,000. The grant does not support general operations but instead goes toward a specific project outlined by the recipient.",

      "Five days later, a tip from a McDonald\u2019s about 233 miles (375 kilometers) away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since then.",

      "The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime \u2014 stalking \u2014 is not a crime of violence.",

      "A family cleaning their backyard in New Orleans discovered an unusual marble tablet with some characters in Latin",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A New Orleans family cleaning up their overgrown backyard made an extremely unusual find: Under the weeds was a mysterious marble tablet with Latin characters that included the phrase \u201cspirits of the dead.\"",
      "\u201cThe fact that it was in Latin that really just gave us pause, right?\u201d said Daniella Santoro, a Tulane University anthropologist. \u201cI mean, you see something like that and you say, \u2018Okay, this is not an ordinary thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Intrigued and slightly alarmed, Santoro reached out to her classical archaeologist colleague Susann Lusnia, who quickly realized that the slab was the 1,900-year-old grave marker of a Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the image that Daniella sent me, it really did send a shiver up my spine because I was just floored,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "Further sleuthing by Lusnia revealed the tablet had been missing from an Italian museum for decades.",
      "Sextus Congenius Verus had died at age 42, of unknown causes, after serving for more than two decades in the imperial navy on a ship named for the Roman god of medicine, Asclepius. The gravestone calls the sailor \u201cwell deserving\" and was commissioned by two people described as his \u201cheirs,\" who were likely shipmates since Roman military could not be married at the time, Lusnia said.",
      "The tablet had been in an ancient cemetery of around 20 graves of military personnel, found in the 1860s in Civitavecchia, a seaside in northwest Italy about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Rome. Its text had been recorded in 1910 and included in a catalog of Latin inscriptions, which noted the tablet\u2019s whereabouts were unknown.",
      "The tablet was later documented at the National Archeological Museum in Civitavecchia prior to World War II. But the museum had been \u201cpretty much destroyed\u201d during Allied bombing and took several decades to rebuild, Lusnia said. Museum staff confirmed to Lusnia the tablet had been missing for decades. Its recorded measurements \u2014 1 square foot (0.09 square meters) and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick \u2014 matched the size of the tablet found in Santoro\u2019s backyard.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have better DNA than that,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "She said the FBI is in talks with Italian authorities to repatriate the tablet. An FBI spokesperson said the agency could not respond to requests for comment during the government shutdown.",

      "DORAL, Fla. -- DORAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Venezuelans in \u201cLittle Venezuela\u201d \u2014 the largest home for the country's natives in the United States \u2014 are welcoming the news that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize with bittersweetness as deportation threats loom.",
      "The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole programs that together allowed more than 700,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the U.S, putting them at risk of deportation. The Republican government has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, claiming that they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and were \u201cinvading\u201d the U.S.",
      "Millions of Venezuelans had been forced to leave their country in the last decade due to its prolonged economic and political instability; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates more than 7.7 million have left since 2014 in the largest exodus in Latin America in recent history. Most have settled in the Americas, and more than 1 million came to the U.S.",
      "While Machado's Nobel win is being met with joy, there's also acknowledgement that it will do little to improve the situation Venezuelans at risk of deportation face in the U.S., as the former opposition presidential candidate has aligned herself with President Donald Trump\u2019s policy on Venezuela.",
      "In February, after Trump announced he was ending TPS for Venezuelans, Machado told reporters her team had been in contact with members of Congress to \u201cfind a type of effective protection\u201d for law-abiding Venezuelans. But after the Supreme Court on Oct. 3 allowed the Trump administration to end the program, she expressed no concerns of progress in her effort for an alternative protection for migrants.",
      "Machado, honored for her struggle to achieve a democratic transition in Venezuela as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro took power, wrote on X hours after her win dedicating her prize to \u201cthe suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!\u201d",
      "Frank Carre\u00f1o, the former president of the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce who has lived in Doral, the city known as \u201cLittle Venezuela,\u201d for 18 years, was pleased with the news that Machado won the Nobel Prize but warned that Machado will not pressure Trump to protect Venezuelans living in the U.S.",
      "\u201cShe sees the United States government as part of her strategy to restore democracy to Venezuela,\u201d the Venezuelan American said. \u201cShe\u2019s in that camp, not in this camp.\u201d",

      "In sworn affidavits included with the filing, two jurors said they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by jurors who wanted to convict Weinstein on the charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One juror said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \"I would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",
      "Weinstein, 73, was acquitted on a second criminal sex act charge involving a different woman, Polish psychotherapist and former model Kaja Sokola. The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "It was the second time the Oscar-winning producer was tried on some of the charges. His 2020 conviction, a watershed moment for the # MeToo movement, was overturned last year. Now his defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, is fighting to eliminate his retrial conviction and head off another retrial on the undecided count.",

      "After the trial, two jurors disputed the foreperson\u2019s account. One said no one mistreated him. The other said deliberations were contentious, but respectful.",

      "Officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs WIC, told congressional staffers they were using $300 million in unspent tariff revenue from the last fiscal year to keep the program afloat, two people briefed on the call told AP. The people declined to be named because they were not authorized to share details from the call.",
      "Tariff revenue supports many USDA programs. The law permits the administration to transfer money allocated for other programs to WIC.",
      "Without the additional money, state and local governments would have had to step in to pay for their WIC programs and later seek reimbursement from the federal government when funding was restored. Washington state, which is dealing with a massive budget shortfall, said it could not afford to use state money for the WIC program.",
      "In Alaska, the WIC program only had enough federal money to operate through Saturday, meaning the state would have had to step in with its own funding to keep the program running. But this week, officials learned they were receiving nearly $900,000, enough to fully fund the program through Nov. 8, according to Shirley Sakaye, a spokesperson with the state\u2019s health department. About half a million of that came from leftover funds from other programs, she said.",
      "The government has been shut down since Oct. 1, after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to pass a bill to continue funding the government. Congressional Democrats want to reverse cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump's mega-bill. They also want to extend subsidies that cut the cost of Affordable Care Act insurance plans, which cover more than 24 million Americans.",

    "summary": "After 14 years playing NYPD detective Danny Reagan on \"Blue Bloods,\" Donnie Wahlberg now stars in the spinoff series \"Boston Blue,\" patrolling the streets of his own hometown.",
    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Bear\" talks about how he approached playing legendary rocker Bruce Springsteen in a new film, and what he found in common with him.",
    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The latest white-knuckle thriller by director Kathryn Bigelow imagines the responses within the government and the military when a single ICBM is launched toward the United States.",
    "story": [
      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

    "summary": "The owners and operators of independent cinemas are working to adapt as audience habits change.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

      "The lawsuit also alleged that the track tarnished his reputation and decreased the value of his brand.",
      "Lamar was not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Universal Music Group, the parent record label for both artists, had denied the allegations.",
      "\"From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,\" a UMG spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Thursday. \"We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Drake told CBS News in a statement, \"We intend to appeal today's ruling, and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it.\"",
      "CBS News has also reached out to representatives for Lamar for comment.",
      "UMG owns both Interscope, Lamar's label, and Republic Records, where Drake has spent his entire career.",
      "In February, Drake reached a settlement with iHeartMedia in a separate court complaint filed in Texas over \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "In that complaint, Drake alleged that iHeartMedia had received illegal payments from UMG to boost radio airplay for \"Not Like Us.\" iHeartMedia and UMG denied the allegations.",
      "And in November 2024, Drake also filed a similar complaint in New York against streaming giant Spotify and UMG, accusing them of conspiring to inflate streams of \"Not Like Us.\" Both companies have also denied those claims.",
      "Lamar and Drake have been beefing for years, with the two rappers releasing several diss tracks about one another. The feud appeared to reach its height when Lamar called out Drake during his Super Bowl Halftime Show in February.",
      "In \"Not Like Us,\" which was released in May 2024, Lamar makes disturbing accusations about Drake allegedly having inappropriate conduct with minors. He also makes similar allegations about Drake's friends and continues to question Drake's talent.",
      "In his own responding diss track, Drake denied these allegations, as well as allegations about having a daughter."

    "story": [
      "Jennifer Lopez says her latest project, a musical film exploring an unlikely bond between a transgender character and a political revolutionary, arrives at a moment when a message of acceptance is necessary.",
      "\"I think it's necessary because the world is in a place where there's a lot of hate ... there's a demonization of like the Latino community, of the queer community....and I think, you know, we need to remind each other that love is the answer - not hate,\" Lopez told \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King about the new film, \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" which hits theaters Friday.",
      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",
      "The story's central message focuses on a transgender character and a cisgender political revolutionary who come from completely different worlds but, through extraordinary circumstances, come to recognize each other's humanity and develop a deep bond.",
      "\"I thought to myself: this is something I've wanted to do my whole life,\" she said.",
      "Playing three \"very different characters\"",
      "Lopez said the last time she felt that same thrill was when she was preparing for her star role in \"Selena.\" In \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" Lopez plays three different versions of the same woman.",
      "\"They're the same person, but they're three very different iterations of this woman and they're all very different characters and they have very different looks as well. And that was fun. But I think the essence of who they were was very different, but still the same. And I think that was the challenge,\" Lopez explained.",
      "Lopez said the film's core message is about seeing past differences.",
      "\"When you forget about all those things, if you forget about somebody's political views and you forget, we're all entitled to our opinions about everything and our ways of thinking, and even, you know, from where we grew up and where we're from all over the world. But the truth is, we're all human, we're all the same. And if we can just see that we can allow people to be who they are and love each other anyway,\" she said.",
      "She also spoke about her character, Ingrid Luna, who appears in one musical sequence. In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance. The number, titled \"Where You Are,\" serves as an emotional moment of release, inviting the character to forget his surroundings and find comfort through imagination.",
      "\"And I think that's what art and music and movies...films do for people. You know, and especially in difficult times of their life, I know for me, it definitely has been that way,\" Lopez said.",
      "Bad Bunny and the power of music",
      "Lopez and Shakira headlined the Pepsi Super Bowl LIV halftime show, with a special guest performance from Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny during a rendition of \"I Like it.\"",
      "As\u00a0Bad Bunny now prepares to take the NFL's biggest stage\u00a0for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX halftime show, Lopez is sharing her appreciation for the artist as he encourages people to learn Spanish. She said the message behind his performance, much like her new film, centers on love and openness, encouraging people not to close themselves off to new experiences.",
      "\"Music and art transcends language. It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"And he's done that probably more than anybody of any generation he really has.\"",
      "Lopez said the Super Bowl gives artists a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and show who they are.",
      "\"It's about not having so many ideas and closing yourself off to experiences that you might be missing out on something wonderful. Don't do that to yourself. That's what I would say,\" she said.",
      "She praised a moment when Bad Bunny brought singer Marc Anthony, the father of Lopez's children, onstage during a concert in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"It couldn't have been a more perfect moment. And I didn't even see it. I know it was perfect-- God didn't let me see it, because I would've exploded. I would've died,\" Lopez said.",
      "For Lopez, it's always important to keep her mind and heart open, telling King she still considers herself a \"hopeful romantic\" - the term she told King she preferred over \"hopeless romantic\" in an interview in 2022.",
      "\"100%. 100%. And the more self aware I become with the lessons that I learn and the hardships that I go through, the more I feel whole and complete on my own, the more I become hopeful for that same type of person to come into my life,\" said Lopez. \"The more I know the more, you know, that type of person will come into my life. Yeah. And so I'm excited for everything in the future.\""

      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",

Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",

      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

    "summary": "Financial markets slumped Friday after President Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China over a dispute involving rare earths.",
    "story": [
      "Investors are shuddering on concerns of renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&P 500 shedding 183 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,553 in what was the index's worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%.",
      "The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.",
      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "\"They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat follows a move by China this week to implement tighter restrictions on the country's exports of rare earths, critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie. Access to such materials has been a key sticking point in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
      "The new export controls outlined by the country's Ministry of Commerce, which took effect on Thursday, require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths sourced from China, including if those products were manufactured abroad by non-Chinese companies.",
      "An English translation of the new rules released Thursday does not specify potential penalties if exporters fail to comply with the controls.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed surprise at the the new trade measures, describing the move by China's government as \"very hostile\" and vowing to retaliate if Beijing follows through in applying the rare-earth controls.",
      "\"One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said in his post. \"There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.\"",

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 624 points, or 1.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 600 points, or 2.6%.",
      "\"After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the U.S. and China, this step-up in tensions has created a white-knuckle moment for the markets, with tech stocks under major pressure today,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investstors.",
      "Financial markets, which pushed deeper into record territory earlier this week, have also edged down in recent days as some investors warn of a potential pubble in stocks propelled by the growth in artificial intelligence."

    "story": [
      "China has hit U.S.-owned vessels docking in the country with tit-for-tat port fees, in response to the American government's planned port fees on Chinese ships, expanding a string of retaliatory measures before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

      "One such example is a pair of headphones advertised by Amazon on Prime Day as being on sale for 44% off the product's list price of $179.95, according to the complaint. Plaintiffs claim that the item's list price has always been in the range of \"$130 to $160\" and that the advertised 44% discount was misleading.",
      "\"Amazon uses these fake Prime Day Percentage Discounts, offered under the extreme time pressure of the brief Prime Day window, to lure consumers to purchase products,\" the complaint states.",

However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",
      "That means the supposedly time-limited Prime Day Deal of $72.18 was actually higher than the tablet's $50 price Amazon was selling the item for in April, and about the same price the item usually goes for on Amazon, the lawsuit alleges.",

      "Earned Income Tax Credit",
      "The maximum amount for households that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit will be $8,231 for families with at least three children, up from $8,046 for the current tax year, the IRS said.",
      "Estate tax limit",
      "The estates of wealthy Americans will see a bigger tax break in 2026 than they did this year. The IRS said Thursday that the estates of people who die in 2026 will have a basic exclusion amount of $15 million, up from nearly $14 million in the 2025 tax year.",
      "Health Flexible Spending",
      "U.S. workers can now voluntarily contribute up to $3,400 to their health flexible spending accounts, up $100 from prior year. These contributions, which are deducted pre-tax from employee paychecks, go toward an account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is. Take the example of a married couple with $150,000 in gross income. They would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%.",
      "However, their effective tax rate \u2014 meaning the percentage of their annual income that they will pay to the IRS \u2014\u00a0is much lower, as follows:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

    "story": [
      "Senators have launched an inquiry into companies paid billions in taxpayer dollars to build eligibility systems for Medicaid, expressing concern that error-riddled technology and looming work requirements \"will cause Americans to lose Medicaid coverage to this bureaucratic maze.\"",
      "The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.",
      "As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company's responsibility to build functioning systems, \"rather than to prioritize their bottom line.\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.",
      "\"They're essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don't get health care,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.",
      "\"They've got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,\" Wyden said. \"Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.",
      "As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.",
      "A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.",
      "Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.",
      "States are in a \"major sprint\" to make changes by 2027, she said, and they're being \"inundated\" with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.",
      "\"I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,\" Serafi said.",
      "Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states' costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.",
      "The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems' failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual's eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,\" the senators wrote.",
      "The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies' contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company's lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.",
      "By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.",
      "The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.",
      "Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they've been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.",
      "Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they're working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state's Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia's eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.",
      "Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.",
      "The state's application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.",
      "Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees' work hours, training, and education. The state's eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.",
      "States are in the early stages of determining changes they need to make to implement work requirements.",
      "Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed \"through the existing contractual change order process.\" State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.",
      "In Missouri, upgrades are expected to cost roughly $33 million, according to a state budget document.",
      "The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri's Department of Social Services.",
      "Medicaid eligibility contractors \"have a lot of leverage and expertise to influence contracts, to win contracts,\" Wyden said. \"They can do a lot more, to the value of what we're giving them.\"",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla allegedly has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.",
      "CEO Elon Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not fixed such problems. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.",
      "Tesla shares fell 1.4% Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "story": [
      "Airports in U.S. cities including Denver; Newark, New Jersey; and Burbank, California, experienced flight delays Monday amid shortages of air traffic controllers, according to federal flight data.",
      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.",
      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",
      "According to CBS News Los Angeles, plane captains taking off from the Burbank airport were being asked to contact SoCal Approach, a San Diego-based company also known as Southern California TRACON, so they could communicate and get departure clearance.",
      "When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.",
      "\"Fragile\" aviation system",
      "On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank\u00a0according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.",
      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Near the end of a 34-day government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices."

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\""

    "summary": "Low-income older Americans on average die nearly a decade earlier than wealthier people, a new analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\""

    "summary": "Thirty paintings by Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to support public television stations after federal funding cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

    "story": [
      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",
      "As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now, here in studio, by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Thank you for being with us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just on this topic, I know you have a lot of differences with the President, but on this, is this a clear win?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a cease fire. It's important that these hostages are coming home, and I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's, there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully as these hostages are released. But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year. And it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today. So again, this will be a good week, but as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There is no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There is certainly a risk of hostilities beginning again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. My understanding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Yeah. I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu, and Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so, clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown. And when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, I listened to the Vice President, and he's just not living in reality. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 What do you mean? --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- The fact is, well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class. The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files. So JD Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations and raising premiums, raising health care costs by 75% on American citizens. So yes, I think that Democrats should say if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- That's the average, but in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here. But you did hear the Vice President say, when it came to health care, the administration is open to a discussion, we want to lower insurance premiums. That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance at an opening?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- They've been on an unprecedented five week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut and they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to the law. I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven week deal that we're talking about at this point, the short term funding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- Correct, the long term budget that we pass ultimately has to require that the president not engage in mass scale corruption. But a short term agreement, certainly is not going to fix all of the problems that exist right now in the way the President is running the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018, you were back in 2013 when it was a discussion over health care. This is what you said in 2018.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SEN. MURPHY: The future of the American health care system was a legitimate public policy issue, as is the security of our borders, but we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown, trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, that was a fight over, sort of, the long term structure of the American health care system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75% and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not--",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about health care, that there will be any follow through?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president, and the reason is because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking- we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system. We're simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases, by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Minority Leader gave an interview to Punchbowl this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview, he said, every day this goes on, every day gets better for us. The Speaker of the House said that was this callous statement.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, they're- they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying. Listen, our priority is the American people. And yes, it is true, as every day--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past, back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No. As every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are breaking with JD Vance and President Trump and saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the President's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point, there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed, their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed, by these enormous increases in health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but in the meantime, there's also the not- not getting a paycheck problem for some of these people.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Where's the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down and reopening the government, they would be in Washington rather than spread out all over the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Appreciate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Good to have you here. You are a House lawmaker in town, but I want to talk to you about your intelligence portfolio. The Financial Times is reporting, right now, that the United States is helping Ukraine to target Russian oil installations. In other words, hitting Russia right in that pocketbook. What can you say in regard to how the Trump administration is changing its policy? Are they truly now standing up to Vladimir Putin?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, not really, right. We've heard now for months that we're two weeks away. I think that's the President's terminology, used several times now over many months from really cracking down on Russia. And of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House, so it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it, have it both ways. Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20%. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again, without being specific, that I wish the President would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians, but he hasn't taken any meaningful step back- steps back from the Biden administration, so we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that, perhaps, he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military? Not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",
      "REP. HIMES:\u00a0 Well, again, I don't want to get- I don't want to get specific with respect to authorities, but, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric. There, I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pullback, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance to the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelensky and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable. Venezuela: There are close to- the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the Southern Command region of operations. There have been four US strikes on vessels. The US says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions, and you did it along with the Head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the US knows what is being done?",
      "REP. HIMES: I mean one of the many troubling aspects about these lethal attacks in the Caribbean against supposedly drug-dealing boats. Now, we don't know that, because, unlike our counterterrorism programs, the Congress is not being told who were on these boats, how they were identified, what the intelligence was, totally different thing. Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's okay, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not okay with me. I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here, because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that, based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States, and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers- Venezuelan drug dealers is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore --",
      "REP. HIMES: Doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action. So, their legal justifications are laughable and what- and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what amazes me about that is that the President, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the Secretary of Defense? What about the Deputy? What about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear legal authority? What about them? Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if, in the next couple of years, there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command, because it is not at all clear, well, it is getting increasingly clear, that these are that these are illegal killings. Setting aside the law for a second here. Margaret, you know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate military action, which it's not, because the Congress hasn't approved it, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation of the laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. Okay, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- are you saying that these were not lawful orders? That the military was- because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry. Our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military who were the trigger pullers did something else?",
      "REP. HIMES: I am saying that, to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get 1,000 different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that, at best, the legal authorities are questionable. So I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal. They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarized environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made. But, the worm turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968 we prosecuted, convicted of murder a lieutenant, Lieutenant Cawley, because he and his unit killed, probably, hundreds of people in My Lai and Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's okay. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But, I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state. We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank, to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no-interest loans to 45,000 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash-crunch for a lot of people. What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REP. HIMES: So, I mean, I will tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23 year olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the Vice President on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the house. So when the Vice President United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The President posts on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is- which is- which is pretty tentative to say the best. The Speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shutdown would require legislation. The Speaker of the House has taken that off the table. So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But, I don't see anything moving. The house is, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the house is on vacation. So no, I don't think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Speaker says that if the government wasn't shut down, the military be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But, no one's working right now, as you just said. We'll have to continue to track this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. We'll be back in a moment."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

The White House physician said Biden had a small skin lesion with cancerous tissue removed from his chest during his annual physical. Further testing confirmed it was basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer.",

      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",

      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",

      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",

      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

    "story": [
      "Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca will offer U.S. patients discounted prices for some prescription drugs, President Trump announced Friday, the second major drug company to strike a deal with the Trump administration in recent weeks.",
      "Under the deal, AstraZeneca will offer its drugs to Medicaid patients at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning the U.K.-based drugmaker will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a Friday afternoon Oval Office event. AstraZeneca also promised to offer new prescription drugs at most-favored-nation rates, Oz said.",
      "AstraZeneca will also list \"all primary care medications\" on a government website called TrumpRx, and it will offer discounts for some drugs, including lung disease medication, according to Oz. The company said in a statement that it will offer drugs at up to an 80% discount for \"eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases.\"",
      "TrumpRx \u2014 which is set to launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but will instead direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere, Oz said. AstraZeneca said the website will allow patients to buy drugs directly from the company at a \"reduced cash price.\"",
      "The AstraZeneca announcement came less than two weeks after Pfizer reached a similar deal to offer most-favored-nation rates to Medicaid patients and list drugs on TrumpRx.",
      "Policymakers have struggled with high prescription drug prices for decades. Members of both parties have floated proposals to tie drug prices to the typically much lower rates offered in other countries, but the idea faces legal impediments, and drugmakers have argued that price controls could make it harder for them to invest in research.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed some of the largest pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily offer drugs to Medicaid patients and new drugs at most-favored-nation rates, floating tighter regulations if companies do not comply. Separately, Mr. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless drugmakers are in the process of building U.S.-based plants. AstraZeneca on Friday announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research facilities.",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work, and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter, some experts caution.",
      "Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, told CBS News in reaction to the Pfizer deal.",
      "It's also unclear how many people would benefit from TrumpRx. For uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, such an option could matter, if their prescriptions are among those listed. But most people obtain their medications through insurance.",
      "\"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump,\" Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, told CBS News following the Pfizer agreement. \"Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced a finalized agreement that will allow the Qatari Emiri Air Force to build a facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho.",
      "The agreement, which Hegseth announced alongside Qatari Minister of Defense Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the Pentagon, will allow Qatari pilots to receive training alongside U.S. soldiers. There are no foreign military bases in the U.S., but some foreign militaries do maintain a presence for training. The Singaporean Air Force also has a presence at the Mountain Home base.",
      "Hegseth said he is \"proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.\"",
      "\"The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership,\" Hegseth said. \"And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.\"",
      "Later Friday, Hegseth clarified that Qatar would not have its own base in the U.S., writing on X: \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft. However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States-nor anything like a base. We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"",
      "The move is another demonstration of the Trump administration's increasingly close relationship with Qatar.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last month \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar,\" following Israel's decision to carry out a military strike in Qatar's capital city of Doha, where the vast majority of Qataris live. \"The United States shall regard any armed attack on the territory, sovereignty, or critical infrastructure of the State of Qatar as a threat to the peace and security of the United States,\" the executive order reads.",
      "Qatar also played a \"substantial\" role in the Israel-Hamas peace deal, as Hegseth said Friday and as other top administration officials have acknowledged.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to an accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jetliner from Qatar to use as a presidential plane also stirred up debate about ethical and national security-related concerns. When finished, the plane will be used as Air Force One."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:28:35 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE's John Schultz said he's \"confident\" that once the administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Maryland \u2014 A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.",
      "Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.",
      "Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who \"knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica.\" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, \"getting to the three strikes, you're out.\"",
      "The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of\u00a0human smuggling\u00a0plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.",
      "Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.",
      "Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.",
      "Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.",
      "The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.",
      "Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country \"is not accepting Abrego Garcia.\"",
      "\"He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,\" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. \"In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.\"",
      "Schultz said he is \"confident\" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted\u00a0the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take \"in the reasonably foreseeable future\" to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he\u00a0might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision\u00a0that found federal law does not permit \"indefinite detention\" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a \"period reasonably necessary\" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.",
      "After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a \"purported\" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the \"presumptively reasonable period\" of detention would've expired in 2020.",
      "Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in \"continuous confinement\" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained \u2014 with the exception of a brief weekend in August.",
      "The \"U.S. government held the keys\" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.",
      "Rossman said the administration is \"0 for 3\" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.",
      "The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him \"upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.\"",
      "Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is \"intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.\"",
      "\"They have spun the globe and picked various places,\" he said, to effectively \"fail on purpose\" by selecting countries that would be \"completely unpalatable\" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated \u2014 during which he would remain detained.",
      "\"That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,\" Rossman said.",
      "Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.",
      "\"Why hasn't there been?\" she said of discussions.",
      "Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland\u00a0rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been \"vindictive,\" writing on Friday that \"The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success.\" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.",
      "There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said."

She said that in the aftermath of the crash, flying will never be the same for her, and the government shutdown gave her pause when she came to Capitol Hill this week to advocate for safety reforms.",
      "\"I trust that everyone who is going to work is doing their very best to keep us safe, but this is just not a functional way to govern,\" she told CBS News. \"We deserve better than this. We deserve that our essential systems, our transportation systems, stay open and that the folks who are responsible for keeping those safe are paid on time and that that doesn't become a football.\"",
      "Amid efforts in Congress to reform the nation's aviation system, Feres and other victims' family members have been meeting with lawmakers and Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. Feres' cousin Peter Livingston, his wife Donna and daughters Alydia and Everly died when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Eagle flight over the Potomac River in January.",
      "\"Our message has been that aviation safety reform matters,\" Feres said. \"It matters to the American people. This is a nonpartisan issue. This is an American issue, and we all deserve to know that when we or our loved ones get on a plane, we get off again on the other side.\"",
      "Feres and other victims' family members met with Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state.",
      "\"I have a lot of confidence in the members on both sides of the aisle who are working hard to ensure that this stays a top priority, but I think anytime, obviously, the government is shut down, we know that infrastructure projects are delayed and we know that the members of the government who are on the job, who are TSA agents and air traffic controllers, may not be getting paid, and that's a concern for all of us.\"",
      "The NTSB's investigation into January's crash is ongoing.",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter was flying without a piece of equipment turned on that allows the aircraft to be tracked. The military has a waiver that essentially exempts it from having to use the equipment.",
      "In July, Cruz introduced legislation that would require all aircraft to use the equipment, known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast, or ADS-B.",
      "A spokesperson for Cruz said in a statement to CBS News that he's been working with the victims' families on the bill since January.",
      "\"The Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Reform Act represents an important step forward in aviation safety reform by requiring that all aircraft, military and civilian, use both ADS-B Out and ADS-B In and seeks to hold the Army accountable for failures that may have contributed to the crash,\" the spokesperson said. \"He is committed to ensuring another accident does not happen again.\""

      "\"They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat follows a move by China this week to implement tighter restrictions on the country's exports of rare earths, critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie. Access to such materials has been a key sticking point in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
      "The new export controls outlined by the country's Ministry of Commerce, which took effect on Thursday, require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths sourced from China, including if those products were manufactured abroad by non-Chinese companies.",
      "An English translation of the new rules released Thursday does not specify potential penalties if exporters fail to comply with the controls.",

      "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.",
      "Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the Israel-Hamas peace plan brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape.",
      "The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has called the deal the \"first phase\" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages.",
      "\"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war.",
      "\"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East,\" Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal \u2014 and that still isn't certain.",
      "\"That's not self-evident,\" Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.\"",
      "One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said.",
      "\"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?\" Rice asked. \"The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood.\"",
      "Clinton called Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September \"ill-advised\" and a \"strategic error\" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening.",
      "\"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'\"",
      "Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, \"They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.\"",
      "Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said.",
      "\"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East,\" Rice said. \"And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security.\"",
      "Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government \"has to cease.\"",
      "She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.",
      "\"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,\" Clinton said.",
      "The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year ordeal that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and nearly uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military.",
      "Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed \"technocratic\" committee that does not include Hamas and \u2014 at least for now \u2014 also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.",
      "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history \u2014 including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton pressed for a two-state solution\u00a0 \u2014 but Obama struggled with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace.",
      "But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now."

    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",

It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Richard Esposito, a former New York Police Department deputy commissioner said, \"it appears there may have been several procedural, operational, and investigative missteps at this crime scene.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, determining the true facts and circumstances in a death investigation-and transparently communicating those findings to the public-helps dispel misinformation and reduce the spread of conspiracy theories,\" said Esposito, who is a CBS News law enforcement contributor.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel, but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \""

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",

      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Nobel Prize committee chair says discoveries by the trio of researchers were \"decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions.\"",
    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",
      "The trio will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million)."

    "summary": "The first supermoon of 2025 will arrive soon. Here's what to know about the phenomenon.",
    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee."

      "\"This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,\" Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera, said in a statement. \"The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.\"",
      "Since its discovery in July, comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed several times. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency shared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which captured the comet from about 277 million miles away.",
      "Last month, a new image showed the growing tail of 3I/ATLAS from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "NASA has said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. It should remain visible through September before moving too close to the sun to observe, reappearing on the opposite side in early December.",

      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty, and freedom. My wife, Mary, was also born and raised in Sacramento. We share cherished memories of younger years, school days, our wedding in 1963, and raising our three children in the city we loved. Sacramento is the place where we stood, in both the real and symbolic sense, to find beginnings and discover perspectives beyond. It is where my father practiced law, and where I \u2014 far too soon \u2014 stepped into his place to take over his practice. It is where my time on the bench began, and where so many of my beliefs about our country, about the rule of law, and about the world were formed.",
      "The West, of course, was imperfect, and is imperfect. Neither the place nor the concept was anything close to idyllic. There were and are scorpions and snakes aplenty. On the frontier, just as in other places, racial, ideological, and gender prejudice were all too common and injurious. But perhaps more than elsewhere, the frontier contained the promise of something better, the promise of community, of tolerance, of growth and ambition, all tempered by the realms in which the reality fell short, many of which are discussed in the pages ahead. But it is in the West where I learned to see people as individuals, beyond their race or religion or gender, beyond whom they loved or how they chose to live their lives, beyond the elements that could have driven us apart. I began to try to understand the common beliefs that brought us together.",
      "Only 116 men and women in our nation's history have served as justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Growing up, it was easy to think of these justices as beyond reproach. And the inequity that they were all white men at the time was slow to dawn upon me. But my image was of nine sages behind closed doors, ruling on some of the most central, and potentially divisive, issues in society. And then, one day, after years spent practicing law, teaching, and then judging on the Ninth Circuit bench, suddenly one of the nine was me.",
      "Reality set in: I hoped to still be the person I had always been. A husband, a father, a diligent reader. But still just a fallible person. For all my years on the bench \u2014 and it gives me pride to say that my service as a justice on the Court was the fifteenth longest in U.S. history \u2014 I took the responsibility seriously, as did each of my colleagues, no matter how much and how often we agreed or disagreed. In doing my best to interpret and apply the Constitution and the law to the cases that came before us, my hope was that my life in the West would help give me the perspective needed to be honest and fair.",
      "Growing up in the West taught me, for example, that the creative energies of a great people cannot be realized unless the realms of economic freedom and personal liberty are respected. It reminded me that central to an individual's claim to personal liberty is the right to fair treatment and to be protected from arbitrary government action. The West reminded me that the most successful businessperson and the lowest-paid worker are each entitled to this basic dignity, a dignity that helped Americans build the frontier and continues to help us today.",
      "The West is so central to my self-understanding that it seems an appropriate place to begin. This Western boy did later go East. But my hope was to stay always close to those Western ideas of liberty and justice. This memoir is my way of putting those ideas on paper, of explaining how a Western boy became a lawyer, a judge, and a justice, seeking always to honor our country's founding principles and to do so with civility, hard work, tolerance, and the ethical foundation our nation must preserve.",

      "Asked whether he would want to be there today, he replied, \"The only reason I left \u2013 I love the Court \u2013 but I left for something that I love more, which is my wife, Mary.\"",
      "Kennedy now has time for his wife and family \u2013 and time to look back. In a new memoir, \"Life, Law & Liberty\" (to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster), Kennedy details how growing up in the West shaped his remarkable legal career, from private practice and teaching law in Sacramento, to sitting on the highest court in the country.",
      "\"I was born in the West and embraced that Western spirit,\" he writes. \"Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty and freedom.\"",
      "Asked if he ever imagined himself sitting on the Supreme Court, Kennedy replied, \"No, or on any court in fact. My father was a solo practitioner, and I took over his solo practice. Actually it took over me. And I had no time to see the kids growing up.\"",
      "So when then-Governor Ronald Reagan asked Kennedy if he would be interested in a federal judgeship, he said yes. \"President Ford had asked him who his recommendation would be, and it seemed to me a good way to be able to spend more time with my family,\" he said.",
      "At just 38 years of age, Kennedy became the youngest judge on the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, but soon discovered that sitting on the bench had its own challenges. Just months after Kennedy was sworn in, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme was charged with the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford. Judge Kennedy presided over her bail hearing. \"Because I was the circuit judge and happened to be in Sacramento that day or that week,\" he said. On the question of whether Fromme should be allowed bail, Kennedy said, \"It took me probably ten seconds to decide no.\"",
      "But just days later, Kennedy says his home in Sacramento was broken into and vandalized. And though he couldn't prove it, he always suspected there was a link.  \"It was terrifying,\" he said. \"Fortunately our U.S. marshals are very good, and nothing happened.\"",
      "More than a decade later, Reagan \u2013 now president \u2013 reached out again, this time with a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Reagan's first pick, Robert Bork, had been rejected by the Senate, and his second, Douglas Ginsburg, had dropped out. Kennedy, the third choice, said yes, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Professor Jamal Greene, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia University, said, \"I think you could make an argument for saying that Justice Kennedy, in his time, was the most influential justice, maybe even in the history of the Court.\"",
      "",
      "Greene got to know Kennedy in 2006 while clerking for another justice on the Court, John Paul Stevens. \"He definitely was a bit of an iconoclast in the sense that he sometimes went with the conservatives, but very often went with the liberal bloc as well,\" Greene said.",
      "And as the \"swing justice\" on the Court, says Greene, Kennedy cast the deciding vote on some of the most consequential political and cultural issues of his era: the 2000 Presidential election, gun ownership, abortion rights, and same-sex marriage.",
      "Greene said, \"One way of measuring that is, the year I was on the Court, there were 25 5-4 decisions, and Justice Kennedy was in the majority in every single one. And there's certainly no one else who came close to that.\"",
      "Kennedy did not take his power lightly. A devout Catholic, he considered resigning from the Court in 1992 while deciding Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but ultimately joined with liberal justices to uphold a woman's right to an abortion.",
      "He said, \"It just seemed to me that this was the woman's right, and that what people of my belief should do is to convince her not to have the abortion, to convince her \u2026 but that she should have the right.\"",
      "Kennedy also wrote the decision in 2015 that recognized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges: \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.\"",
      "Kennedy said, \"Someone told me it passed the refrigerator test, [which means] if there's something that's interesting and well-written, you put it on your refrigerator.\"",
      "All of Kennedy's opinions, says Greene, reflect a common theme: \"If you saw a Supreme Court opinion and saw the words 'freedom' and 'liberty' in the first paragraph, you could be pretty sure that Justice Kennedy was the person who had written that,\" he said.",
      "But since Kennedy stepped down, Greene says, his legacy has begun to fade. In 2022, the Supreme Court (including two of his former clerks, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) reversed Roe v. Wade, ending the federal right to abortion. In his opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the decision behind Roe v. Wade was \"egregiously wrong,\" and that the opinion Kennedy wrote in Planned Parenthood v. Casey \"perpetuated its errors.\"",
      "To which Kennedy says, \"I stand by what we wrote and what we decided. It's a difficult issue.\"",
      "He also noted it is quite infrequent for the Court to overrule one of its own decisions.",
      "It may not be the last Kennedy opinion that's reversed. A petition has already been filed asking the Court to reconsider the case that legalized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Today, Kennedy spends a lot of time with his own \"nine\" \u2013 his grandchildren \u2013 and while he is careful not to criticize the current justices, he admits he worries that some members of the Court may be too public with their differences: \"I'm actually somewhat concerned about the Court,\" he said. \"It's a little bit too personal and confrontational, some of the opinions. I'm hoping that will settle down a little bit.\"",
      "I asked, \"You do write a lot about how important civility is, and ethics. Do you think we've lost sight of that today? Is that another reason why you wrote this book?\"",
      "\"Yes, I'm concerned,\" he replied. \"Democracy presumes an open, rational, thoughtful, decent discussion where you respect the dignity of the person with whom you disagree. And if it doesn't have that, then democracy as we know it is in danger.\"",

      "Back at the house, Krueger lifted restrictions and cleared the bloody scene. It was horrific. But at this point, he believed it was an accident.",

      "Deontae Bristol: I was just holding back tears because we were just hanging out. Like I was just hanging out with this guy.",

      "Deontae Bristol: It had to be an accident.",

      "And that's what Krueger concluded, too.",
      "Det. James Krueger: I just didn't see any need in a small department to tie up all our resources and hold the house for an accident scene.",
      "But the scene did raise questions. Despite a huge amount of blood, first responders didn't see any lacerations on Kevin's head.",

      "She alerted the coroner's office, who ordered an autopsy.",
      "Peter Van Sant: When did this accident scene become a crime scene?",
      "Det. James Krueger: After the autopsy. \u2026 Once they told me that he had a crushed-in skull \u2026 definitely is not consistent with a fall from the stairs. \u2026 that's when I started \u2026 to dig a lot \u2026 deeper into this case.",
      "KEVIN DAVIS' AUTOPSY RESULTS RAISE SUSPICIONS",
      "Three days after Kevin's death, the autopsy was completed and the provocative findings were turned over to police.",
      "Det. James Krueger: I get the autopsy report \u2026 saying that his skull is crushed in, definitely is not consistent with a fall from the stairs.",
      "But Krueger says it is consistent with a violent physical beating.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you now are going \u2026 we may have a homicide on our hands.",
      "James Krueger: Right.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Do you have a suspect in this case?",
      "James Krueger: Yeah, Alison's definitely our suspect. \u2026 You have two people in a house. One is murdered.",
      "It seemed a routine step to launch the murder investigation of Alison Davis. But the New Haven Police Department had a huge challenge \u2014 created by its own decision.",
      "Peter Van Sant: By releasing the scene that meant that family members could \u2013",
      "Det. James Krueger: That meant that anybody \u2014",

      "Det. James Krueger: There is.",
      "Peter Van Sant: There can be contamination of a crime scene.",
      "Det. James Krueger: Yeah.",
      "The day after police received the autopsy, four days after Kevin's death, Krueger got a search warrant. That same day and the next he returned to the house, a bodycam rolling.",
      "DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): I have a couple more search warrants here, OK? First one is I gotta take your phone from ya.",
      "ALISON DAVIS: OK.",
      "Police had been looking for more evidence -- including a possible murder weapon or traces of blood. But by then, Alison's dad had already straightened up as best he could.",
      "Steve Krause: I basically cleaned up the area that I could visually see blood. And it was around where Kevin was on the floor. \u2026 It's right there at the bottom of the steps.",
      "DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): So if I could gather the phone first?",
      "ALISON DAVIS: Yes, let me grab that.",
      "Alison shared with Klemm a growing unease she couldn't shake.",

      "DET. JAMES KRUEGER (bodycam video): Is that password protected?",
      "ALISON DAVIS: Yes.",
      "Kasey Klemm: \u2026 cause that was a lot of their memories. \u2026 pictures to \u2026 look back on.",
      "Alison would say she initially spoke willingly to investigators, doing all police asked of her.",
      "Peter Van Sant: She would talk to whomever wanted to speak with her, is that right?",
      "Kasey Klemm: Yeah. She had nothing to hide. Why would she?",
      "Steve Krause: There's \u2026 nothing that suggests there was anything other than a fall down the stairs.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And for you this was a tragic accident.",
      "Steve Krause: Of course \u2026 It was!",
      "And as the spotlight turned to Alison Davis, at the East Haven Tavern, there were plenty who voiced their support.",
      "Jodi Espy: There's no way.",
      "Peter Van Sant: There's no way what?",
      "Jodi Epsy: That she could've done that, she could've killed him. There's no way.",
      "Jessica Eakright: I could not imagine in any world where she would be wanted for murder.",
      "The tavern crowd tells the story of that night. Alison was working retail at Victoria's Secret. When she finished, she headed over. As usual, Kevin was waiting for her.",
      "Peter Van Sant: On that night \u2026 where was he sitting?",
      "Jodi Espy: He was sitting over here at the bar.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And his mood that night was?",
      "Jodi Espy: Was good, he was happy, he was friendly.",

      "Kevin had a second, then a third beer and some vodka shots. Alison sipped on her usual -- a sweet cocktail.",
      "Jessica Eakright: It didn't seem that she was drinking excessively at all.",
      "The East Haven Tavern regulars carried on. Kevin could get a little loud, his friends say, but they knew, that was just Kevin being Kevin.",

      "Peter Van Sant: What does \"a lot\" mean?",
      "Jodi Espy: He was very opinionated.",
      "Jessica Eakright: But she \u2014 she loved him through it.",
      "Soon it was after midnight; time to turn in.",
      "Jessica Eakright: They were calling it a night, winding down.",
      "Alison left the tavern first, with Kevin following shortly after.",
      "Jessica Eakright: I think it was about one.",
      "Kevin and his buddy Jason Young started texting.",

      "ALISON DAVIS: Um, he fell down the stairs, just now. I was sleeping downstairs. All I heard -- all of a sudden, I heard a loud noise.",

      "Det. James Krueger: This call is about her. It's not about Kevin.",
      "And even as their bodycams rolled, police officers Hetrick and Shanebrook questioned if Alison was genuinely concerned, as Kevin lay dying.",

    "story": [
      "\"Willow,\" a black and white female pit bull mix loved by her owners, didn't seem destined to become a key figure in a murder investigation. But that's exactly what happened. It was Aug. 12, 2023, when the dog became known to law enforcement in New Haven, Indiana.",
      "That morning, police would hear about Willow, and how she was a protective guard dog. But they wouldn't meet her. And that's one of many places where this story gets fascinating as correspondent Peter Van Sant reports in \"A Death in the Stairwell,\" an all-new \"48 Hours\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Willow belonged to Kevin and Alison Davis, a married couple. Steve Krause, Alison Davis' father, tells Van Sant how much Kevin and Alison loved each other, calling each other \"babe.\" Alison Davis' best friend, Kasey Klemm, says they were a happy couple who danced together in the kitchen. Krause explains, \"They had no children, so the dog was \u2026 like a child\" to them. Their friend, Jason Young, says that Willow was \"a big barker and kind of intimidating at first,\" but that in \"two minutes the dog doesn't care about you anymore.\"",
      "The night Kevin Davis sustained his injuries, he and Alison Davis had been out together at a local tavern. Friends and the tavern staff say it was a typical night and that they seemed happy when they headed home around 1 a.m. Alison Davis would later tell police that when they did get home, she and Kevin had an argument, so she went to sleep on a couch downstairs. Kevin Davis headed to their upstairs bedroom \u2013 where Willow was too. Alison Davis says she was awakened by a loud noise. She says she found Kevin Davis unresponsive, face down, in a large pool of blood. Alison Davis would tell a 911 operator and first responders that Kevin Davis had fallen down the stairs.",
      "After emergency responders rushed Kevin Davis to the hospital, Det. James Krueger would question Alison Davis. She would sign paperwork, giving consent to police to enter and search the home. But Alison Davis warned the detective about Willow: \"She's a guard dog. I don't know if she'd do anything, and I don't want anything to happen to her,\" said Alison Davis.",
      "Krueger told her he wouldn't go in that room. He says when he went upstairs, \"I could hear the dog walking around in there \u2026 So I cracked the door open \u2026 I got the teeth, and the growls and everything. And there was no way that dog was letting me in that room.\" Krueger looked around the rest of the house. He felt \"everything checked out\" and that Alison Davis' story was true \u2014 this was a tragic, fatal fall.",
      "Kevin Davis had massive traumatic injuries to his head. He would not survive another day. Family and friends say Alison Davis was devastated by the loss of the husband she loved. But police came to think differently. Four months later, Indiana authorities would charge Alison Davis with murder. Detective Krueger concluded, \"This is a wife that lost it and beat her husband to death.\" Authorities say she used an improvised weapon, like an exercise weight, perhaps a baseball bat. But no weapon was ever found.",
      "After 17 months of incarceration, Alison Davis \u2014 who has always maintained her innocence \u2014 would go on trial for murder. In just six hours, the jury would come to its verdict. Alison Davis is not guilty.",
      "Krueger, who had been promoted to chief of police, believes the verdict might have been different if only he had gotten into Willow's room that August morning. \"I think that dog may have been intentionally put in that room to keep me out,\" Krueger tells Van Sant. Krueger adds, there could have been \"the blunt force object \u2026 in that room \u2026 something in that room that would've helped with the case.\"",
      "After the trial, a juror told Van Sant that the prosecution's case \"had a lot of holes.\" And that there were strong reasons why the jury had voted to acquit Alison Davis. Still, Police Chief Krueger says he will always wonder if there could have been a murder weapon in Willow's room.",
      "\"There's no evidence \u2026 It's unbelievable. Such injustice,\" says Krause. \"This is just strictly an accident.\"",
      "Alison Davis is free, now living with her mother and father. She's trying to put her life back together, without Kevin, the man her dad says always called her \"babe.\" And by her side, as she always has been, is Willow."

      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

      "Luigi Mangione's lawyers asked a New York judge to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "In papers filed Saturday in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack, in which a gun and ammunition were found.",
      "They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024.",
      "They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack.",
      "Mangione's lawyers want death penalty off the table",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting.",
      "The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.",
      "Five days later, a tip from a McDonald's about 233 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since.",
      "In September, lawyers for Mangione asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\"",
      "Last month, a Manhattan Criminal Court judge\u00a0dismissed Mangione's state terrorism charges after his lawyers argued the parallel cases amounted to double jeopardy.",
      "Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other \"crimes of violence.\" It's the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.",
      "The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime -- stalking -- is not a crime of violence.",
      "The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.",
      "After the killing, investigators found the words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and \"depose,\" written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics."

      "\"We've recovered no survivors,\" Davis said.",
      "Davis also said he did not yet have details on the identities of the victims as of Saturday night. The sheriff said earlier in the day that teams will enter to start conducting a rapid DNA search to identify the victims. There were no updates regarding injuries.",
      "The explosion took place at Accurate Energetic Systems, a military explosives plant, around 7:45 a.m. Central time on Friday morning, according to Davis. The blast occurred in one of the eight buildings on the campus. Video from the scene showed damaged vehicles and charred debris scattered around the area.",
      "Earlier officials said 19 people were missing, but revised the number on Saturday, saying a person who was initially believed to be on site was located safely at home. Another person was also later found to not have been there at the time of the explosion,\u00a0Tennessee Emergency Management Agency\u00a0said.",

      "The cause of the explosion was not yet known, and the investigation could take days, the sheriff said.",
      "Agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on site, Davis said. The Metro Nashville Police Department Bomb Squad also\u00a0said\u00a0it was responding to help process the scene. Davis said he expected crews to remain on the site for several days.",
      "Sources close to the investigation told CBS News on Saturday morning that investigators are back assessing the site of the blast. The area \"appears to be much more unstable than they thought,\" which is slowing down the process, and there are some small fires still smoldering around the building, sources said.",
      "Davis warned there could be continued small explosions at the site.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now, here in studio, by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Thank you for being with us.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just on this topic, I know you have a lot of differences with the President, but on this, is this a clear win?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a cease fire. It's important that these hostages are coming home, and I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's, there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully as these hostages are released. But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year. And it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today. So again, this will be a good week, but as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There is no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There is certainly a risk of hostilities beginning again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. My understanding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Yeah. I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu, and Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so, clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown. And when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, I listened to the Vice President, and he's just not living in reality. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 What do you mean? --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- The fact is, well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class. The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files. So JD Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations and raising premiums, raising health care costs by 75% on American citizens. So yes, I think that Democrats should say if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- That's the average, but in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here. But you did hear the Vice President say, when it came to health care, the administration is open to a discussion, we want to lower insurance premiums. That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance at an opening?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- They've been on an unprecedented five week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut and they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to the law. I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is just the seven week deal that we're talking about at this point, the short term funding --",
      "SEN. MURPHY: -- Correct, the long term budget that we pass ultimately has to require that the president not engage in mass scale corruption. But a short term agreement, certainly is not going to fix all of the problems that exist right now in the way the President is running the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018, you were back in 2013 when it was a discussion over health care. This is what you said in 2018.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SEN. MURPHY: The future of the American health care system was a legitimate public policy issue, as is the security of our borders, but we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown, trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, that was a fight over, sort of, the long term structure of the American health care system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75% and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not--",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about health care, that there will be any follow through?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No, you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president, and the reason is because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking- we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system. We're simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases, by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Minority Leader gave an interview to Punchbowl this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview, he said, every day this goes on, every day gets better for us. The Speaker of the House said that was this callous statement.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Well, they're- they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying. Listen, our priority is the American people. And yes, it is true, as every day--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past, back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SEN. MURPHY: No. As every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are breaking with JD Vance and President Trump and saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the President's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point, there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed, their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed, by these enormous increases in health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but in the meantime, there's also the not- not getting a paycheck problem for some of these people.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Where's the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down and reopening the government, they would be in Washington rather than spread out all over the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. MURPHY: Appreciate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

You are a House lawmaker in town, but I want to talk to you about your intelligence portfolio. The Financial Times is reporting, right now, that the United States is helping Ukraine to target Russian oil installations. In other words, hitting Russia right in that pocketbook. What can you say in regard to how the Trump administration is changing its policy? Are they truly now standing up to Vladimir Putin?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, not really, right. We've heard now for months that we're two weeks away. I think that's the President's terminology, used several times now over many months from really cracking down on Russia. And of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House, so it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it, have it both ways. Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20%. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again, without being specific, that I wish the President would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians, but he hasn't taken any meaningful step back- steps back from the Biden administration, so we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that, perhaps, he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military? Not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",
      "REP. HIMES:\u00a0 Well, again, I don't want to get- I don't want to get specific with respect to authorities, but, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric. There, I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pullback, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance to the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelensky and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable. Venezuela: There are close to- the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the Southern Command region of operations. There have been four US strikes on vessels. The US says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions, and you did it along with the Head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the US knows what is being done?",
      "REP. HIMES: I mean one of the many troubling aspects about these lethal attacks in the Caribbean against supposedly drug-dealing boats. Now, we don't know that, because, unlike our counterterrorism programs, the Congress is not being told who were on these boats, how they were identified, what the intelligence was, totally different thing. Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's okay, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not okay with me. I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here, because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that, based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States, and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers- Venezuelan drug dealers is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore --",
      "REP. HIMES: Doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action. So, their legal justifications are laughable and what- and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what amazes me about that is that the President, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the Secretary of Defense? What about the Deputy? What about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear legal authority? What about them? Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if, in the next couple of years, there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command, because it is not at all clear, well, it is getting increasingly clear, that these are that these are illegal killings. Setting aside the law for a second here. Margaret, you know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate military action, which it's not, because the Congress hasn't approved it, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation of the laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. Okay, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- are you saying that these were not lawful orders? That the military was- because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry. Our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military who were the trigger pullers did something else?",
      "REP. HIMES: I am saying that, to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get 1,000 different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that, at best, the legal authorities are questionable. So I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal. They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarized environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made. But, the worm turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968 we prosecuted, convicted of murder a lieutenant, Lieutenant Cawley, because he and his unit killed, probably, hundreds of people in My Lai and Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's okay. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But, I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state. We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank, to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no-interest loans to 45,000 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash-crunch for a lot of people. What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REP. HIMES: So, I mean, I will tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23 year olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the Vice President on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the house. So when the Vice President United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The President posts on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is- which is- which is pretty tentative to say the best. The Speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shutdown would require legislation. The Speaker of the House has taken that off the table. So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But, I don't see anything moving. The house is, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the house is on vacation. So no, I don't think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Speaker says that if the government wasn't shut down, the military be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But, no one's working right now, as you just said. We'll have to continue to track this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Vice President JD Vance that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

    "story": [
      "At a massive military parade attended by foreign leaders, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rolled out his nuclear-armed military's most powerful weapons, including a new intercontinental ballistic missile he may be preparing to test in coming weeks.",
      "The parade, which began in the rain Friday night at Pyongyang's main square and marked the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party, highlighted Kim's growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build an arsenal that could target the continental United States and his rivals in Asia.",
      "North Korean state media said Saturday that the parade featured a new, yet-to-be-tested ICBM called the Hwasong-20, which it described as the country's \"most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.\"",
      "Joined by high-level Chinese, Vietnamese and Russian officials at a podium, Kim said in a speech that his military \"should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,\" but made no direct mention of the United States or South Korea.",
      "He also praised the thousands of North Korean soldiers he sent to Russia to join its war against Ukraine, saying they displayed \"heroic fighting spirit\" and \"ideological and spiritual perfection\" in a battle for \"international justice and genuine peace.\"",
      "Edited footage from North Korean state television showed what appeared to be tens of thousands of spectators packed into the brightly lit square, cheering and waving the national flag as columns of goose-stepping soldiers and missile-mounted vehicles rolled through the rain-soaked streets. The soldiers included troops Kim had sent to Russia, who marched under North Korean and Russian flags as state media hailed them as \"invincible\" warriors.",
      "North Korea, in recent years, has flight-tested a variety of ICBMs that could potentially reach the U.S. mainland, including missiles with built-in solid propellants that are easier to move and conceal and can be prepared for launch more quickly than the North's previous liquid-fueled missiles.",
      "The parade saw the debut of the massive Hwasong-20, with at least three of them wheeled out on 11-axle launcher trucks.",
      "The new missile's existence was first revealed in recent weeks as North Korea tested a new solid-fuel rocket engine that it said was intended for future ICBMs. State media said the engine, built with carbon fiber, is more powerful than past models.",
      "Kim has called for the development of multi-warhead systems that would improve the chances of penetrating missile defenses, and some experts say the\u00a0Hwasong-20\u00a0could be designed for that purpose.",
      "Other weapons on display included shorter-range ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles, which the North previously described as capable of delivering nuclear strikes against targets in South Korea. The parade also featured Kim's newest tanks, artillery systems and drones, which have been a key focus of his efforts to\u00a0expand\u00a0his conventional military capabilities after he spent much of his early rule concentrating on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.",
      "Kim this week hosted a rare group of high-level foreign officials sent to Pyongyang to attend the anniversary celebrations, including Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of Moscow's Security Council, and Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary To Lam.",
      "During the parade, Kim took the central spot at the podium, flanked by Li to his right and Lam to his left, while Medvedev stood next to Lam.",
      "The high-level visits highlight Kim's increasingly assertive foreign policy as he seeks to break out of isolation and establish a larger role for North Korea in a united front against the U.S.-led West. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president's first term. In a recent speech, Kim urged Washington to drop its demand for the North to surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming diplomacy.",
      "Kim also visited China last month and shared center stage with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a massive military parade.",
      "Kim on Friday separately met with Medvedev to discuss developing the \"comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance\" with Russia, the official Korean Central News Agency said. Medvedev praised the \"bravery and self-sacrificing spirit\" of North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Russian forces to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region, and called for expanded exchanges and cooperation between the two governments. Kim had also met Li and Lam on Thursday for talks on strengthening ties."

Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.",
      "The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited \"a lot of feedback.\"",

      "Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar",
      "Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing \"his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,\" according to a White House readout of the call.",
      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",
      "Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas \"had had enough.\"",
      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",

      "Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table",

They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",

      "\"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues,\" the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials.",
      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",

      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

      "This story has been corrected to show that the Alphaliner report was from last month, not this month."

    "summary": "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice joined CBS News' Norah O'Donnell for a discussion of the Israel-Hamas deal as the ceasefire begins in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.",
      "Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the Israel-Hamas peace plan brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape.",
      "The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has called the deal the \"first phase\" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages.",
      "\"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war.",
      "\"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East,\" Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal \u2014 and that still isn't certain.",
      "\"That's not self-evident,\" Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.\"",
      "One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said.",
      "\"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?\" Rice asked. \"The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood.\"",
      "Clinton called Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September \"ill-advised\" and a \"strategic error\" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening.",
      "\"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'\"",
      "Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, \"They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.\"",
      "Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said.",
      "\"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East,\" Rice said. \"And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security.\"",
      "Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government \"has to cease.\"",
      "She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.",
      "\"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,\" Clinton said.",
      "The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year ordeal that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and nearly uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military.",
      "Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed \"technocratic\" committee that does not include Hamas and \u2014 at least for now \u2014 also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.",
      "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history \u2014 including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton pressed for a two-state solution\u00a0 \u2014 but Obama struggled with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace.",
      "But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

      "In the 2016 op-ed, Aniston slammed the media for defining \"a woman\u2019s value based on her marital and maternal status,\" saying she and her husband at the time, Justin Theroux, were being \"harassed by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home\" trying to snap a photo of her and \"uncover whether or not I am pregnant (for the bajillionth time... but who\u2019s counting).\"",

She stands among many other Democrats who have also declined to do so after text messages surfaced in which Jones fantasized about killing his Republican colleague in 2022.",

But Virginia Democrats and other party leaders around the country have refused to cave to pressure they are getting to demand Jones drop out.",

Warner was also pressed on whether he would demand Jones return a $25,000 donation made to his campaign in August, or whether he regretted the show of support in light of the controversy about Jones' violent political speech, but he once again averted his gaze and remained silent.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was also unwilling to call on Jones' to drop out. He told Fox News Digital he's still a supporter of the embattled candidate for his state's attorney general seat. \"I think those statements were not in character, and he has apologized \u2014 I wish other people in public life would sincerely apologize for stuff,\" the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee said. \"I've known Jay Jones for 25 years.\"",

      "\"Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,\" Jones wrote. In a subsequent text, Jones also wrote, \"Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.\"",

      "\"There are far too many on the left that celebrate political violence,\" Cruz continued, adding, \"When Charlie Kirk was assassinated, we saw leftists, college professors, leftist schoolteachers, politicians, journalists celebrating that heinous murder.\"",
      "\"And every Democrat in Washington is turning a blind eye,\" Cruz added. \"In my view, the notion that someone advocating for the murder of children because he disagrees politically with their father is manifestly unsuitable for public office, especially the chief law enforcement officer of Virginia.

      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders. This is especially useful if you ever use Wi-Fi in public or need an extra layer of privacy at home. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections. But in a well-secured home network, the difference is often smaller than most people think. What matters more is how you manage your devices, passwords, software, and online habits.",

      "Speaking at the United Nations on Tuesday, the first lady announced \"Fostering the Future Together,\" a coalition for children's tech safety which will launch at the White House in early 2026. (Credit: POOL)",
      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children. Names, photos, addresses, birthdates, parental details and even safeguarding notes and medical records were allegedly accessed by a hacker group called Radiant.",

      "The incident highlights how stolen data threatens not just privacy but also long-term child safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",
      "Parents reported being directly contacted by attackers, showing how intimidation adds to the harm. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps parents can take to protect their child's data",
      "Even though the investigation into the Kido breach is ongoing, parents and schools can take immediate action to protect children's data and reduce the risk of further exploitation. Here's a detailed guide:",
      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "These services can continuously scan for your child's personal information online and alert you if their data appears on suspicious websites or the dark web. This early warning allows you to take action before criminals attempt to exploit it.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "A strong antivirus program protects devices from malware, phishing scams, and suspicious scripts. It is particularly important on devices that children use to access school portals or personal accounts. This ensures that if a hacker tries to use malware to get deeper access, it is blocked.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data breaches targeting children are particularly concerning because they can have long-lasting consequences.

      "Parents and teachers admit the workaround is clever. One teacher said she respects her students' determination to stay connected and even acknowledged that the phone ban has improved behavior and focus in class. Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in. One parent told CyberGuy that some kids in their district are buying MacBooks just so they can text each other through iMessage.

But the trend is also stirring debate. Some parents see it as a harmless way for kids to adapt, while others worry it undermines the entire point of the ban. Educators are split too, amused by the ingenuity, yet frustrated that students are still finding ways to drift off task during lessons. The viral clips prove one thing for sure: when it comes to tech, today's teens will always find a workaround.",

They're chatting through shared Google Docs, buying MacBooks so they can iMessage during class, swapping notes over email, and even sticking to old-school Post-Its to stay in touch. While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating. For teachers, it's a reminder that managing distractions in the classroom goes beyond phone policies. Laptops, messaging apps, and even simple sticky notes can become back doors for the same behaviors schools are trying to limit.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",
      "\"I received a spam email from my employer's email. It had a document attached to it. I tried to open it and could not. I contacted my employer and they told me they hadn't sent me anything. I changed my password and ran a virus scan. I also have been checking on the dark web for anything coming up on me. So far everything is okay. I did sign up for antivirus software based on your recommendation and we are signed up for identity theft protection. Is there anything else I should do?\"",
      "Incidents like this are more common than many realize, Krysti. And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking. A close call is often a warning sign that your digital habits might need tightening. Let's break down why these attacks are so dangerous and what everyone should do to make sure they're fully protected.",

      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",
      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Opening a fake attachment can secretly install malware or spyware on your device. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Work email scams are rising, and even experienced professionals can get fooled. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "HOW FAKE MICROSOFT ALERTS TRICK YOU INTO PHISHING SCAMS",
      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",
      "Your information might already be circulating in dark web marketplaces without you realizing it. Identity theft protection services can help by continuously scanning those underground sites for your email, passwords or other sensitive details. If your data does show up, these services notify you right away so you can reset credentials, freeze accounts or take other protective actions before the information is misused.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most major platforms allow you to turn on alerts for unusual account activity, such as new sign-ins, password resets or changes to security settings. These real-time notifications act as an early warning system, giving you a chance to lock down your accounts before significant damage occurs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Close calls like this are unsettling, but they are also valuable wake-up calls. Cybercriminals are constantly refining their tactics, and phishing emails that once looked laughably fake can now be nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. The key is to build layers of defense, not just reactive steps after an incident, but proactive habits that make you a harder target in the first place.",

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies. It helps guide the breathing tube into place quickly, safely, and with far less training than traditional methods.",

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

      "Digital scams take advantage of families during this time. They rely on probate records in particular, as they contain sensitive information and are a part of the public record. Fraudsters pose as attorneys, debt collectors and estate service providers, each demanding the immediate payment of made-up fees. This is also known as the \"inheritance trap.\" It's a growing kind of cybercrime where scammers exploit public probate records to target grieving families when they're at their most vulnerable.",

      "There are four common types of inheritance traps that use probate records as sources for their fraudulent claims:",
      "The fake fee scam: Just like the\u00a0DMV notice scam that claims the recipient has unpaid toll fees, scammers use probate data to pose as attorneys or court officials, claiming heirs owe fees to release inheritance funds. They create urgency with threats of legal action or frozen assets, demanding payment via wire transfer or gift cards.",
      "The fake debt collector: Fraudsters send texts or make AI-generated voice calls, claiming that the deceased person owed debts that have to be settled immediately. They often have enough information from probate records to sound legitimate, pressuring families to pay non-existent debts.",
      "The fake estate service: Scams that offer seemingly helpful services like \"property appraisals,\" \"finding hidden assets,\" or \"estate clean-out services\" can look like they offer reasonable deals. Some take payment and disappear\u2014others perform unnecessary services that families never requested.",
      "Cyberguy lays out ways to avoid inheritance scams. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines. When something demands immediate action, victims feel compelled to respond before verifying claims or consulting attorneys, which is exactly what fraudsters count on.",

      "How to protect yourself against the inheritance trap",
      "The good news is that with awareness and a few smart steps, you can lower your risk of falling victim to inheritance scams.",
      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",
      "Data removal services specialize in removing personal information from data broker sites that scammers use to supplement probate data. Personal information combined with probate records create the perfect setup for inheritance traps\u2014scammers can make super-convincing, alarmist content that can bypass your intuition about scams, especially during times of grief.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The probate system creates a privacy trade-off. You can't prevent much of this information from entering the public record, but you can control how you respond, and how much personal data is out there. Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney. With a little vigilance and a bit of data cleanup, you can ensure that the probate process doesn't put you in harm's way, during the time when you're at your most vulnerable.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'",
      "Automotive giant Stellantis has just revealed that it suffered a data breach, exposing customer contact details, after attackers infiltrated a third-party platform used for North American customer services. The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions. These earlier incidents exposed names, emails and phone numbers, which were sufficient for attackers to launch phishing campaigns or extortion attempts.",

      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "What you need to know about the Stellantis breach",
      "Stellantis was formed in 2021 through the merger of the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",
      "Stellantis has not revealed how many customers the breach affected. The company also has not specified which contact fields, such as email, phone, or address, attackers accessed.",
      "The alleged culprit, ShinyHunters, and Salesforce breaches",
      "While Stellantis has not explicitly named the hacker group behind the breach, multiple sources tie this incident to the ShinyHunters extortion campaign, which has spearheaded a wave of data thefts targeting Salesforce this year.",
      "ShinyHunters claims to have stolen over 18 million records from Stellantis' Salesforce instance, which includes names and contact details, according to Bleeping Computer. These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers. In recent months, ShinyHunters has often worked in concert with groups like Scattered Spider and targeted companies including Google, Cisco, Adidas, Allianz Life, Qantas and brands under LVMH such as Dior and Tiffany & Co.",

      "The attack is linked to a wider wave of Salesforce data thefts this year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Their reported method is fairly ingenious. Attackers exploit OAuth tokens tied to integrations like Salesloft's Drift AI chat tool to pivot into Salesforce environments. Once inside, they can harvest valuable metadata, credentials, AWS keys, Snowflake tokens and more.",
      "In fact, the FBI recently issued a Flash alert that surfaced numerous indicators of compromise linked to these Salesforce environment attacks and warned organizations to harden defenses. The cumulative toll is staggering. ShinyHunters asserts it has stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records across some 760 companies.",
      "7 ways to protect yourself from breaches like Stellantis",
      "Even if only contact details were exposed, that's enough for attackers to target you. Here's how to stay protected.",
      "Even basic contact details can be scraped from breaches and sold on data broker platforms, where they are used for spam, scams and targeted attacks.

      "Stolen emails and phone numbers could fuel phishing campaigns. (REUTERS /Rebecca Cook)",
      "The most immediate risk after a breach like this is targeted phishing. Attackers now have legitimate contact details, so their emails and texts can look convincingly real. Be skeptical of any message claiming to be from Stellantis, your car brand or a related service, especially if it urges you to click a link, download an attachment or share personal details.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "If attackers get your contact information, they may try the same password on other sites. This is called credential stuffing. A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk. It also helps you quickly update credentials in case you suspect a compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "2FA adds an extra step to your logins by requiring a temporary code or approval in addition to your password. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they will need that second factor to gain access. This significantly reduces the chances of account takeover attempts succeeding.",
      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "After a breach, it is worth auditing your accounts, not just with Stellantis but also with related services such as financing portals, insurance accounts or loyalty programs. Look for unusual sign-ins, unfamiliar devices, or changes to your personal details. Most services offer tools to review login history and security events, making checking these a routine habit.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even giants in manufacturing are vulnerable when cloud platforms and third-party systems are part of their customer workflow. The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",

      "More than 2.8 million Brits have signed a petition as of Wednesday, calling on the U.K. government to reverse its mandatory Digital ID system over concerns it will lead to \"mass surveillance and digital control.\"",
      "The ID program, dubbed \"Brit Card\" and announced last week by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is set to be rolled out by August 2029 in an attempt by the Labour government to crack down on illegal immigration as it would bar anyone who doesn\u2019t have a digital ID from working in the U.K.",
      "But critics of the plan argue its effects on illegal immigration will not be significant enough to make up for the privacy concerns it poses.",

      "But according to one security expert, digital ID is actually not nearly as concerning as most opponents of the system believe it to be.",
      "\"When the government issues a digital ID, they're issuing it to the individual. That means, just like your paper ID sits in your physical wallet, your digital ID sits in your digital wallet, it's not stored at a central location,\" Eric Starr, founder and CEO of\u00a0Ultrapass Identity Corp, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"When you pass your digital ID to a relying party, they don't ping a central database,\" he continued. \"They look at the digital ID you've presented, and through cryptography, can determine the authenticity of the digital document.\"",

      "Starr, whose company works with governments around the world to provide decentralized digital ID options, said the controversy around digital ID comes down to poor conception and a lack of understanding.",
      "The tech guru said he believes the U.K. went about its rollout of a digital ID the wrong way by making it mandatory and releasing few details on the system itself.",
      "Starr argued that governments have the right to know who its citizens are and nations, including the U.S., already have systems in place that keep track of its people, including by issuing social security numbers \u2013 a system that the U.S. has relied on since 1936.",
      "When pressed about concerns relating to a government\u2019s ability to enforce mass surveillance through the ease that the technology could offer, even if that is not the original intent, Starr said it comes down to establishing those protections for personal privacy from the get-go.",

      "\"We care deeply about personal freedom in ways that other countries don't think about it, and generally speaking, individuals don't want the federal government in their business every day,\" Starr explained in reference to the American public. \"The fear that people have about digital identity is that it's a surveillance opportunity.\"",
      "Starr explained that some are concerned that any time a digital ID is used, it will then alert or \"phone home\" a government tracking system \u2013 a concern that privacy advocates like the\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation\u00a0and the\u00a0ACLU have flagged.",
      "\"It's not about the technology, but managing fear and managing what actually gets deployed,\" he added, noting that safeguards can be put in place to counter these concerns.",
      "Even though there is no federal version of a digital ID, more than a dozen states have already begun issuing mobile driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "A federal version of a digital ID would, in theory, just include an individual\u2019s information that the government already has access to, including details like passport information.",
      "But there\u2019s another major concern people flag when it comes to digital IDs \u2013 how to ensure personal information is protected from identity theft, which has become a major concern in recent years amid mass cyber breaches.",

      "According to Starr, the \"architecture of digital identity\" is different from centralized databases used by institutions like hospitals, which have found themselves vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches.",
      "Decentralized systems, as in the case of a digital ID, make hacking \"nearly impossible\" because \"the only way to hack a million IDs is to hack a million phones,\" he explained.",
      "\"There are solutions. It's not a technology issue, it's an education issue, it's a fear issue,\" Starr said. \"It's also poorly conceived solutions that open the door for bad behavior.\"",

      "Asked by moderator Kristen Welker whether the White House was seriously considering invoking the 1807 statute, Vance said, \u201cThe president is looking at all his options.\u201d",

      "\"But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,\" Trump added last week. \"If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that.\"",
      "On Saturday, a federal appeals court blocked the White House from deploying federalized National Guard troops in Illinois. The troops can remain federalized, the court said, but cannot be deployed. Ahead of the court\u2019s ruling, National Guard troops had already begun arriving in the greater Chicago area.",
      "The governments of Illinois and Chicago filed lawsuits after Trump announced the move, prompting a federal judge to temporarily block the administration from deploying National Guard troops there. The White House appealed the first judge's ruling to 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which ruled against the deployments.",

      "The Trump administration initially tried to deploy Oregon National Guard troops in Portland, but when that move was blocked in court, the administration moved to deploy troops from California to Portland instead. A federal judge ruled that the White House could not send National Guard troops from any other state to Portland as well.",
      "The appeals court panel indicated it may be open to reversing the lower court\u2019s decision. It\u2019s unclear when the court might ultimately rule. One judge on the panel said the court would try to rule as soon as possible."

      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have proposed a temporary funding measure that would keep the government open through Oct. 31. That continuing resolution would also reverse Medicaid cuts passed by Republicans earlier this year and would extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Graham on Sunday said that negotiating a potential extension of subsidies while the government was shut down was a nonstarter for him, referencing the 2018-19 government shutdown, where Republicans and President Donald Trump tried to force Democrats to pass funding for a border wall.",
      "\u201cYou know, we shut the government down for 35 days, Republicans trying to force the Democrats to build the border wall,\u201d Graham told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cWell, we eventually got the wall built, but not because we shut down the government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subsidies we\u2019re talking about here,\u201d Graham added, \u201cif the Affordable Care Act is so affordable, why, every time I turn around, are we spending $350 billion to keep it afloat?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., earlier in the program blasted Republicans for refusing to negotiate with Democrats, saying Trump had only spoken to Democratic leaders for an hour about the ACA subsidies.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important for all Americans to know that this fight right now over this government shutdown is about one thing. It\u2019s about the cost of their health care,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cTens of millions of people \u2014 actually, about 19 million people get their health care off the Affordable Care Act, and their rates are going to go up dramatically, and it\u2019s going to become unaffordable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president has negotiated for one hour, as far as we can tell, and Republicans in the House, they\u2019ve been gone for four weeks. And John Thune, the majority leader in the Senate, sent people home for four days,\u201d Kelly added.",
      "He noted that the House passed the stopgap funding measure on Sept. 19 and has not returned to Washington since then. On Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson told House lawmakers that he was extending their district work period for at least another week, through mid-October.",
      "Asked whether Democrats would vote to reopen the government if Republicans promised to hold a vote on extending ACA subsidies once the government reopens, Kelly firmly said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot right now, no,\u201d the Arizona senator said. \u201cWe need a real negotiation, and we need a fix. We need this corrected for the American people. This is for so many people \u2014 their health care is running towards a cliff, and if we don\u2019t fix this, it\u2019s going to go right over it.\u201d",
      "Kelly added that in order for Democrats to reopen the government, they would need assurances that Republicans wouldn\u2019t just hold a vote on extending subsidies, but that both sides could agree on what an extension would look like.",
      "\u201cHaving some vote without an assured outcome\u201d wasn\u2019t the solution, Kelly said.",
      "\u201cAll this is going to take is putting everybody in a room for an extended period of time and coming up to some reasonable conclusion,\u201d he added.",
      "In later separate interviews on Fox News, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dug in to their party's stances on the government shutdown.",
      "Johnson accused Democrats of not wanting to negotiate on healthcare subsidies, saying that Democrats are \u201ceating up the clock\u201d because Republicans \u201chad always been counting on using these four weeks in October to finish up those discussions.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Jeffries explained why Democrats are adamant that the subsidies need to be extended now, rather than closer to their expiration date at the end of the year.",
      "\u201cOpen enrollment starts on November 1st,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cTens of millions of Americans are receiving notices right now that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to explode, which is why we need to address it. Even [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene agrees that we have to address this health insurance crisis right now.\u201d",
      "Johnson also responded to Rep. Greene's concerns about healthcare, as she has criticized her party's reluctance to engage on the issue in recent days.",
      "\"I had a thoughtful conversation with my friend Marjorie Taylor Greene on the phone the other night, a couple nights ago to inform her that there are many Republicans in Congress that have been working around the clock on this,\" Johnson told Fox News."

    "summary": "While Sora has some guardrails around the likenesses of living people, protections around the likenesses of those who have died appear to be an afterthought.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI\u2019s new text-to-video app, Sora, was supposed to be a social AI playground, allowing users to create imaginative AI videos of themselves, friends and celebrities while building off of others\u2019 ideas.",
      "The social structure of the app, which allows users to adjust the availability of their likeness in others\u2019 videos, seemed to address the most pressing questions of consent around AI-generated video when it was launched last week.",
      "But as Sora sits atop the iOS App Store with over 1 million downloads, experts worry about its potential to deluge the internet with historical misinformation and deepfakes of deceased historical figures who cannot consent to or opt out of Sora\u2019s AI models.",
      "In less than a minute, the app can generate short videos of deceased celebrities in situations they were never in: Aretha Franklin making soy candles, Carrie Fisher trying to balance on a slackline, Nat King Cole ice skating in Havana and Marilyn Monroe teaching Vietnamese to schoolchildren, for instance.",
      "That\u2019s a nightmare for people like Adam Streisand, an attorney who has represented several celebrity estates, including Monroe\u2019s at one point.",
      "\u201cThe challenge with AI is not the law,\u201d Streisand said in an email, pointing out that California\u2019s courts have long protected celebrities \u201cfrom AI-like reproductions of their images or voices.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe question is whether a non-AI judicial process that depends on human beings will ever be able to play an almost 5th dimensional game of whack-a-mole.\u201d",
      "Videos on Sora range from the absurd to the delightful to the confusing. Aside from celebrities, many videos on Sora show convincing deepfakes of manipulated historical moments.",
      "For example, NBC News was able to generate realistic videos of President Dwight Eisenhower confessing to accepting millions of dollars in bribes, U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arguing that the \u201cso-called D-Day landings\u201d were overblown, and President John F. Kennedy announcing that the moon landing was \u201cnot a triumph of science but a fabrication.\u201d",
      "The ability to generate such deepfakes of nonconsenting deceased individuals has already caused complaints from family members.",
      "In an Instagram story posted Monday about Sora videos featuring Robin Williams, who died in 2014, Williams\u2019 daughter Zelda wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It\u2019s dumb, it\u2019s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it\u2019s NOT what he\u2019d want.\u201d",
      "Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s daughter, wrote on X: \u201cI concur concerning my father. Please stop.\u201d King\u2019s famous \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech has been continuously manipulated and remixed on the app.",
      "George Carlin\u2019s daughter said in a BlueSky post that his family was \u201cdoing our best to combat\u201d deepfakes of the late comedian.",
      "Sora-generated videos depicting \u201chorrific violence\u201d involving renowned physicist Stephen Hawking have also surged in popularity this week, with many examples circulating on X.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI told NBC News: \u201cWhile there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, we believe that public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used. For public figures who are recently deceased, authorized representatives or owners of their estate can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos.\u201d",
      "In a blog post from last Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote that the company would soon \u201cgive rightsholders more granular control over generation of characters,\u201d referring to wider types of content. \u201cWe are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of \u2018interactive fan fiction\u2019 and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all).\u201d",
      "OpenAI\u2019s quickly evolving policies for Sora have led some commentators to argue the company\u2019s move fast and break things approach was purposeful, showing users and intellectual-property holders the app\u2019s power and reach.",
      "Liam Mayes, a lecturer at Rice University\u2019s program in media studies, thinks increasingly realistic deepfakes could have two key societal effects. First, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll find trusting people falling victim to all kinds of scams, big, powerful companies exerting coercive pressures and nefarious actors undermining democratic processes,\u201d Mayes said.",
      "At the same time, being unable to discern deepfakes from real video might reduce trust in genuine media. \u201cWe might see trust in all sorts of media establishments and institutions erode,\u201d Mayes said.",
      "As founder and chairman of CMG Worldwide, Mark Roesler has managed the intellectual property and licensing rights for over 3,000 deceased entertainment, sports, historical and music personalities like James Dean, Neil Armstrong and Albert Einstein. Roesler said that Sora is just the latest technology to raise concerns about protecting figures\u2019 legacies.",
      "\u201cThere is and will be abuse as there has always been with celebrities and their valuable intellectual property,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWhen we began representing deceased personalities in 1981, the internet was not even in existence.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew technology and innovation help keep the legacies of many historical, iconic personalities alive, who shaped and influenced our history,\u201d Roesler added, saying that CMG will continue to represent its clients\u2019 interests within AI applications like Sora.",
      "To differentiate between a real and Sora-generated video, OpenAI implemented several tools to help users and digital platforms identify Sora-created content.",
      "Each video includes invisible signals, a visible watermark and metadata \u2014 behind-the-scenes technical information that describes the content as AI-generated.",
      "Yet several of these layers are easily removable, said Sid Srinivasan, a computer scientist at Harvard University. \u201cVisible watermarks and metadata will deter casual misuse through some friction, but they are easy enough to remove and won\u2019t stop more determined actors.\u201d",
      "Srinivasan said an invisible watermark and an associated detection tool would likely be the most reliable approach. \u201cUltimately, video-hosting platforms will likely need access to detection tools like this, and there\u2019s no clear timeline for wider access to such internal tools.\u201d",
      "Wenting Zheng, an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, echoed that view, saying: \u201cTo automatically detect AI-generated materials on social media posts, it would be beneficial for OpenAI to share their tool for tracing images, audio and videos with the platforms to assist people in identifying AI-generated content.\u201d",
      "When asked for specifics about whether OpenAI had shared these detection tools with other platforms like Meta or X, a spokesperson from OpenAI referred NBC News to a general technical report. The report does not provide such detailed information.",
      "To better identify genuine footage, some companies are resorting to AI to detect AI outputs, according to Ben Colman, CEO and co-founder of Reality Defender, a deepfake-detecting startup.",
      "\u201cHuman beings \u2014 even those trained on the problem, as some of our competitors are \u2014 are faulty and wrong, missing the unseeable or unhearable,\u201d Colman said.",
      "At Reality Defender, \u201cAI is used to detect AI,\u201d Colman told NBC News. AI-generated  \u201cvideos may get more realistic to you and I, but AI can see and hear things that we cannot.\u201d",
      "Similarly, McAfee\u2019s Scam Detector software \u201clistens to a video\u2019s audio for AI fingerprints and analyzes it to determine whether the content is authentic or AI-generated,\u201d according to Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at McAfee.",
      "However, Grobman added, \u201cnew tools are making fake video and audio look more real all the time, and 1 in 5 people told us they or someone they know has already fallen victim to a deepfake scam.\u201d",
      "The quality of deepfakes also differs among languages, as current AI tools in commonly used languages like English, Spanish or Mandarin are vastly more capable than tools in less commonly used languages.",
      "\u201cWe are regularly evolving the technology as new AI tools come out, and expanding beyond English so more languages and contexts are covered,\u201d Grobman said.",
      "Concerns about deepfakes have made headlines before. Less than a year ago, many observers predicted that the 2024 elections would be overrun with deepfakes. This largely turned out not to be true.",
      "Until this year, however, AI-generated media, like images, audio and video, has largely been distinguishable from real content. Many commentators have found models released in 2025 to be particularly lifelike, threatening the public\u2019s ability to discern real, human-created information from AI-generated content.",
      "Google\u2019s Veo 3 video-generation model, released in May, was called \u201cterrifyingly accurate\u201d and \u201cdangerously lifelike\u201d at the time, inspiring one reviewer to ask, \u201cAre we doomed?\u201d"

      "Natalie Silva, a high school senior in Massachusetts, wants to play soccer in college, but she is still recovering from a right knee injury during a game over a year ago.",
      "Silva remembers colliding with an opposing player. As she fell, she heard her knee \u201cpop\u201d when her cleats got stuck in the turf on a field where her Uxbridge High School team was playing an away game.",
      "\u201cI was playing on an indoor field where the turf is on top of concrete. If it was grass, there would\u2019ve been more cushion,\u201d claims Silva, 18, who goes to school about 50 miles southwest of Boston. She said she met with her doctor, who was concerned that her cleats were made for playing on grass, not turf. \u201cThe turf 100% played a role in my injury,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The multibillion-dollar artificial turf industry has convinced local governments and school boards that turf fields are a way to save money and increase playing time for young people. As hundreds of synthetic fields and playgrounds are installed at schools, colleges, and public parks in the U.S. every year, stakeholders from lawmakers to school boards and soccer moms are debating claims like Silva\u2019s about the safety of playing on such surfaces.",
      "Boston and Westport, Connecticut, have effectively banned turf that contains rubber from recycled tires due to concerns about exposure to chemicals. Vermont has passed restrictions, and in California, a reversal of a previous decision now allows local communities to impose bans.",
      "Groups like the NFL Players Association, and physical therapists and other clinicians believe playing on turf increases the risk of torn ligaments, sprained ankles, and other injuries.",
      "A study of NFL data released in 2024 found higher incidences of lower-extremity injuries on artificial turf than on natural grass. The odds of a serious injury requiring season-ending surgery were significantly higher, the study said.",
      "\u201cACL and ankle sprains are the main injuries we see from turf,\u201d said HIDEF Physical Therapy founder Zach Smith, who works with athletes in Seattle as they recover from turf-related injuries.",
      "\u201cThe turf provides better grip and more friction,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat for performance, but bad for joints.\u201d",
      "Safety debate mounts",
      "Artificial turf \u2014 first widely introduced in the 1960s at the former domed stadium of Major League Baseball\u2019s Houston Astros \u2014 is made from plastics to mimic the look of grass. It typically contains tiny black pellets called \u201ccrumb rubber,\u201d processed using shredded tires.",
      "By 2020, there were 13,000 synthetic turf sports fields in the U.S., with about 1,500 installed annually, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. Nowadays, young people who participate in sports, from football to field hockey and lacrosse to soccer, are less likely to play on natural grass than on artificial turf, also called synthetic grass, synthetic turf, or astroturf.",
      "The Synthetic Turf Council, a leading industry trade group, did not return calls and emails to answer questions about chemical hazards and injuries. But the industry has pointed to research showing no definitive link between artificial turf and health problems, including sports injuries.",
      "Manufacturers support their product.",
      "\u201cArtificial turf lets kids play safely on a lush, mud-free surface all year long,\u201d said Adam Grossman, chief executive of Southern Turf Co., headquartered in Austin, Texas.",

      "In a January letter to protest a Santa Clara County, California, proposal to ban artificial turf, the president and CEO of the Synthetic Turf Council, Melanie Taylor, said \u201cforever chemicals are ubiquitous in today\u2019s environment, including water, air, soil, and a variety of food products.\u201d",
      "Synthetic turf does not contain more than what\u2019s in other parts of the environment, and it helps communities across the country save money, Taylor said in the letter. \u201cMotions to ban synthetic turf hinder communities\u2019 ability to access these benefits [and] should be reconsidered,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Long-term consequences",
      "Critics of turf dispute the industry\u2019s claims, including those about safety.",
      "The pellets of crumb rubber in turf contain toxic chemicals like petroleum compounds, metals, and lead, according to Stuart Shalat, former director of the Division of Environmental Health at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cWhen fields heat up, they can release fumes or transfer chemicals to skin,\u201d said Shalat, who is now retired. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t yet fully understand the long-term effects, especially for children.\u201d",
      "The Paideia School, a K-12 private school in Atlanta, is switching from grass to turf at Python Park, its off-campus location in Avondale Estates that has two soccer fields and a diamond for baseball and softball.",
      "Janet Metzger, a self-described environmentalist who lives near Python Park, said she tried to persuade the school to cancel the project because she is worried about the impact on nature.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s natural grass, you have insects and life in the soil that keep the area vibrant,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cTurf kills the environment and harms all the species that live there.\u201d",
      "The Paideia School declined an interview request to answer questions about why it is installing turf.",
      "In instituting their restriction on turf fields, government officials in California and Vermont said they were worried about PFAS, which are known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d and other hazardous materials that can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin.",
      "A 2024 federal Environmental Protection Agency report on the crumb rubber in turf found that chemicals associated with tire crumb rubber were in the air, on surfaces, and on the skin of study participants but concluded there were no elevated levels in their bodies. EPA researchers, however, said their study was not designed to assess health risks associated with crumb rubber.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. Consumer Protection Agency has issued recommendations for limiting exposure to crumb rubber recycled tire materials used in playground surfaces, encouraging people to wash their hands and other exposed skin after leaving playgrounds with these surfaces, and to avoid eating and drinking while there.",
      "This year is shaping up to become one of the hottest on record. Turf absorbs heat from the sun and can become much hotter than natural grass, creating a health hazard, according to the Center for Environmental Health.",
      "\u201cOn turf, you get more blisters, turf toe, and turf burns. I\u2019m playing recreational soccer now and dealing with blisters myself,\u201d said Smith, the Seattle physical therapist who specializes in orthopedic injuries and rehabilitation. \u201cTurf gets hot, and when you add sweat and heat, it becomes a dangerous combination.\u201d",
      "Brian Feeley, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of California-San Francisco, said his studies show ACL and Achilles tendon injuries are more likely on turf and more likely to require surgery.",
      "\u201cArtificial turf doesn\u2019t release cleats as easily,\u201d he said. \u201cThat puts more torque and strain on the knees and ankles.\u201d",
      "And Feeley said the long-term consequences can be severe: \u201cAn ACL injury as a young athlete can keep you from playing at the next level and lead to arthritis in your 30s.\u201d",
      "Silva, the injured high school soccer player, said she wishes her games had been played on natural grass. The Uxbridge High School principal\u2019s office and athletic department declined multiple requests to comment.",
      "She vividly recalls the match in February 2024 when she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee.",
      "\u201cI went up to head the ball and landed awkwardly on my right leg,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goalie ran into me at full speed, and my knee popped. I immediately fell to the floor in agony. Every bump in the car ride home made my leg jerk \u2014 it felt detached.\u201d",
      "Before the injury, Silva said, she had hoped to play soccer in college. Now, she is struggling through rehabilitation three times a week and can\u2019t play for a full year.",
      "Asked about her future in soccer, Silva said she doesn\u2019t know what to expect. Right now, she\u2019s just trying to enjoy senior year.",
      "\u201cThe mental side of it is the worst,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThe feeling of one day being able to do everything and the next you can\u2019t walk or even move your leg. The mental aspect of it lasts longer than the pain.\u201d"

    "summary": "As many of the NFL's favorites have wilted over the past month, the Detroit Lions have quietly built one of the best resumes, winning four straight and scoring 34 or more points in every win.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s a distressing time to be a team once considered a preseason Super Bowl contender.",
      "Reigning champion Philadelphia has lost two straight after Thursday\u2019s blowout loss to the Giants. The Baltimore Ravens are 1-4 and star quarterback Lamar Jackson is hurt. The Kansas City Chiefs have their game-breaking quarterback healthy, but are 2-3, having suffered more losses already than all of last season. Buffalo\u2019s 13-game home winning streak was just snapped in a surprise upset. Since Green Bay began talking of going undefeated at 2-0, the Packers have lost one game and tied another.",
      "Cincinnati? Don\u2019t even ask.",
      "The Detroit Lions seemed to be headed toward trouble, too. In Week 1, playing with brand-new defensive and offensive coordinators, an offense that led the league in scoring in 2024 mustered only 13 points in a loss to division rival Green Bay.",
      "As many of the NFL\u2019s favorites have wilted over the past month, though, the Lions have quietly built one of the best cases for Super Bowl contention by winning four straight and scoring 34 or more points in every win.",
      "Even after wunderkind offensive coordinator Ben Johnson left to coach Chicago, the Lions have scored 174 points, the most in franchise history through five games. And despite coordinator Aaron Glenn leaving to coach the Jets, the defense ranks in the top three in sacks, pressures, quarterback hits and forced fumbles. Oddsmakers at DraftKings now peg the Lions\u2019 as the favorite to win the NFC, and have given them the second-best odds to win the Super Bowl, behind only Buffalo.",
      "Parity and drama across the league have drawn attention elsewhere. Seven teams are 4-1, including Indiana, Jacksonville and San Francisco, which missed the playoffs last season. Twenty-five games have come down to a score in the final three minutes of regulation or overtime, the most in NFL history through Week 5, per NBC Sports research.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lions keep ripping off wins.",
      "\u201cThat core group is still intact,\u201d Lions coach Dan Campbell said. \u201cI think the most important thing is you\u2019ve got your culture, you\u2019ve got your identity and you\u2019ve got players that fit into that, and we\u2019ve got that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got players in every pivotal position you can ask for to have success,\u201d Campbell added. \u201cAnd those guys are made the right way, so absolutely, our window is open.\u201d",
      "Skepticism about Detroit (4-1) taking advantage of that title window is expected after it earned the NFC\u2019s top playoff seed last season, setting franchise records for points (564) and tying an NFL record for games with 40-plus points (six) along the way, only to instantly underwhelm in the postseason by losing its playoff opener to Washington, at home.",
      "This season, just like last, injuries have begun to chip away at the Lions\u2019 depth and potential. Three starter-level defensive backs could miss a significant amount of time after recent injuries, Campbell said this week. A shoulder injury sidelined left tackle Taylor Decker last week, and that missing protector on quarterback Jared Goff\u2019s blind side contributed to Goff being sacked four times, after taking zero sacks the previous three weeks combined.",
      "Yet pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson, whose leg injury last season was one of the most devastating to Detroit\u2019s defense, is back, and is again playing like a candidate for defensive player of the year. His team-high five sacks tie for third most in the league.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to have him back, period,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMy gosh ... we missed him last year.\u201d",
      "There were questions about how Goff would fare playing for the first time in his career without an offense directed by either Sean McVay or Johnson, both considered two of the league\u2019s most creative at calling offenses. Johnson, who reveled in mixing in hook-and-ladders, trick plays and throws to offensive linemen, was particularly flashy.",
      "His successor, John Morton, 56, had been an offensive coordinator in the NFL just one other season in his career prior this one. But critically, he had previously coached in Detroit in 2022 and overlapped with Goff then in a different role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said it a million times, the fact that we were together at one point and have a relationship prior to him being my coordinator is extremely important and allows us to kind of speak freely to each other,\u201d Goff said last month.",
      "Goff has thrown for a league-high 12 touchdowns and completed a league-best 75.2% of his passes \u2014 only the second player in NFL history, behind Peyton Manning in 2013, to put up stats like that through five games. (Manning would go on to win MVP that season and lead Denver to a Super Bowl.)",
      "Morton compared the Lions to a Raiders team he coached on that went to a Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe had the best offense in the league\u201d filled with Hall of Famers, Morton said this month when asked to compare Detroit\u2019s options. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only thing that comes to mind, really. But these weapons [here], we can do whatever we want.\u201d",
      "And in a league where the expected contenders have rarely been able to do as they please, it has made Detroit\u2019s start notable.",
      "What we're watching for in Week 6",
      "Broncos (3-2) vs. Jets (0-5): In London, the aforementioned Glenn has yet to win as a head coach, and is facing a Broncos team with a league-leading 21 sacks. New York has started 0-6 only twice in its history.",
      "Cardinals (2-3) at Colts (4-1): Arizona has been snake-bitten, losing three straight games on game-winning field goals in the final seconds. The Colts haven\u2019t turned the ball over in four games.",
      "Chargers (3-2) at Dolphins (1-4): Justin Herbert threw four interceptions last season but has three in his last three games. Miami has won one of its last 15 games against opponents with winning records.",
      "Seahawks (3-2) at Jaguars (4-1): Jacksonville is the best in the league at forcing turnovers (14), while Seattle is the best road team (eight consecutive wins).",
      "Patriots (3-2) at Saints (1-4): If Stefon Diggs collects 100-plus receiving yards for a third straight game this week, he\u2019ll be the first Patriots receiver to do that since Wes Welker in 2012.",
      "Browns (1-4) at Steelers (3-1): Under coach Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh is 14-1 when facing a rookie quarterback at home, per NBC Sports research. Another good omen: Pittsburgh has won eight straight games coming off a bye week.",
      "Cowboys (2-2-1) at Panthers (2-3): Dak Prescott needs 150 passing yards to pass Troy Aikman for the second-most passing yards in team history, and a win would move him past Tony Romo into third all time in franchise history for wins.",
      "Rams (3-2) at Ravens (1-4): Baltimore\u2019s defense will have to tighten after allowing 35-plus points in each of its last four games. The Ravens have allowed a league-high 13 passing touchdowns.",
      "Titans (1-4) at Raiders (1-4): No team has completed a lower percentage of its passes this year than the Titans (51.8%).",
      "Bengals (2-3) at Packers (2-1-1): Green Bay is one of two teams (Buffalo) whose defense has yet to allow a big play of 40-plus yards. And it has allowed a league-low six plays of 20-plus yards. Cincinnati is starting QB Joe Flacco after trading for him this week.",
      "49ers (4-1) at Buccaneers (4-1): Tampa rookie wideout Emeka Egbuka ranks fourth with 445 receiving yards, and his average of 17.8 yards per catch ranks fourth among qualified receivers.",
      "Lions (4-1) at Chiefs (3-2): If Patrick Mahomes throws for one touchdown Sunday, he\u2019ll become the fastest quarterback to reach 300 for a career, beating Aaron Rodgers by eight games.",
      "Bills (4-1) at Falcons (2-2) on Monday: Bijan Robinson\u2019s 146 scrimmage yards per game lead the NFL. Buffalo\u2019s Josh Allen has a turnover in each of his last two games after zero turnovers in his previous eight games.",
      "Bears (2-2) at Commanders (3-2) on Monday: Chicago has won its last two games but is 1-9 coming off a bye since 2015."

When you\u2019re both doing the same job, it\u2019s not so great. I should have found just a nice human being, kind of a family guy.\u201d",

He\u2019s optimistic, he has all these dreams and plans when he gets out.\u201d",

      "Is \"Roofman\" Based on a True Story?",
      "\"Roofman\" is based on Manchester's life, starting with a robbery at a McDonald's in May 2000, according to the Charlotte Observer, which obtained newspaper archives, court documents and interviews with those close to the case.",
      "Manchester carved a hole in the roof of the McDonald's in Belmont, North Carolina, and ordered the workers to lie on the ground as he told another to open the safe \u2014 while holding a .22 caliber rifle.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re the good people,\u201d Manchester reportedly told the employees, according to the Observer. \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy. I\u2019m sorry for doing this to you.\u201d",

      "The officer turned on his lights, called for backup and eventually police apprehended him after a brief chase. And about two hours later, Manchester confessed.",
      "The Observer reported Manchester, who had recently divorced from the mother of his three children, told police he did it for the money, \u201cto pay bills and buy things for my kids.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will do everything I can do to fix the situation. I still have a lot to give the community and the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be quick cash, and I ended up scaring people and wasted the police\u2019s time as well, and I am sorry for that.\u201d",
      "Authorities in California suspected Manchester was behind more than 40 other robberies in the state and others, as his military assignments would put him near the locations.",
      "Manchester told police in North Carolina he \u201cgot the idea from news of similar circumstances\u201d in California, and that he had \u201cnever done anything like this before, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Manchester was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering and eight counts of first-degree kidnapping, and he was held him on a $1 million bond, according to the Observer.",
      "He turned down a plea deal that would have let him serve 15 to 22 years in prison, and was later convicted of the charges, the Observer reported. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.",
      "But after serving just four years in prison, he escaped in June 2004 by hiding underneath a truck that took him beyond the prison walls, the Observer reported.",
      "Manchester then hitched rides to bring him to Charlotte, where he would make a home inside of a Toys R Us, per the Observer. An employee eventually found his makeshift home behind a false wall in the store, though Manchester would later just move into a different part of the store.",

      "But on Dec. 26, 2004, he robbed the Toys R Us he had been living in, and when officers started investigating, they found a secret passageway that led them to the abandoned Circuit City next door, where they found a living space similar to the ones they found in the toy store, according to the Observer.",
      "Investigators found a fingerprint in the space, which was a match for Manchester, who had escaped from the state prison months before, per the Observer. They started showing Manchester's mugshot to people in the area, and on Jan. 5, 2005, they showed his photo at Crossroads Church to Wainscott.",
      "\u201cMiss Wainscott, the man that you\u2019ve been dating is not who you think he is,\u201d investigators told her, according to the Observer. \u201cHe\u2019s an escaped convict. He\u2019s considered extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "They showed her Manchester's mug shot on America's Most Wanted, and she later helped investigators catch him.",
      "Manchester was set to take Wainscott out for dinner that night, as it was her birthday, and she called him to confirm he was picking her up, per the Observer. As investigators tailed his car, he stopped at a Bi-Lo grocery store to pick up flowers.",
      "Once he was at Wainscott's door, the tactical unit swarmed, and Manchester surrendered, according to the Observer.",
      "Authorities said they were able to connect him with other prior robberies at Toys R Us, as well as a break-in at a pawn shop and an arson at a dentist's office, according to the Observer.",
      "\u201cKnowing what we know now about him, how crafty and skilled (he was), I think he enjoyed the chase,\u201d Leigh told the Observer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the money. ... I think he enjoyed eluding the police and being sneaky and seeing what he could get away with.\u201d",
      "Where is Jeffrey Manchester Now?",
      "Manchester is currently imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction, where he's serving time for kidnapping and other counts.",

I just felt a tingling kind of sensation. And that\u2019s when I yelled to Alex. I\u2019m like, 'Guys, I think this thing just bit me!'\"",
      "Latimer recalled that \"cameras hauled it up the beach\" to film the  scene as it grew increasingly \u201cchaotic.\u201d",
      "The 36-year-old Canadian was rushed to the show\u2019s base camp where he was put on a stretcher and given an oxygen mask as the show\u2019s medical staff treated him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when it gets real, man. Because I don\u2019t remember who, but somebody did tell me that that was a very venomous snake and I need to get care, like, now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I was lying on that stretcher, man, you saw me say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a dad\u2026\u2019\u201d",
      "Latimer recalled thinking in that moment, \u201cAm I ever going to get off this island? Am I again going to see my child? Ever am I going to meet my child? And that\u2019s when it sunk in, because I had tubes coming out of me. I had oxygen masks on.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat has been the most scared I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. When you think that you\u2019re dying, it\u2019s a feeling that I\u2019m never going to forget.\u201d",
      "The show's medical professionals were able to determine that the Latimer had sustained  a \u201cdry bite,\u201d which meant the snake released no venom into him.",
      "Still, the decision was made to remove Latimer from the game to allow him time to rest and recover.",
      "\"I can\u2019t even explain that feeling of I\u2019m not going to die. I\u2019m not going to die. And then it\u2019s like, 'OK, now I got to get back in this game. I got to go help my tribe with a challenge,'\" he recalled, adding, \"I did not think I was going to get pulled.\"",
      "Latimer told EW he reluctantly followed \"doctor's orders,\" and could \"respect\" their decision.",
      "\"But I have unfinished business out there, and it was a tough way to go,\" he added.",
      "The silver lining? Latimer made it home in time to see the birth of his son, Jax \u2014 that is, after he was airlifted to a hospital Brisbane, Australia, where additional doctors could examine him.",
      "\"I was there not for very long, and I have a couple of sisters who live there,\" he shared. \"I was able to be with them for an afternoon, and I flew home. I got home just under 48 hours before my kid was born.\"",
      "\"God works in mysterious ways. I think that God put that snake there for a reason, just to get me home,\" he said. \"And I hate saying that because I wanted that game so bad, but I also got to see the birth of Jax, and that\u2019s worth a million dollars. And I was there for my wife.\"",
      "\"So it\u2019s a blessing in disguise. I\u2019m (otherwise) never going to get that experience back of seeing my kid be born,\" he said, adding, \"Even though, like I said, I have unfinished business out there.\"",
      "Latimer previously opened up about his decision to go on the show and miss the birth of his firstborn child in an interview with EW.",
      "\u201cI gave her the option for me to bow out,\u201d Latimer said at the time. \u201cI said, \u2018This is our child. You\u2019re here alone.\u2019 She\u2019s Australian, so she doesn\u2019t have anyone up in Canada. But she says, \u2018No, you go out. This is your dream, go do it, and whatever money you make is mine.\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cHonestly, it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he continued.",

      "\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy how people can make a situation so big and out or proportion when all I was doing was following the rules,\u201d Chiles wrote on her story.",
      "The second moment Sosa addressed came after Sosa and Chiles made it to the next round. He lifted her up and, after a beat, she said, \u201cOK, you can put me down now.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor those of you who don\u2019t know Jordan and my dynamic, it is very much brother and sister. When that moment happened, I didn\u2019t think much of it. I thought it was hysterical,\u201d Sosa said.",
      "He then spoke about the tenor of the comments, which were getting \u201cworse and worse and worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can talk your negative stuff about me and I can handle it like a champ but when it comes to my partner, I\u2019m going to feel a certain way about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly the thing that hurts me the most is knowing the person that she is and knowing the time that we have together.\u201d",
      "Sosa appeared to tear up as he called her a \u201cremarkable person\u201d and said he is \u201cso grateful\u201d she came into his life.",
      "Sosa ended his video with food for thought for fans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re allowed to be our own individual selves. Sometimes our dynamic may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it is certainly mine,\u201d Sosa said.",
      "Elaine Hendrix, who is competing on the season, shared her support in the comments. \u201cHaters are always gonna find something to hate. You two are incredible. And Jordan is amazing. She\u2019s also fierce! No apologies needed for that. Love you both,\u201d she wrote."

      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Guinness\u201d is a Netflix hit. But how does the real Guinness family feel about the historical drama, based on their family\u2019s history?",
      "The show, which recounts the rise of the Irish brewery, shows a fictionalized version of what happened when Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, grandson of Guinness founder Arthur Guinness, died and left his fortune to his kids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the extraordinary story of a family who happens to be the inheritors of the biggest brewery in the world,\u201d series creator Steven Knight told Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum in an interview.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young and are given the task of taking on this incredibly successful brand. The first priority is: Don\u2019t screw it up. And the second priority is to make Guinness even bigger.\u201d",
      "Since the story takes place in the 1800s, Knight said he couldn\u2019t access many details about his characters\u2019 pasts. Given the limited information, Knight told Tudum he filled in the blanks with a made-for-TV story.",
      "\u201cWhat I had to do is take things that these family members did, things that they said, achievements they made, mistakes that they made, and use them as stepping stones,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I had to fill in the gaps myself. It\u2019s just a question of saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the character that I imagine this person is. This is why they did that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the show's release, a few Guinness family descendants have weighed in. Descendant Ivana Lowell, who produced the show, estimated there are about 100 Guinness family members while speaking to Vanity Fair.",
      "Lowell told the New York Times the idea came to her while staying with \"many\" Guinness relatives in Leixlip, a town in Ireland.",
      "\u201cWe were halfheartedly watching \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 and I thought, \u2018Oh, our family is so much more interesting and eccentric,'\" she said.",

      "Ultimately, Lowell said the show turned out to be a more \u201cgritty\u201d version of \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d Though she said she was \u201cnervous\u201d about what her family would say, she said she knew that they had a \u201cgood sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Then, other Guinness members publicly weighed in. In a first-person essay for The Times, Molly Guinness, great-great-great-granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, said she laughed when she saw the show\u2019s first two episodes with her cousin, who has a \u201cfirmer grip\u201d on what happened long ago.",

      "Molly Guinness noted that the series will definitely become a \u201cuseful GIF\u201d on her sibling\u2019s WhatsApp group.",
      "However, she said she wasn\u2019t pleased with how the drama portrayed Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness and Arthur Guinness as \u201cknaves and fools.\u201d",
      "\u201cBenjamin was a loving father and a great philanthropist,\u201d she said.",
      "She also approved of how the show displayed her family\u2019s charity work, although \"every charitable project is filmed through a lens of shame or self-preservation.\u201d",
      "Despite the show provoking \"righteous fury,\" Molly Guinness did say she was looking forward to watching it with her brother and cousins. \"The prospect of the laughter of all my brothers and cousins once they get their hands on it is a real joy,\" she said."

      "Prior to the Oct. 4 Season 51 premiere of the late-night sketch comedy series, a slew of cast members announced their departure from the show, with some sharing their candid thoughts on their seemingly abrupt exit.",
      "Among those leaving ahead of the new season are Heidi Gardner, who made her debut in 2017; Michael Longfellow, who joined the show in 2022; Devon Walker, who had a three-year run; and Emil Wakim, who only served as featured player on the program for one year.",
      "Following those departures, \u201cSNL\u201d shared in a Sept. 2 update that Please Don\u2019t Destroy group comedian Ben Marshall, as well as Veronika Slowikowska, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Tommy Brennan, would join the show as this season as featured players.",
      "Less than two week laters, a shock came to fans when Ego Nwodim, who many thought was already confirmed for the new season, announced she would officially be leaving \u201cSNL\u201d after seven seasons.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,\u201d she wrote in part in an Instagram post Sept. 12.",
      "Nwodim, who began as a featured player on \u201cSNL\u201d in 2018 and then joined the main cast two years later, was one of the mainstays of the series, and notably one of the only eight Black women to have served as cast members in the series\u2019 50-year history.",
      "With Nwodim's departure, \"SNL\" now has no Black women cast members. After Rudolph left \"SNL\" in 2007, the show went seven years without a Black woman cast member, a streak that ended when Sasheer Zamata joined in 2014.",
      "When asked about the aforementioned cast shakeups and departures, Rudolph, who was an \u201cSNL\u201d cast member from 2000 to 2007, tells TODAY.com \u201cit was inevitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like every few years there\u2019s definitely a change. And I felt like it was inevitable. I mean, some people have been there for a really long time,\u201d she says before clarifying that she was not referencing Kenan Thompson, who\u2019s been a cast member for 22 years, making him the longest-tenured cast member in the show\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m never surprised,\u201d she continues while also noting that she\u2019s a little out of the loop. \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors anymore. Obviously, when you work there, you have the ins and outs. But I just find out about it like everybody else.\u201d",
      "While Rudolph later quips that she has to get the scoop from Nwodim about her departure, she acknowledges that much has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cWhen I was starting out, I was doing improv and sketch comedy at The Groundlings, which is still a wonderful theater and such a great place to start, because it\u2019s a place where you can get on stage and actually create characters and work, work, work,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just like such an important training ground.\u201d",
      "Rudolph says it was a different time then, before the advent of social media and people putting their content on the internet. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that ability then,\u201d she explains.",
      "But the amount of effort and the work is still the same. \u201cI feel like practicing and doing and doing and doing and constantly doing and finding other funny people is the key,\u201d she continues, \u201cand just writing and performing and creating your own body of work.\u201d",
      "As far as who makes it on the show and how to land that coveted spot? The \"Loot\" star says it\u2019s really a mixed bag.",
      "\u201cThere are so many different types of people at 'SNL.' I\u2019m a sketch performer. Some people come to it as stand ups \u2014 just stand ups and \u2014 that\u2019s a whole other being that thrives there and then some people are just impersonators,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cThere are so many different paths to get there. But I think creating and creating and creating and being a part of something, whether you\u2019re a stand up or whether you\u2019re a part of a group, I think is so important to just stay active and be seen as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Though Rudolph has not divulged whether fans will see her again on the new season, it\u2019s safe to say the door remains open for the award-winning performer who nabbed an Emmy in 2020 for her portrayal of Vice President Kamala Harris on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the case of Kamala, there was nothing to do but do it,\u201d she says.",
      "But there are some people she\u2019s just not interested in impersonating.",
      "\u201cThere have been other people, I think, definitely in the past, where I thought, \u2018Oh, God, I don\u2019t want to dress up like that lady' ... I feel like, if someone\u2019s a monster in real life, I definitely don\u2019t want to play them because I think somehow I don\u2019t want to totally be associated,\u201d she explains.",
      "As Rudolph gears up for her own projects, including the third season of her hit Apple TV+ series \u201cLoot,\u201d the comedian says she\u2019ll always have a soft spot for \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes strange not being on the show, because you feel like, \u201cOh, if I were there, I would really, I would really have fun doing that,\u201d she says.",

      "Gein became known as \"The Butcher of Plainfield,\" making the town of about 700 people at the time a curiosity after his crimes made national headlines. The fate of his home then later became the subject of speculation about its destruction.",
      "Here's what to know about the farmhouse in Plainfield.",
      "What Was Found in Ed Gein's House?",
      "A local sheriff and a captain from a nearby sheriff department searched the house in 1957 and discovered a scene that left them reeling.",
      "The home was littered with garbage and had roaches and rodents scurrying about in a filthy kitchen.",
      "They then discovered the decapitated and gutted body of a missing local woman, Bernice Worden, hanging in the home, which they initially thought was a deer carcass, according to the book \"Unhinged: The Shocking True Story of Ed Gein,\" by Robert Keller. Gein later confessed to killing Worden.",
      "They also found a soup bowl that was made out of the top half of a human skull, as well as skulls hanging from the posts of Gein's bed. Gein later told investigators he exhumed the corpses of women from a local cemetery.",
      "Another horrifying discovering was a chair upholstered with human skin, as well as items like lampshades, a drum and a knife sheath made from human skin. They also found a collection of female genitalia, a box of human noses and death masks of skin pulled from victims' skulls and stuffed with paper and sawdust. One of them belonged to local innkeeper Mary Hogan, whom Gein confessed to killing after she had gone missing three years earlier.",
      "There also were odd discoveries like a coffee can filled with used chewing gum, a collection of old dentures and a washbasin filled with sand, according to Keller's book.",
      "Gein kept one area of the house sealed off and pristine \u2014 the bedroom of his late mother, Augusta Gein. His deep attachment to the severe and domineering Augusta, who died in 1945, is a persistent theme in \"Monster\" and Gein's life.",
      "Her room was filled with dust but otherwise was perfectly neat because it was left in the same state as the day she died from a stroke.",
      "Where Was Ed Gein's House?",
      "The isolated farmhouse was located on a 195-acre plot of land in Plainfield, Wisconsin, which was six miles from the nearest village via a dirt road.",
      "Plainfield's population at the time of his arrest was about 700 people. The town is located 155 miles northwest of Milwaukee and about 90 miles north of Madison.",
      "How Long Did Ed Gein Live in the Farmhouse?",
      "The Gein family initially lived in La Crosse, Wisconsin, before moving to a small dairy farm.",
      "In 1914, they purchased the 195-acre farmland that included a modest, two-story house that became more dilapidated as time went by due to the family's struggles with money.",
      "Ed and his older brother, Henry Gein, lived there with Augusta and their father, George Gein. George struggled with alcohol and was routinely berated and belittled by Augusta.",
      "George died in 1940 and then Ed's brother, Henry, died in 1944 under mysterious circumstances surrounding a wildfire on property near their home. There was suspicion that Henry Gein was Ed Gein's first victim.",
      "Gein continued to live in the Plainfield house with his mother, nursing her to health after she had a stroke following his brother's death. She then had another stroke and died in 1945.",
      "Gein then lived in the farmhouse alone, descending into madness while working odd jobs for money, until he was arrested in 1957. He was 51 years old at the time and had lived in the home for nearly his entire life.",
      "What Happened to the Home after Ed Gein Was Arrested?",
      "Following the news reports about Gein's crimes, the home became a tourist attraction. Morbidly curious people were driving from all over Wisconsin to see the crumbling old home, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "After Gein was found to be insane and committed to the former Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Wisconsin, an auction was scheduled to sell his belongings as well as the farm.",
      "Before the auction took place, the Plainfield fire department was called to the site of the farmhouse on March 20, 1958, to find it burning.",
      "\"The firemen stood impassively by as the building burned to the ground,\" Keller wrote in \"Unhinged.\"",
      "It was believed to be arson, but the fire warden, who was the son of Gein's victim Bernice Worden, did not launch an inquiry.",
      "Gein was told while in the hospital about the destruction of a home that his family had owned for 44 years.",
      "\"Just as well,\" he said with little emotion, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "The property containing the destroyed home was sold for $3,000, and the 1949 Ford he used to transport bodies he had exhumed from the cemetery sold for $760 to a sideshow operator named Bunny Gibbons. He toured the Midwest with the vehicle, charging 25 cents for people to sit in the \"ghoul car,\" according to Keller."

    "summary": "There are still lingering questions about what Trump's 20-point plan will mean for the future of the Gaza Strip.",
    "story": [
      "With a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip apparently in effect and large numbers of Palestinians moving north as the Israeli army retreated Friday, significant questions lingered over what was next for President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace.",
      "Trump has said that he plans to travel to Egypt for an official signing ceremony for the ceasefire agreement and that he has also been invited to address the Israeli parliament, or Knesset.",
      "Here's what we know, and don't know, about what comes next.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposed plan",
      "Key components of Trump's proposal include:",
      "The release of all living and dead hostages in Gaza within 72 hours of Israel accepting the agreement.Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life-sentence prisoners, plus 1,700 Palestinians detained after Oct. 7, 2023.A requirement for Hamas to lay down its arms, and a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory.The delivery of humanitarian aid and the installation of a civilian governing authority for Palestinians.",

      "Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life-sentence prisoners, plus 1,700 Palestinians detained after Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "A requirement for Hamas to lay down its arms, and a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory.",
      "The delivery of humanitarian aid and the installation of a civilian governing authority for Palestinians.",
      "Now what?",
      "A ceasefire in Gaza came into effect Friday at 12 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) and troops have pulled back to agreed lines, the Israeli military said, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government approved the first phase of the deal intended to bring the war to an end.",
      "A 72-hour window is now open in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages. The White House has said it expected hostages to be released Monday. Forty-eight hostages remain to be returned, of whom Israel says it believes 20 are alive.",
      "An Israeli official briefed on the matter told NBC News that all living hostages would be released at one time.",
      "In exchange, Israel is to release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Palestinians detained after Oct. 7, 2023. A final list of prisoners has not yet been made public, but an Israeli government spokeswoman said Thursday it would not include the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, seen by many as a potential unifying figure.",
      "The U.S. military is preparing to deploy up to 200 troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The agreement comes just more than two years to the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and around 250 kidnapped. Since then, Israel has killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Gaza's future?",
      "The first phase of Trump\u2019s plan does not address Gaza\u2019s medium- and long-term future. With most of Gaza\u2019s buildings damaged or destroyed in Israel\u2019s offensive, according to the United Nations, and its population largely forced from their homes, what comes next is an urgent question.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \u201ctechnocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\u201d overseen by a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.",
      "That is until the Palestinian Authority, which controls part of the occupied West Bank and is the Palestinians\u2019 main representative internationally, can be \u201creformed,\u201d according to the plan.",
      "Meanwhile, Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange but has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s proposal.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that Germany will make 29 million euros ($25 million) available for humanitarian assistance and plans to co-host, along with Egypt, a reconstruction conference for Gaza. He said Germany was also \"prepared to assume responsibility in the Council of Peace proposed by President Trump.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "The public push to make Donald Trump the winner of the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize began within hours of the committee\u2019s announcement Friday that the honoree this year is Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader.",
      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

      "The video was released on World Mental Health Day to highlight suicide prevention efforts. The Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019 Royal Foundation is launching a new National Suicide Prevention Network, aiming to bring charities together to transform suicide prevention in the U.K. Manning\u2019s charity 2Wish will be part of the network. According to statistics cited in the video, someone in the U.K. dies by suicide every 90 minutes.",
      "\u201cI will forever go over those last few days with him wondering what I missed,\" Mannings says about her Paul's suicide. \"We were just so happy and I think this just shows it really can happen to anyone.\u201d",
      "William, the heir to the throne, asked Mannings what she would say to her late husband if she could.",

And I think that\u2019s what the hardest thing is, we would have been OK,\u201d Mannings tells William, who then becomes visibly emotional.",
      "\"Are you OK?\" Mannings asks the prince, who takes time to gather himself before continuing. \"It's hard to ask these questions,\" William says.",
      "\u201cThe best way to prevent suicide is to talk about it. Talk about it early, talk about it with your loved ones, those you trust, your friends,\u201d William says."

      "The Israeli government approved the first part of the peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza, after a brutal two-year war that has ravaged the Palestinian enclave and sparked a global outcry, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Friday local time.",
      "\u201cThe government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages \u2014 the living and the deceased,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours.",
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to travel to Egypt for an official signing of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that hostages will be released \u201con Monday or Tuesday.\u201d",
      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",
      "The U.S. troops will stay in Israel, where they will support logistics, transportation, engineering and planning, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "While the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared imminent, explosions were seen and heard in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.",
      "Trump said Wednesday on social media that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "Trump told reporters that while the administration knows where most of the hostages believed to be alive are, finding the bodies of deceased hostages could be a \u201cbigger problem.\u201d",
      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

      "A senior Arab negotiator directly involved in the talks told NBC News on Monday, \"A deal will happen if President Trump keeps pushing.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio was cooler, telling NBC News\u2019 \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that finding a resolution would take \"some time\" and that \"there\u2019s some work that remains to be done.\"",
      "It came as Israel said it deported 171 activists, including the campaigner Greta Thunberg, who sailed toward Gaza on an aid flotilla. The detainees, whose vessels were boarded by Israeli military personnel, were deported to Greece and Slovakia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
      "The first phase of the talks will deal with the release of the remaining 48 hostages, some 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "The plan also calls for the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas agreed to some of this proposal Friday, while sidestepping Trump\u2019s call for it to disband and disarm.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi denied as baseless reports in Arab media that the group had agreed to lay down its weapons.",
      "Israel says it agrees with the plan, buoying the yearslong, impassioned domestic campaign by families and supporters of the hostages to cease fighting so they can be brought home.",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was released in February, having been kidnapped from kibbutz Be\u2019eri, in southern Israel, and held captive for 491 days. On Sunday, he showed NBC News the place where he was taken on Oct. 7.",
      "\"When we were down there\" in the deep Gaza tunnel where he was held, he said he was told \"many times there was a deal in the air,\" he said. \"We were very happy and on a high, then they say, 'no it\u2019s collapsed' and we were very depressed.\"",
      "Still, Netanyahu faces pressure from his own government over negotiations. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on X that stopping attacks on Gaza would be a \u201cgrave mistake.\"",
      "In Gaza, many Palestinians are desperate for an end to the bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Some 78% of buildings have either been damaged or destroyed.",
      "The prospect of an agreement has not stopped the Israeli attacks. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Government Media Office said Sunday that Israel had carried out 131 airstrikes on Gaza over the past 48 hours, killing 94 Palestinians.",
      "Israel launched the offensive after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack, in which some 1,200 were killed and another 250 kidnapped.",
      "Though freeing the hostages would be a \u201csignificant achievement and a fulfillment of a principal war objective,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir warned his troops to be ready.",
      "\u201cThe operation is not over; we must remain alert and ready for combat at all times,\u201d he said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIf the political effort does not succeed, we will return to fight.\u201d"

      "A trio of scientists \u2014 two of them American and one Japanese \u2014 have won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, a mechanism by which the body helps prevent itself from attacking its own tissues instead of foreign invaders.",
      "Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi will share the prize for discoveries that \"launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases,\u201d the Nobel Assembly said in a news release. The trio will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million).",
      "\"This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials,\" it added.",
      "Autoimmune diseases can be triggered when T cells, our body's primary defense mechanism against harmful pathogens, malfunction.",
      "Together, the trio's discoveries lay a crucial foundation for understanding another way our immune system keeps itself in check, known as peripheral tolerance \u2014 a key to understanding why some people suffer from certain autoimmune diseases while others don't.",
      "To prevent damage, our body tries to eliminate malfunctioning T cells in a lymphoid organ in the chest, called the thymus, through a process known as central tolerance, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The discovery began in 1995, when Sakaguchi, a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan, found a previously unknown class of immune cells that protect against autoimmune diseases.",
      "Six years later, in 2001, Mary Brunkow, now a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, along with Ramsdell, now a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, discovered the specific genetic mutation that results in a severe autoimmune disease called IPEX.",
      "They named the gene Foxp3.",
      "In 2003, Sakaguchi was able to prove that it is, in fact, the Foxp3 gene that governs the development of the cells he had identified nearly a decade earlier. These cells are now known as regulatory T cells, and their job is to monitor other T cells and ensure they don't go awry.",
      "\u201cTheir discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\u201d said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "Announcing the award, Thomas Perlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel Committee, said he was able to reach only Sakaguchi on Monday morning.",
      "\"I got hold of him at his lab, and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,\" Perlmann said, adding that Sakaguchi said he had left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who founded the awards to recognize those who have contributed the most to humankind. The first award was presented in 1901, on the fifth anniversary of his death.",
      "The announcement of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was made in Stockholm at the Karolinska Institute on Monday and will be followed by the physics prize on Tuesday, the chemistry prize on Wednesday and the literature prize on Thursday.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday."

      "Chinese rescuers were on Monday rushing to evacuate hundreds of hikers stranded on the eastern slope of the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest, after heavy snowfall blanketed campsites over the weekend.",
      "Nearly 350 hikers have already traveled to safety at a rendezvous point in the small township of Qudang, according to state broadcaster CCTV, with rescuers also in contact with more than 200 hikers remaining who \u201cwill gradually arrive at the rendezvous point.\u201d",
      "Local news outlets had initially reported that nearly 1,000 people had been affected by the blizzard.  Local rescue officials were not immediately available for comment on the discrepancy in numbers.",
      "No casualties were reported, according to local media.",
      "\u201cAbout one-third into the trek, it began to rain and the rain kept getting heavier,\u201d Chen Geshuang, a 28-year-old astrophotographer who began climbing Saturday afternoon but decided to retreat Sunday, told NBC News in an online video interview.",
      "\u201cLater, it turned into sleet, and eventually a full-on blizzard.\u201d",
      "Some hikers shoveled snow out of their tents amid the blizzard, while others waded in a line through the snowstorm in poor visibility, social media videos verified by NBC News showed.",
      "The hikers had been trapped at nearly 16,000 feet, according to a report in Jimu News, which added that local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to clear the roads blocked by snow.",

      "Within hours, some of Chen\u2019s team were exhibiting signs of mild hypothermia and cold stress, she said. By Saturday night, the storm intensified with lightning almost every minute.",
      "\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we woke up this morning, the snow was extremely deep \u2014 about 1 meter, reaching up to our thighs.\u201d",
      "The group decided to retreat, arriving at the foot of the mountain Sunday evening. Neighboring Nepal was also hit with heavy rainfall, where at least 44 people were killed from landslides and floods.",
      "The severe weather event occurred as more than 299 million people were expected to travel regionally Sunday due to a weeklong national holiday that included China's National Day last week and the Mid-Autumn Festival on Monday, CCTV said in a separate report.",
      "Ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended late Saturday, according to notices on the official WeChat accounts of the local Tingri County Tourism Co.",
