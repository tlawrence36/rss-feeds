      "The Feb. 22 closing event will pay homage to the city of Verona \u2014 which is a UNESCO world heritage site \u2014 and the Arena\u2019s role as the venue for a famous summer opera festival, while celebrating athletic excellence and addressing climate change, said Alfredo Accatino, artistic director for the closing ceremony.",
      "\u201cIf the climate continues to change, there won\u2019t be Winter Olympics anymore,\u2019\u2019 Accatino lamented.",
      "The central stage within the nearly 2,000-year-old Arena will be shaped like a waterdrop, symbolically uniting the mountain venues with the fertile Po River Valley, where Milan and Verona are located, and the Venetian lagoon, Accatino said.",
      "Bolle, who performed at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, is a familiar sight at the Arena, where he travels each summer with his \u201cRoberto Bolle and Friends\u201d annual gala. He is the only talent announced so far.",
      "The 2026 Winter Games (Feb. 6-22) will be the first with two official host cities, Milano in Lombardy and Cortina in the Dolomites of Veneto. The opening and closing ceremonies will also be held in two different cities: Milan and Verona",

      "\"This will be a great advertisement for Verona,\" Malag\u00f2 said. \u201cIt is quite obvious that the atmosphere will be completely different from a sports stadium. There is a lot of curiosity to come here.\u201d",
      "Centrally located among the far-flung Olympic venues, Verona is shaping up to be a base for many Olympic visitors, not just a destination for the Feb. 22 closing ceremony, Mayor Damiano Tommasi said, citing hotel reservation trends.",
      "Verona is about an hour and 15 minutes by train from Milan, where ice sports are being held, and is just over three hours by car to Bormio, the venue for men\u2019s downhill, and about the same to Cortina, where women\u2019s downhill, curling and bobsled will be held.",
      "Organizers said they were still finalizing the number of tickets to be sold for the closing ceremony. The Arena di Verona typically holds about 15,000 spectators during opera season, but the closing ceremony capacity will be lower because the central stage will be expanded and many seats are reserved for athletes and official delegations",

      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "Joachim Trier's \u201cSentimental Value\" builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life",
      "NEW YORK -- Joachim Trier, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Renate Reinsve have gathered in a backstage room at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall. A screen on the wall shows the crowd inside, raptly watching their film, \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d They have all consciously sat facing away from the movie.",
      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

      "REINSVE: Before I worked with Joachim, I played a lot of characters that keep their emotions really inside and aren\u2019t able to let them out. Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to. Joachim sits there and knows what the actor wants to do and he says, \u201cLet yourself do it.\u201d It feels like we\u2019re doing it together.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019ve always seen acting as a way of being able to do what you can\u2019t do in your private life. I\u2019m pretty reserved, in a way. I am!",
      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",
      "SKARSGARD: But it\u2019s fantastic to have this art where you can also test everything. Can I feel that? Wow! Yeah! It\u2019s like a child playing in a sandbox. It\u2019s the same mechanism. They play other people from day one. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionary: mimicking the adults to survive.",
      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort. They sing a strange, sensual love song in a band and they\u2019re shy that their parents will hear it. Or you write a book that\u2019s transgressive. I'm the opposite. I\u2019m rather proud that I've done personal films because my kids will see them. Maybe they\u2019ll see them and think they\u2019re stupid or my opinions are weird. That\u2019s OK, but they were me. I think this film came out of a climate in my life when I was thinking about these things.",
      "TRIER: That was when I knew I had the film I wanted to make, when I had the idea of ending. We were all nervous about it. The last day of the shoot. I\u2019m so proud of you two. My dream came true.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019m glad that you say I have a rhythm because I really care about rhythm. Scenes are to me like music pieces. He wrote this for me and the (expletive) and he\u2019s seen what I\u2019ve been longing for: the acting between the lines. (Skarsg\u00e5rd begins tearing up.) I\u2019m getting emotional.",
      "TRIER: I think you are incredibly smart with screenwriting, so much so that I was nervous going in. You\u2019re very blunt in a very warm way. You say \u201c(Expletive) this\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need this.\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: It's being allowed to do a film that\u2019s not written in a head of a director. He\u2019s exploring it. There\u2019s nothing like it. (Again Skarsg\u00e5rd gets emotional before shaking his head.) Enough!",
      "REINSVE: This is it. I feel this moment is it. It brings to the surface something we're longing for. The human mind needs to create a narrative and make things black or white to protect itself. That\u2019s a problem in the world, being so polarized. The wisdom is being safe enough to create a space to let anything happen and see the nuances between people. There are no sets like Joachim\u2019s sets. It's a process \u2014 what is it?

      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

      "___",
      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",
      "His death echoed the suicide of G\u00f6ring, who 12 years earlier had taken a cyanide pill he\u2019d hidden in his cell. G\u00f6ring\u2019s life ended in secret, Kelley\u2019s in front of his family. After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "During a recent interview with The Associated Press, El-Hai spoke of Kelley's findings, the parallels between Kelley and G\u00f6ring and why he believes the story resonates now. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual. I know movies are a different medium from books and that what makes a book good is not the same as what makes a movie good. And so what we\u2019ve ended up with in \u201cNuremberg,\u201d I think, is a movie that is mostly factual, and more important, delivers the messages that are very close to the messages in my book.",
      "Douglas Kelley\u2019s message was that Nazism, fascism, or whatever you want to call it, has always had the potential for coming alive in our country. He saw it immediately when he came back from Europe, and it\u2019s certainly easier to find now.",

      "The seventh \u201cPredator\u201d film takes the franchise to new places by sticking its two stars together",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a long-established cinema subgenre: two opposed people reluctantly stuck together with a common purpose.",
      "The film, the seventh in the franchise (not counting the \u201cAlien vs. Predator\u201d offshoots), has the buddy comedy energy that comes with that dynamic. It also belongs to the narrower subgenre of people quite literally stuck together, like 1958's \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis were fugitives united by chains.",
      "And, in a scenario that provided special challenges for stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a still narrower subset it may share only with \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d: movies with a broken android worn like a backpack by a tall and powerful creature as they face peril in a strange corner of space.",
      "\u201cThe real physical inspiration for it was C-3PO strapped to Chewbacca\u2019s back,\u201d director Dan Trachtenberg told The Associated Press in an interview where he was joined by the film's two stars. \u201cBut I think the fun of this is that it\u2019s not Chewbacca. It\u2019s not a friendly, well-intentioned creature, it\u2019s a Predator.\u201d",
      "The apt working title of the movie, which will be released Friday by 20th Century Studios, was \u201cBackpack.\u201d",
      "For much of the New Zealand shoot, Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi were every bit as close as they appear to be in the film, where the top half of her artificially intelligent character, Thia, was back-to-back with Schuster-Koloamatangi's young Predator, Dek, who is out to prove himself on a hunt against a seemingly unkillable megamonster.",
      "\u201cHis Predator braids would, like, whip me in the face all the time in our action sequences,\u201d Fanning said with a laugh.",
      "Trachtenberg and the crew used an array of practical ways to make the backpack setup work.",
      "\u201cAny way you can think of making the rig, we tried,\u201d Schuster-Koloamatangi said.",
      "\u201cThrough the mud, through the water, through rivers,\u201d Fanning added.",

      "The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday. It\u2019s as good a reason as any to take a beat and examine how the institution makes it decisions. Who selects the nominees? Who votes? Can anyone nominate any recorded release for a Grammy?",
      "We\u2019ve got you covered. Read on to get a crash course on how Grammy voting works.",
      "Members of the Recording Academy and record labels submit artists in certain categories, which are then vetted for eligibility. Currently, there are 95 Grammy Award categories.",
      "After submissions have been screened, voting members help determine who the final nominations will be \u2014 typically in the fall \u2014 using a membership dashboard. They can only vote for music that has been submitted and vetted.",
      "Once the nominees are determined and announced in November, a period of final round voting takes place. This cycle, that runs from Dec. 12 through Jan. 5.",
      "Winners are announced live at the award show in February.",
      "And don\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 voting members do not vote in all 95 categories. They\u2019re permitted to vote in up to 10 categories across three genre fields, as well as the six general field categories, which include record, album, song, producer, non-classical and songwriter, non-classical of the year, and best new artist. That allows experts to focus on their expertise.",
      "There are three types of Recording Academy memberships: Grammy U, professional and voting memberships. The latter includes performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists and beyond. Those are the members who determine Grammy winners each year.",
      "Voting members have to provide a proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations and certain verifiable credits.",

      "Nov 5, 11:29 AM",
      "But there are a few ways around some of those requirements: If you are a current year\u2019s Grammy winner or nominee, you do not need to provide a recommendation from someone in the industry. If you\u2019ve been nominated for a Grammy in the last five years, you do not need to provide proof of your credits.",
      "Entries must adhere to the specific qualifications of the categories they are submitted into. Rules and guidelines can be found at Grammy.com.",
      "There are also frequent changes made to categories and fields. In 2026, there have been a few: best country album has been divided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories have also been combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.",
      "Most importantly: Recordings and music videos must also be submitted within the Grammy eligibility window, which for the 2026 award show means work released between Aug. 31, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2025.",
      "The category of new artist is constantly evolving, trying to capture the zeitgeist each year as the process of categorizing fame gets more complicated. The Grammy rules currently say nominations hinge on whether \u201cthe artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence\u201d \u2014 and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Eligible artists must have released at least five singles or one album, but there is no longer a maximum. That\u2019s why someone like, say, Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 who broke out in the summer of \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 found herself up for the best new artist trophy in 2025 despite being on her sixth full-length release.",
      "And this year, the category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations announced on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CBS and can be streamed on demand via Paramount+.",

      "He said it is \u201ca remarkable, addictive book. Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights.",

      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden.

      "Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.",
      "\u201cThese are my babies,\u201d said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan\u2019s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.",
      "Kwong is performing something so tricky it's not done in many laboratories: He's growing batches of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most common white blood cells.",
      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",

      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- When summer heat comes to the Arara neighborhood in northern Rio, it lingers, baking the red brick and concrete that make up many of the buildings long after the sun has gone down. Luis Cassiano, who's lived here more than 30 years, says he's getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.",
      "In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning \u2014 Cassiano is one \u2014 can't always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor's, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.",

      "Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions.

      "That's why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.",
      "\u201cI am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,\u201d said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",
      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don\u2019t have savings, that\u2019s really devastating,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.",

      "Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.",
      "Most of the world's 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.",

After Cheney's fifth heart attack in 2010, he acknowledged \u201cincreasing congestive heart failure.\u201d He received another implant, a small pump called a \u201cleft ventricular assist device\u201d or LVAD.

But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage. According to the organ network, 4,572 people received a heart transplant last year. That number of has grown gradually since Cheney's \u2014 there were 2,378 transplants in 2012.

      "In the New York borough of the Bronx, about 200 more people than usual showed up at the World of Life Christian Fellowship International pantry, many bundled in winter hats and coats and pushing collapsible shopping carts as they waited in a line that spanned multiple city blocks. Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.",
      "Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments. She said she usually splits her roughly $200 a month in SNAP benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance.",
      "\u201cIf I didn't have the pantry to come to, I don't know how we would make it,\u201d Martin said.",
      "\u201cI'm not gonna see my grandkids suffer.\u201d",
      "The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food program starting Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. However it was unclear as to when the debit cards that beneficiaries use could be reloaded after the ruling, sparking fear and confusion among many recipients.",
      "In an apparent response to President Donald Trump, who said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts.",
      "McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday.",
      "The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation's social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said \u201cpeople from all walks of life\u201d are seeking help now.",
      "\u201cThe pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,\u201d Udo-Okon said. \u201cYou see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.\u201d",
      "In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The FDA said that the products are no longer recommended for children younger than 3 and those who are older but don't face serious risks of tooth decay. Previously, the products have been prescribed for children as young as six months.",
      "The action stopped short of FDA statements in May suggesting regulators would seek the removal of the products from the market. Instead, the agency sent letters to four companies warning them not to market their products outside the new limits.",
      "Fluoride tablets and lozenges are sometimes recommended for children and teens at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. Companies also sell drops for babies.",
      "The FDA released a new scientific analysis Friday, concluding that fluoride supplements have limited benefits for children's teeth and may be linked to emerging safety concerns, including gut issues, weight gain and cognition.",
      "\u201cFor the same reason fluoride may work to kill bacteria on teeth, it may also alter the gut microbiome, which may have broader health implications,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "The agency also sent a form letter to dentists and other health providers warning about the risks of the products.",
      "Those claims have been disputed by the American Dental Association, which has said there are no significant health problems associated with fluoride when used at the levels prescribed by dentists. The supplements can cause spotting or discoloration of teeth due to the extra fluoride, a downside the FDA also noted.",

Her main rivals, Tundu Lissu of Chadema and Luhaga Mpina of ACT-Wazalendo, were barred from running in what rights groups have called a climate of repression.

      "The designer\u2019s candor about his trauma and recovery further humanized a figure once seen as fashion\u2019s ultimate showman.

      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Indians lit up social media on Wednesday to celebrate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election win as New York City mayor after he thanked his Indian-born parents, quoted a historic speech by India\u2019s first prime minister and turned the victory rally into a Bollywood-style street party.",
      "\u201cWe are proud of him. He has done a great job,\u201d Mamdani\u2019s maternal uncle Vikram Nair told The Associated Press. He said he was flooded with requests from friends and families to throw celebratory parties.",
      "\u201cWe will plan it soon,\u201d he said, adding that the family would love to have Mamdani take part.",
      "The 34-year-old, Ugandan-born Mamdani is set to be New York\u2019s youngest mayor in more than a century \u2014 and the first Muslim one \u2014 when he takes office on Jan. 1.",
      "At a boisterous victory rally late Tuesday, Mamdani addressed supporters with a speech inspired by Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s iconic \u201cTryst with Destiny\u201d address, delivered on the eve of India\u2019s independence in 1947.",
      "\u201cStanding before you, I think of the words of Jawaharlal Nehru: \u2018A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.\u2019 Tonight, we have stepped out from the old into the new,\u201d Mamdani said.",
      "The title track of 2004 Bollywood blockbuster \"Dhoom\u201d played as Mamdani concluded his speech, flanked by his parents and wife Rama Duwaji.",

      "Mamdani\u2019s multi-racial outreach and embrace of his Indian and Muslim identity won him support, but his past remarks about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he publicly called a \u201cwar criminal,\u201d had many expressing concern and anger.",
      "Rights groups have accused Modi\u2019s government of widespread attacks and discrimination against India\u2019s Muslims and other minorities. As chief minister of the state of Gujarat, Modi was accused of not acting to stop communal violence during 2002 anti-Muslim riots that left more than 1,000 people dead.

      "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player and assistant coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he profited from rigged poker games and provided sports bettors with non-public information about injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.",
      "Jones, a onetime teammate of James, said little during back-to-back arraignments in federal court in Brooklyn, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter not guilty pleas in a pair of cases stemming from last month\u2019s federal takedown of sprawling gambling operations.",
      "Jones, 49, acknowledged he read both indictments and that he understood the charges and his bail conditions, which include his mother and stepfather putting up their Texas home as collateral for a $200,000 bond that will allow him to remain free pending trial.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, told a judge that they \u201cmay be engaging in plea negotiations.\u201d He is due back in court for a preliminary conference with other defendants on Nov. 24.",
      "Jones was among more than 30 people arrested in the gambling sweep. The others included reputed mobsters and prominent basketball figures, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier.",
      "Sports bettor Marves Fairley also pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges alleging he cashed in on information about injuries to NBA players, including some that prosecutors say Jones provided to him.",
      "Jones, an NBA journeyman, earned more than $20 million playing for 10 teams in 11 seasons from 1999 to 2009. He and James played together in Cleveland from 2005 to 2008 and he served as an unofficial assistant coach for James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers during the 2022-2023 season.",
      "According to prosecutors, Jones sold or attempted to sell non-public information to bettors that James was injured and wouldn't be playing in a Feb. 9, 2023, game against the Milwaukee Bucks, texting an unnamed co-conspirator: \u201cGet a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out.\u201d",
      "James wasn't listed on the Lakers' injury report at the time of the text message, but the NBA's all-time scoring leader was later ruled out of the game because of a lower body jury, according to prosecutors, and the Lakers lost the game 115-106.",
      "On Jan. 15, 2024, prosecutors said, Fairley paid Jones approximately $2,500 for a tip that Davis, the Lakers' forward and center at the time, would see limited playing time against the Oklahoma City Thunder because of an injury.",
      "Fairley then placed a $100,000 bet on the Thunder to win, prosecutors said, but the tip was wrong. Davis played his usual minutes, scored 27 points and collected 15 rebounds in a 112-105 Lakers win, prompting Fairley to demand a refund of his $2,500 fee, prosecutors said.",

      "After his playing days, he worked as a \u201cshooting consultant\u201d for the Cavaliers and was an assistant coach when the team, led by James, won the NBA championship in 2016.",
      "In the poker scheme, according to prosecutors, Jones was among former NBA players used to lure unwitting players into poker games that were rigged using altered shuffling machines, hidden cameras, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table.",
      "According to the indictment, Jones was paid $2,500 for a game in the Hamptons where he was instructed to cheat by paying close attention to others involved in the scheme. His instructor likened those people to James and NBA All-Star Steph Curry, prosecutors said. When in doubt, Jones was told to fold his hand, prosecutors said.",

      "President Donald Trump has appointed Andrea Lucas as chair of the nation's top workplace civil rights agency",
      "President Donald Trump has named Andrea Lucas as chair of the country's top workplace civil rights agency, the agency announced Thursday. The move signals a vote of confidence for Lucas's efforts to stamp out diversity programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and prioritize religious rights in the workplace.",
      "First nominated to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 during Trump's first administration, Lucas was confirmed in July for a second five-year term. Democratic lawmakers and dozens of civil rights organizations strongly opposed Lucas\u2019 confirmation, accusing her of politicizing the agency against Congress\u2019s intent and undermining workers' civil rights. Republican senators praised her leadership, especially her commitment to rolling back Biden-era guidance on workplace gender identity protections, which Lucas has argued overstepped the EEOC\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m honored to be designated Chair of the EEOC,\u201d Lucas said in an emailed statement Thursday. \u201cUnder the Trump Administration, the Commission has made significant progress advancing its core mission to uphold our nation\u2019s civil rights laws and protect American workers through consistent, effective enforcement. As Chair, I remain committed to enforcing the law evenhandedly, advancing equal opportunity, and upholding merit-based, colorblind equality in America\u2019s workplaces.\u201d",
      "Trump elevated Lucas to acting chair in January and, in an unprecedented move, fired two Democratic commissioners, clearing the way to establish a Republican majority in the agency. The Senate last month confirmed Trump pick Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner, restoring the EEOC to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "In a shake-up of the agency's prior focus, the EEOC under Lucas's leadership has taken on several religious discrimination cases, including a charge against Mayo Clinic alleging it refused to grant a security guard\u2019s request for a religious accommodation to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. The hospital system did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It has also dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny, and stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d a concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out employment practices that disadvantage different demographic groups. Lucas has leveraged the agency to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",

As acting chair, she has made clear she is a Trump loyalist dedicated to carrying out his radical crusade against programs that encourage diversity, equity and inclusion,\" said Lauren Khouri, senior director of workplace equality.",
      "\u201cLucas has a history of abandoning workers at every turn and leaving them without protection, including women workers, transgender and nonbinary workers, and workers of color. People across the country are struggling to make ends meet and find stability at work, and we will fight to ensure they\u2019re able to work safely, free from harassment and discrimination,\" she said.",
      "Conservative legal organization Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, however, expressed optimism for the agency's future. \u201cAndrea Lucas is a champion of equality and race-neutrality,\u201d said WILL vice president and deputy counsel Dan Lennington. \u201cThe EEOC will be pivotal in extinguishing race-conscious policies, like DEI, from the private sector.

      "At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, in fact, lawyer Neal Katyal, representing small businesses suing to get the tariffs struck down, argued that Trump didn\u2019t need the boundless authority he\u2019s claimed to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That is because Congress delegated tariff power to the White House in several other statutes \u2014 though it carefully limited the ways the president could use the authority.",

      "Tariffs have become a cornerstone of Trump's foreign policy in his second term, with double-digit \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America\u2019s longstanding trade deficits a national emergency.",
      "The average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to 17.9%, highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University's Budget Lab.",
      "The president acted alone even though the U.S. Constitution specifically gives the power to tax \u2013 and impose tariffs \u2013 to Congress.",
      "Still, Trump \u201cwill have other tools that can cause pain,\u2019\u2019 said Stratos Pahis of Brooklyn Law School. Here\u2019s a look at some of his options:",
      "The United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in \u201cunjustifiable,\u2019\u2019 \u201cunreasonable\u2019\u2019 or \u201cdiscriminatory\u2019\u2019 trade practices. That is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.",
      "And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself \u2014 especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America\u2019s technological dominance. The U.S. is also using 301 powers to counter what it calls unfair Chinese practices in the shipbuilding industry.",

      "That is partly because Congress had specifically given the White House limited authority to address the problem in another statute: Section 122, also of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days in response to unbalanced trade. The administration doesn\u2019t even have to conduct an investigation beforehand.",
      "But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work.",

      "In 2018, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, levies he\u2019s expanded since returning to the White House. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber.",
      "In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. \u201cEven though people might roll their eyes\u2019\u2019 at the notion that imported furniture poses a threat to national security, Veroneau said, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to get courts to second-guess a determination by a president on a national security matter.\u2019\u2019",
      "Section 232 tariffs are not limited by law but do require an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department. It\u2019s the administration itself that does the investigating \u2013 also true for Section 301 cases \u2014 \u201cso they have a lot of control over the outcome,\u2019\u2019 Veroneau said.",
      "Nearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\u2019\u2019",
      "Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. No investigation is required, and there\u2019s no limit on how long the tariffs can stay in place.",
      "Those tariffs have never been imposed \u2014 U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead \u2014 though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s.",
      "In September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers tariffs.",
      "The Smoot-Hawley legislation has a bad reputation, Veroneau said, but Trump might find it appealing. \u201cTo be the first president to ever use it could have some cache.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration says it plans to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \u201chigh-volume\u201d markets beginning Friday morning to maintain safety during the ongoing government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it was taking the extraordinary step of reducing air traffic by 10% across 40 \u201chigh-volume\u201d markets beginning Friday morning to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The cutback stands to impact thousands of flights nationwide because the FAA directs more than 44,000 flights daily, including commercial passenger flights, cargo planes and private aircraft. The agency didn't immediately identify which airports or cities will be affected but said the restrictions would remain in place as long as necessary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we\u2019ve had a situation where we\u2019re taking these kinds of measures,\u201d FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a news conference.",
      "Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1, and most have been on duty six days a week while putting in mandatory overtime. With some calling out of work due to frustration, taking second jobs or not having money for child care or gas, staffing shortages during some shifts have led to flight delays at a number of U.S. airports.",
      "Bedford, citing increased staffing pressures and voluntary safety reports from pilots indicating growing fatigue among air traffic controllers, said he and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy did not want to wait until the situation reached a crisis point.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait for a safety problem to truly manifest itself when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cThe system is extremely safe today and will be extremely safe tomorrow. If the pressures continue to build even after we take these measures, we\u2019ll come back and take additional measures.\u201d",
      "He and Duffy said they would meet with airline executives later Wednesday to determine how to implement the reduction in flights before a list of the affected airports would be released sometime Thursday.",
      "United, Southwest and American all said they will try to minimize the impact on consumers as they cut their schedules to comply with the order.",
      "Calls to the customer service hotlines at United and American were answered within a few minutes Wednesday afternoon, suggesting anxious passengers were not swamping the airlines with questions about the status of their upcoming flights.",
      "In a letter to employees, United CEO Scott Kirby promised to focus the cuts on regional routes and flights that don't travel between hubs. He said the airline will try to reschedule customers when possible and will also offer refunds to anyone who doesn't want to fly during this time, even if their flight isn't canceled.",
      "\u201cUnited\u2019s long-haul international flying and our hub-to-hub flying will not be impacted by this schedule reduction direction from the FAA,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThat\u2019s important to maintain the integrity of our network, give impacted customers as many options as possible to resume their trip, and sustain our crew pairing systems.\u201d",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, who is president of Atmosphere Research Group, said he thinks the government may have bungled this announcement by not meeting with airlines first and giving them more time to adjust schedules made months in advance.",
      "\u201cTo tell airlines you\u2019ve got 48 hours to rebuild your schedules at 90% of what you\u2019ve got isn\u2019t much time, and it\u2019s going to result in a lot of chaos,\u201d said Harteveldt, who was waiting to hear if his own flight from San Francisco to Dallas on Saturday would be canceled. He added that the Trump administration may be using aviation safety \u201cto force the two sides in Washington back to the negotiating table to resolve the shutdown.\u201d",
      "AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz advised travelers to watch for flight updates on the airline's app and airport social media accounts. She also recommended allowing plenty of time at the airport before a scheduled flight.",

      "The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upward of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium. For example, O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago could see 121 of its 1,212 flights currently scheduled for Friday cut if the FAA distributes the reductions equally among impacted airports, Cirium said.",
      "The FAA regularly slows down or stops flights from taking off toward an airport for a number of reasons, including weather conditions, equipment failures and technical problems. Staffing shortages also may lead to slowed or halted departures if there aren't enough controllers and another facility can't absorb some of the work load.",
      "Last weekend saw some of the worst staffing shortages of the shutdown, which became the longest on record early Wednesday.",
      "From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 different air traffic control facilities announced there was some potential for limited staffing, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans sent through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown",
      "During weekend periods from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional centers overseeing multiple airports and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced the potential for staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the average more than tripled to 26.2 facilities.",

He pointed to all the questions that arose after the deadly midair collision in January between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport about why FAA didn't recognize the risks and act sooner.",
      "\u201cWe learned from that. And so now we look at data, and before it would become an issue, we try to assess the pressure and try to make moves before there could be adverse consequences,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here today.\u201d",

      "In her letter, Kelly emphasized that most company-owned stores as well as 7,000 licensed locations in places like airports will remain open if there is a strike.",

      "Tesla shareholders will decide soon on whether Elon Musk could have a shot at becoming the world's first trillionaire",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk turned off many potential buyers of his Tesla cars and sent sales plunging with his foray into politics. But the stock has soared anyway and now he wants the company to pay him more \u2014 a lot more.",
      "Shareholders gathering Thursday for Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, will decide in a proxy vote whether to grant Musk, the company's CEO and already the richest person in the world, enough stock to potentially make him history's first trillionaire.",
      "It's a vote that has sparked heated debate on both sides of the issue, even drawing the pope's comments on it as an example of income inequality.",
      "Several pension funds have come out against the package, arguing that the board of directors is too beholden to Musk, his behavior too reckless lately and the riches offered too much.",
      "Supporters say Musk is a genius who is the only person capable of ushering in a Tesla-dominated future in which hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars \u2014 many without steering wheels \u2014 will ferry people and humanoid Tesla robots will march around factories and homes, picking up boxes and watering plants. The pay is necessary to incentivize him, they say, and keep him focused.",
      "Musk has threatened to walk away from the company if he doesn't get what he wants and has blasted some of the package\u2019s critics as \u201ccorporate terrorists.\"",
      "To get his Tesla shares, Musk has to secure approval from a majority of the company's voting shareholders. Improving the odds, Musk gets to vote his own shares, worth 15% of the company.",
      "Shareholders first heard about the pay package in September when the board of directors proposed it in a detailed filing to federal securities regulators. The document, running 200 pages, also contains other proposals up for a vote at the meeting, including whether to allow Tesla to invest in another Musk company, xAI, and who should serve on the board in the future.",
      "Musk won't get necessarily get all of that money, or even a cent of it, if the package is approved. He first has to meet several operational and financial targets.",
      "To get the full pay, for instance, he has to deliver to the car market 20 million Teslas over 10 years, more than double the number he has churned out over the past dozen years. He also has to massively increase the market value of the company and its operating profits and deliver one million robots, from zero today.",
      "If he falls short of the biggest goals, though, the package could still hand him plenty of money.",
      "Musk will get $50 billion in additional Tesla shares, for example, if he increases the company's market value by 80%, something he did just this past year, as well as doubling vehicle sales and tripling operating earnings \u2014 or hitting any other two of a dozen operational targets.",
      "Musk is already the richest man in the world with a net worth of $493 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and well ahead of some of the wealthiest of years past.",
      "He's worth more than two Cornelius Vanderbilts, the shipping and railroad magnate of the 19th Century whose inflation-adjusted wealth hit $200 billion or so at its peak. The steel giant, Andrew Carnegie, was once worth $300 billion, according to the Carnegie Corp., well below Musk's wealth, too.",

He says that's a pressing concern given all the power Tesla may soon have, specifically something he referred to in a recent investor meeting as its future \u201crobot army.\u201d",
      "That was a reference to Tesla\u2019s Optimus division, which makes humanoid workers that will be so numerous that, as Musk put it recently, he wouldn\u2019t want anyone else but himself to control them.",

      "Critics include the biggest in the U.S. public pension fund, Calpers, and Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest. They argue the pay is excessive, with the Norway fund expressing concern that the board that designed it, which includes Musk's brother, is not independent enough.

      "Instead, his driverless robotaxis in Austin and San Francisco have human safety monitors inside. Europeans still haven't approved his software. And Tesla sales continue to plunge, with new figures out Monday showing a stunning 50% drop last month in Germany alone.",
      "That said, Musk has pulled off the impossible before. His company a half dozen years ago was widely feared to be near bankruptcy because he wasn't making enough cars, but then he succeeded and the stock soared.",
      "\u201cHe frequently teeters on the edge of disaster,\" said Tesla owner and money manager Nancy Tengler, \"and then pulls back just in the nick of time.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- British retailer Marks and Spencer saw its half-year profits more than halve as a result of a cyberattack that brought its online business to a grinding halt.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, M&S said its underlying pretax profits tumbled 55.4% to 184.1 million pounds ($240 million) in the six months to Sept. 27, largely on the back of a 40% collapse in online home and fashion sales after it was forced to halt website orders.

      "Full-size three-row SUVs can fulfill many needs, with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer",
      "Let\u2019s say you need a vehicle with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer. A full-size three-row SUV should work well, but which one? The most significant news this year is the redesigned Ford Expedition. Ford has given its biggest SUV a complete makeover with a more upscale interior, new technology features and a novel split-opening tailgate.",
      "It\u2019s a compelling pick for a big SUV, but it\u2019s not the only one vying for your attention. The GMC Yukon got its own refresh for 2025. It\u2019s not as comprehensive as the Expedition\u2019s, but it too features a significant interior and technology overhaul that further distances it from its mechanical twin, the Chevy Tahoe. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts tested both to determine which one is the better buy.",
      "The Expedition has a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 in two versions. The standard-output V6 produces 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, while the high-output version pumps out 440 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 19 mpg combined with standard rear-wheel drive and 18 mpg combined with optional four-wheel drive.",
      "The Yukon\u2019s engine choices are an interesting contrast. The standard 5.3-liter V8 produces 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft, while the 6.2-liter V8 standard on top trim levels has a more competitive 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. Fuel economy is up to 17 mpg combined for the 5.3-liter V8; the 6.2-liter gets 16 mpg combined.",
      "At the Edmunds test track, an Expedition with the high-output V6 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. That\u2019s a second quicker than the Yukon with its bigger V8. The Yukon does have an efficiency ace up its sleeve, however. You can get an optional turbodiesel six-cylinder that makes 305 horsepower and 495 lb-ft and gets up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined.",
      "Space and towing",
      "Third-row space is exceptional in both, especially for tall teens or adults. On paper, though, the Expedition has a slight advantage with its 36.5 inches of third-row legroom compared to the Yukon\u2019s 34.9 inches.",
      "Their respective specs also indicate the Yukon has more cargo space. However, in Edmunds\u2019 testing, Ford\u2019s full-size SUV could hold more pieces of luggage behind its third row seat. Specifically, the cargo area is wider back there.",
      "For really big gear hauling, the Expedition can tow a maximum of 9,600 pounds. The Yukon maxes out at 8,400 pounds.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "Both of these SUVs are well-suited for big families. There are subtle differences, however. The Expedition\u2019s greatest strength is undoubtedly space. There\u2019s ample room for passengers in every seat, and the seats are comfortable, especially for the driver and front passenger. We like them better than the Yukon\u2019s front seats for comfort on long drives. We\u2019ve also found that the Expedition has less wind and road noise on the highway than the Yukon.",

The Yukon offers an optional adaptive air suspension that can adjust the SUV\u2019s ride height and automatically soften the shock absorbers to help smooth out the ride even further, but overall we\u2019ve found the Expedition more relaxing and comfortable to drive.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "The GMC Yukon has a distinctive 16.8-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that features a Google-based operating system. The Google integration provides the familiarity of Google Maps and other Google features, such as the voice-based Assistant app. There is an 11-inch digital instrument panel as well with customizable layouts and information. This is a very good tech package that Edmunds rates highly for its functionality and feature content.",
      "That said, we rate the Expedition\u2019s system even higher. It consists of a 13.2-inch touchscreen interface that works in concert with an enormous 24-inch ultra-wide dash-top screen that acts as a combination instrument panel and customizable secondary display for the touchscreen. These screens are bright and easy to read and don\u2019t feel like tech for tech\u2019s sake \u2014 they actually improve functionality.",
      "Both SUVs offer hands-free highway driving assist technology: GMC\u2019s is called Super Cruise and Ford\u2019s is called BlueCruise. Both are effective and reliable, and if either enjoys the slightest advantage, it\u2019s the GMC thanks to its light-up steering wheel that makes it perfectly obvious when the system is operating or needs your attention.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "While the Yukon is luxurious, comfortable and packed with impressive technology features, the Ford Expedition quite simply outdoes it in most respects. It also boasts multiple high-end trim levels that easily hold their own against the top trims of the Yukon for luxury appeal.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James is ready for contact basketball activity, and he will be re-evaluated by the Los Angeles Lakers' team physician in one to two weeks as he prepares to begin his unprecedented 23rd NBA season.",
      "James has yet to play this season or practice with the Lakers after being shut down early in training camp due to sciatica, a lower-body nerve problem. The next step in his recovery is five-on-five basketball work in practice, but it's unclear when that could begin because the Lakers are headed out on a five-game road trip beginning Saturday in Atlanta, and James isn't expected to travel with the team.",
      "The 40-year-old James has been working out individually in recent weeks. The Lakers announced James' progression to contact basketball on Thursday, exactly four weeks after the team initially said the top scorer in NBA history would be re-evaluated in three to four weeks.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a target date,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said last week of James' progress. \"It\u2019s just somewhere in that general timeline. We hope that he\u2019s kind of checked all the boxes and is going to be back sometime in that second or third week in November.\u201d",
      "If James wants on-court work while the Lakers are on the road, he could conceivably join the Lakers' G League affiliate at the team's training complex in El Segundo. The Lakers' next home game is Nov. 18.",
      "The Lakers have played remarkably well in James' absence, stoking fans' excitement about being a possible contender six seasons after James and Anthony Davis won the franchise's 17th championship in the Florida bubble.",

    "story": [
      "Mel Greenberg started the women's basketball poll 50 years ago at the Philadelphia Inquirer",
      "When Mel Greenberg's boss approached him a half century ago about starting the women's basketball poll, he balked.",
      "The Philadelphia Inquirer sports writer didn't think he'd be able to pull together the information needed to deliver a legitimate poll. Women's games were almost never aired on national television in 1976 and the internet wouldn't come along for another few decades, making scores and other statistics challenging to gather.",
      "But as generations of sports fans now know, Greenberg found a way. The season of women's college basketball that began this week marks the 50th anniversary of a poll that has helped shape the sport and draw lasting attention to women's athletics.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how far down the line we are and what it is,\u201d the now 78-year-old Greenberg said in a phone interview.",
      "Back in 1976, Greenberg knew that for the poll to work, he'd need the blessing of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, which ran women's college sports before the NCAA took over in 1982. That didn't come right away.",
      "After he first reached out to them, they sent him a position paper that included a line that said: \"Women should not get involved in newspaper games and things like polls because it will lead to the evils of men\u2019s athletics.\u2019\u201d",
      "Months later Greenberg circled back to them after talking to a bunch of coaches. The organization said they \u201cwere encouraged by what you're doing.\u201d",
      "That's all he needed to get the poll off the ground. He set up a network of coaches across the country who would call in their votes every Sunday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Mel wanting to bring some excitement and attention to the game,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cI still remember being asked to be on the voting pool of coaches that would get a phone call from Mel. It meant a lot. We were all fighting for a little bit of recognition and we weren\u2019t getting much of it from many sources. God bless Mel as he was one of the few who wanted to give it to you.\u201d",
      "The coaches expected the long late night calls from Greenberg, who is affectionally know as the \u201cGuru\u201daround the sport.",
      "\u201cThe only way to find out what was going on in the country was talk to Mel on Sunday night,\u201d Greenberg recalled Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt telling him years ago.",
      "The first poll was published in the Philadelphia Inquirer in November 1976 and two years later The Associated Press started distributing it around the country.",

      "Greenberg was still active in the poll, voting until he retired from the Inquirer in 2010. Fifteen years later he still updates his vast poll database every Monday when the new Top 25 comes out.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started doing it I wasn't keeping the data. It got done and then off to the next one,\" he recalled. \u201c(N.C. State coach) Kay Yow called me a few weeks in and hit me over the head with a virtual plywood board and said you got to keep the records, you're going to be our history.\u201d",
      "And that he is, recalling stories from his 50 years covering the sport.",
      "Greenberg still goes to games, having been to thousands of them over his career, sometimes taking in three or four in a single day. He has been to every NCAA Final Four since the first one in 1982.",
      "\u201cMel was at the very foundation of women\u2019s basketball, promoting it as a sport before anyone else in the media gave it much thought,\u201d said South Carolina coach Dawn Staley. \"His work first in Philly and then nationally was integral to how media outlets came to understand the quality and value of women\u2019s basketball. All these years later, it\u2019s impressive to see him still singing the praises of the sport he poured his heart and soul into.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "As the saying went, all roads once led to Rome \u2014 and scientists now say those roads stretched 50% longer than previously known",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the saying went, all roads once led to Rome \u2014 and those roads stretched 50% longer than previously known, according to a new digital atlas published Thursday.",
      "The last major atlas of ancient Roman road networks was published 25 years ago. Since then, advances in technology and other newly accessible sources have greatly expanded researchers\u2019 ability to locate ancient roadways.",
      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data. Scientists then looked for clues in satellite imagery and aerial photography, including recently digitized photos taken from planes during World War II.",
      "When ancient accounts hinted at lost roads in a certain area, researchers analyzed the terrain from above to spot subtle traces \u2014 things like faint differences in vegetation, soil variations or shifts in elevation, as well as traces of ancient engineering like raised mounds or cut hillsides \u2014 that revealed where Roman lanes once ran.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a massive game of connecting the dots on a continental scale,\u201d said Tom Brughmans, an archaeologist and co-author of the study published in Scientific Data.",
      "The data and an interactive digital map are also available online for scholars, history teachers or anyone with an interest in ancient Roman history.",
      "Earlier research had focused on \u201cthe highways of the Roman Empire\u201d \u2014 the large thoroughfares most often mentioned in familiar historical accounts, said Brughmans.",
      "The updated map fills in more obscure details about \u201csecondary roads, like the country lanes, that connected villas and farms\u201d and other locations, said Brughmans, who's based at Aarhus University in Denmark.",
      "Researchers previously tallied the extent of Roman roads as covering around 117,163 miles (188,555 kilometers). The new work shows nearly 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) of roads across the extent of the Roman Empire, allowing travel from Spain to Syria.",
      "The study added a lot to archaeologists' knowledge of ancient roads in North Africa, the plains of France and in the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece.",
      "\u201cThis will be a very foundational work for a lot of other research,\u201d said archaeologist Benjamin Ducke of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin, who was not involved in the project.",

      "Being able to visualize the ancient routes that Roman farmers, soldiers, diplomats and other travelers took will provide a better understanding of key historical trends that depended on the movement of people during Roman times, said Brughmans, including the rise of Christianity across the region and the spread of ancient outbreaks.",
      "\u201cThe Romans left a huge impact with this road network,\u201d which created the blueprint for many roads still in use today, said study co-author and archaeologist Adam Pa\u017eout of the Autonomous University of Barcelona.",

But during that time, they also funded underprivileged schools, immigration reform and efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, the billionaire couple is shifting the bulk of their philanthropic resources to Biohub, the pair's science organization, and focusing on using artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery. The idea is to develop virtual, AI-based cell models to understand how they work in the human body, study inflammation and use AI to \u201charness the immune system\u201d for disease detection, prevention and treatment.",
      "\u201cI feel like the science work that we\u2019ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done. So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,\u201d Zuckerberg said Wednesday evening at an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City, California. Three other Biohub institutes \u2014 in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, focus on addressing different scientific challenges.",
      "Chan and Zuckerberg have pledged 99% of their lifetime wealth \u2014 from shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO \u2014 toward these efforts. Since 2016, when Biohub launched, they have donated $4 billion to basic science research, a figure that does not include operating expenses for running a large-scale computer cluster for life science research. The organization says it is now on track to double that amount over the next decade, with an operating budget of about $1 billion a year.",
      "Last week, singer Billie Eilish told an audience that included Chan and Zuckerberg that rich people should do more to address the world\u2019s problems.",
      "\u201cLove you all, but there\u2019s a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\u201d she said, to a smattering of applause. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\u201d",
      "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s charitable organization, has been faced with criticism recently for curtailing its other philanthropic work. Earlier this year, it stopped funding grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion, immigration advocacy and other issues currently in the crosshairs of the Trump administration \u2014 though the focus has been shifting to science and away from social issues for years, the couple says, long before the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cSo we basically looked at the ecosystem of science funding and decided that the place that we can make the biggest impact was on tool development,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd specifically working on long-term projects, 10 to 15 years, where the output of them was taking on a biological challenge that would produce a tool that scientists everywhere could use to accelerate the pace of science.\u201d",
      "The organization earlier this year scrubbed its website's mentions of DEI, including a statement saying \u201cPeople of color and marginalized communities have experienced a long history of exploitation in the name of scientific research, and indeed science has itself been deployed as a tool of oppression.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing forward, Biohub will be our primary philanthropic effort and where we\u2019ll dedicate the vast majority of our resources,\u201d Zuckerberg and Chan said in a blog post Thursday. \u201cWe will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives.\u201d",

Similar to how large language models learn from vast databases of digital books, online writings and other media, its researchers and scientists are working toward building virtual systems that serve as digital representations of human physiology on all levels, such as molecular, cellular or genome. As it is open source \u2014 free and publicly available \u2014 scientists can then conduct virtual experiments on a scale not possible in physical laboratories.",

We have cured diseases for mice and for flies and for zebrafish, many, many times. And that\u2019s great. But we want to make sure that we are actually using biology to push the forefront of medicine for people \u2014 and that is so promising.\u201d",

      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",

      "\u201cIt overwhelmed me so much,\u201d Watson recalled. \u201cI just started bursting out in tears, because suddenly, I was there naked.\u201d",
      "In the four years since her experience, deepfakes \u2014 highly realistic artificial intelligence-generated images, videos or audio of real people or events \u2014 have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic. That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission. A bill that's expected to pass early next year would change copyright law by imposing a ban on the sharing of deepfakes to protect citizens\u2019 personal characteristics \u2014 such as their appearance or voice \u2014 from being imitated and shared online without their consent.",
      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",

Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.",
      "Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said that the bill has broad support from lawmakers in Copenhagen, because such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and spread misinformation.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to deepfake a politician without her or him being able to have that product taken down, that will undermine our democracy,\u201d he told reporters during an AI and copyright conference in September.",
      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",

      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a black hole",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\u201cAt first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\u201d said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7 trillion kilometers).",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. But scientists still aren\u2019t sure how they form.",

      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for tripling government spending artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech to the legislature",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday called for tripling the government spending on projects for expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech.",
      "Lee also called for lawmakers to approve a planned 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the military\u2019s weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States, as the allies\u2019 military chiefs met in Seoul for annual security talks.",
      "Most conservative opposition lawmakers boycotted Lee\u2019s speech amid an ongoing rift over a criminal investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came after South Korea last week hosted the leaders of major Pacific Rim nations for this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which his government used to showcase its ambitions for AI and advance an effort at a trade deal with the U.S.",
      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",
      "Lee said the proposed budget of 728 trillion won ($506 billion), which would represent an all-time high for government spending, would be the country\u2019s \u201cfirst budget to open the AI era.\u201d",
      "He called on the liberal-led legislature to approve 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion) in AI-related spending \u2014 more than triple this year\u2019s level \u2014 to advance the country\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities, with a particular focus on industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding and robotics.",
      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",
      "Lee said South Korean companies would have little difficulty securing the chips for their AI projects, citing a deal for Nvidia, whose GPUs power much of the global AI industry, to supply 260,000 graphics processing units for AI infrastructure projects with major South Korean businesses and the government. The deal was announced following a meeting during APEC between Lee and Jensen Huang, the Silicon Valley company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when Nvidia \u2014 which agreed to deliver 50,000 GPUs each to the government, chipmakers Samsung and SK, and automaker Hyundai, and another 60,000 to internet company Naver \u2014 will deliver those chips. Huang told reporters in South Korea that AI data centers and power networks must first be established before the company can begin shipping the GPUs.",

      "Lee proposed a defense budget of 66.3 trillion won ($46 billion) next year, which he said will be focused on modernizing the military\u2019s weapons systems, including through the adoption of AI technologies, to make the armed forces more self-reliant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national pride that South Korea, which spends 1.4 times North Korea\u2019s annual GDP on defense and is perceived as the world\u2019s fifth most powerful military, continues to depend on others for its security,\u201d Lee said.",

      "Lee\u2019s speech came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back were meeting in Seoul for the allies\u2019 annual security talks.

    "story": [
      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

      "Flight delays continued at U.S. airports Sunday amid air traffic controller shortages as the government shutdown entered its second month, with Newark airport in New Jersey experiencing delays of two to three hours.",
      "New York City's Emergency Management office said on X that Newark delays often ripple out to the region's other airports.",
      "Travelers flying to, from or through New York \u201cshould expect schedule changes, gate holds, and missed connections. Anyone flying today should check flight status before heading to the airport and expect longer waits,\u201d the social media post added.",
      "George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago O'Hare were also seeing dozens of delays and one or two cancellations, along with major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver and Miami, according to FlightAware.",
      "As of Sunday evening, FlightAware said there were 4,295 delays and 557 cancelations of flights within, into or out of the U.S., not all related to controller shortages. In July, before the shutdown, about 69% of flights were on time and 2.5% were canceled.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been warning that travelers will start to see more flight disruptions the longer controllers go without a paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you\u2019ll see delays, we\u2019ll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe,\u201d Duffy said Sunday on CBS'S \u201cFace the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\u201d",

      "Earlier in October, Duffy had warned air traffic controllers who had called in sick instead of working without a paycheck during the shutdown risked being fired. Even a small number of controllers not showing up for work is causing problems because the FAA has a critical shortage of them.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday on X that nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers have been working without pay for weeks.",
      "Staffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don\u2019t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major U.S. airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.",
      "Before the shutdown, the FAA was already dealing with a long-standing shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",

      "Udio, an AI song generation platform, has announced a 48-hour window starting Monday for users to download their songs",
      "Artificial intelligence song generation platform Udio said it would give its frustrated users 48 hours starting Monday to download their songs before the company shifts to a new business model to comply with a legal settlement.",
      "The short reprieve comes after Udio on Wednesday said it had settled copyright infringement claims brought by Universal Music, a label with artists including Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "AI companies are now fighting so many copyright lawsuits that a tech industry lobby group, the Chamber of Progress, last week called on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order directing federal attorneys \u201cto intervene in legal cases\u201d to defend the industry's practice of building generative AI tools by feeding them on copyrighted works.",
      "Citing more than 50 pending federal cases, the group asked for help stopping court fights leading to \u201cpotentially company-killing penalties\u201d that threaten AI innovation. But artists have warned that AI tools built on their works also threaten their livelihoods.",
      "In the biggest settlement so far, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion \u2014 or $3,000 per book \u2014 to settle claims from authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "Udio and Universal didn't disclose the financial terms of their new music licensing agreements. They also said they will team up on a new streaming platform.",
      "As part of the agreement, Udio immediately stopped allowing people to download songs they\u2019ve created, which sparked a backlash and apparent exodus among paying users.",
      "\u201cWe know the pain it causes to you,\u201d Udio later said in a post on Reddit's Udio forum, where users were venting about feeling betrayed by the platform\u2019s surprise move and complained that it limited what they could do with their music.",
      "Udio said it still must stop downloads as it transitions to a new streaming platform next year. But over the weekend, it said it will give people 48 hours starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday to keep their \u201cpast creations.\u201d",

      "The settlement deal was the music industry's first since Universal, along with Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records, sued Udio and another AI song generator, Suno, last year over copyright infringement.",
      "Udio and Suno pioneered AI song generation technology, which can spit out new songs based on prompts typed into a chatbot-style text box. Users, who don\u2019t need musical talent, can merely request a tune in the style of, for example, classic rock, 1980s synth-pop or West Coast rap.",
      "Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them.",
      "In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way,\u201d The Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\" ABBA's \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and holiday favorites like \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d and \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d",

      "\u201cLicensing is the only version of AI\u2019s future that doesn\u2019t result in the mass destruction of art and culture,\" the group said. \u201cBut this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The judge told the administration to fully fund SNAP for the month of November.",
      "A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to make a payment to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the month of November by Friday.",
      "\"People have gone without for too long, not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable,\" said U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr.",
      "Judge McConnell directly rebuked President Donald Trump for stating \"his intent to defy\" a court order by saying earlier this week that SNAP will not be funded until the government reopens from the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "\"In fact, the day before the compliance was ordered, the president stated his intent to defy the court order when he said, 'SNAP payments will be given only when the government opens,'\" the judge said.",
      "McConnell last Friday ordered the government to use emergency funds\u00a0to pay for SNAP in time for the Nov. 1 payments to be made -- but the administration committed to only partially funding the program, saying they had to save the additional funds for child nutrition programs.",
      "DOJ lawyers, in a court filing late Thursday, said they intend to appeal Thursday's order, as well as McConnell's order from last week requiring SNAP be funded.",
      "Vice President JD Vance responded to the ruling on Thursday, saying, \"It's an absurd ruling, because you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown.\"",
      "\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\u201d Vance added, placing blame on the Democrats for the shutdown.",
      "McConnell, in Thursday's order, criticized the Trump administration for only making a partial payment when it had additional emergency funds and knew the payments would not be delivered in time to comply with his court order.",
      "\"Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,\" said Judge McConnell. \"Children are immediately at risk of going hungry. This should never happen in America.\"",
      "After the Trump administration earlier this week committed to paying out 65% of the typical SNAP amount by tapping into emergency funds, a group of nonprofits and local governments argued that partially funding SNAP was insufficient to comply with the McConnell's order.",
      "\"Given Congress's failure to appropriate sufficient funds for November SNAP benefits and USDA's adherence to both the statute and its own regulations regarding partial benefits, it cannot be arbitrary and capricious for USDA to decline to raid an entirely different program, to the tune of billions of dollars, in the mere hope that Congress will fix the ensuing deficit through the general appropriations process,\" DOJ lawyers responded in a court filing Wednesday.",
      "McConnell originally gave the Trump administration a choice between making a full payment by Monday or a partial payment by Wednesday, saying the government was required to \"expeditiously eliminate\" any potential delays to make sure SNAP benefits would continue. Because they failed to do so -- acknowledging in their own court papers that the payments could take weeks or months -- the Trump administration did not comply with the court's temporary restraining order, the judge ruled.",
      "\"It is clear to the court that the administration did not comply\u00a0with this Court's oral order of 10/31/25, or its written order of November 1, 2025,\" McConnell said in Thurday's order. \"The court was clear that the administration had to either make the full payment by this past Monday, or it must 'expeditiously resolve the administrative and clerical burdens' it described in its papers, but under no circumstances shall the partial payments be made later than Wednesday, November 5, 2025.\u00a0The record is clear that the administration did neither.\"",
      "\"The government had an obligation in following the order to make the full payment so that people everywhere throughout the country would get their SNAP benefits immediately,\" the judge said. \"We've now gone six days without needed food to the 42 million, 16 million children. Irreparable harm.\u00a0That's what the court's temporary restraining order attempted to resolve.\"",

      "\"Your Honor, the government complied with the court's order,\" said DOJ lawyer Tyler Becker. \"We stated on Monday night, when we filed with the court, that ... we resolved all of the\u00a0burdens that the government is responsible for under the regulations and under the statute.\"",
      "Kristin Bateman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, argued that the Trump administration was deliberately flouting the court's order to gain political leverage. While the Trump administration argued it was reserving additional emergency funds for child nutrition programs, she called the claim \"facially implausible\" because the government has enough money to pay for child nutrition programs through June.",
      "\"[They] have not explained why they would choose to let 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, go hungry now, in order to guard against the extreme outside chance that come June, there won't be enough money to fund child nutrition programs,\" she said. \"What defendants are really trying to do is to leverage people's hunger to gain partisan political advantage in the shutdown fight,\" she said.",
      "McConnell appeared to agree, rebuking administration officials and Trump himself for \"withholding SNAP benefits for political reasons.\"",
      "He said statements by Trump and other top officials \"who admit to withholding full SNAP benefits for political reasons\" directly undermine the argument that the government was saving emergency funds to pay for child nutrition programs.",
      "McConnell said the government's argument that it did not want to tap into emergency funds in order to protect child nutrition programs was implausible, and accused the Trump administration of \" erroneously and intentionally\" conflating the funding. He highlighted that the child nutrition programs are currently funded through at least May, while SNAP has already run out of money.",
      "\"Contrary to the defendant's argument, 29 million children are not at risk of going hungry,\" he said. \"Transferring approximately $4 billion to fully fund November SNAP benefits would still leave $19.35 billion in Section 32 funds, enough to fully fund child nutrition programs through May and beyond.\"",
      "The judge McConnell faulted the Trump administration for doing \"nothing\" to alleviate the delays associated with a partial payment.",
      "\"USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments,\" he said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates SNAP. \"USDA arbitrarily and capriciously created this problem by ignoring the congressional mandate for contingency funds and failing to timely notify the states.\"",
      "The judge said the Trump administration was causing \"irreparable harm\" by not ensuring that millions of Americans get critical assistance.",
      "\"To be clear, irreparable harm means harm to families, elderly, children and others that cannot be undone. The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur,\" he said.",
      "Judge McConnell became one of the first federal district court judges in Trump's second term to block a Trump executive action when earlier this year he issued an injunction against an Office of Management and Budget memo ordering an across-the-board freeze on all government spending. The memo was later rescinded by the administration.",
      "McConnell, in rare public remarks for a federal judge, said recently that he has had six credible death threats directed at him in the wake of that episode.",

      "Democrat Mikie Sherrill is projected to win the New Jersey gubernatorial election against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.",
      "As of 9:30 p.m. with 63% of the expected vote reporting, Sherrill holds more than a 14-point lead -- 57.0% to 42.4%.",
      "\u201cNew Jersey, it is the honor of my life to earn your trust to become this great state\u2019s 57th Governor,\u201d Sherrill\u00a0wrote on X, celebrating her victory. \u201cI promise to listen, lead with courage, and never forget who I serve.\u201d",
      "The former Navy pilot makes history as the first\u00a0Democratic\u00a0female governor of New Jersey. Former Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was the state's first female governor, serving two terms from 1994 to 2001.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s victory breaks a notable trend in the state, as no party has controlled the NJ governor\u2019s seat for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. Her Democratic governorship will immediately succeed current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s back-to-back terms.",
      "Sherrill represents New Jersey\u2019s 11th congressional district, which includes parts of Essex and Morris County. She flipped the district when she won in 2018.",
      "Tuesday's results mark Ciattarelli\u2019s third unsuccessful bid for governor. The former state assemblyman set his sights on the governor\u2019s mansion in 2017, but failed to secure the Republican primary. He made it to the general election in 2021, but lost to Gov. Phil Murphy by just 3 points.",
      "Sherrill consistently led Ciattarelli in the polls throughout the course of the campaign, though their distance narrowed slightly in the days leading up to the election.",
      "Ciattarelli\u2019s loss comes as Republicans have tightened their margins in New Jersey in recent years, with Trump losing the state by just 6 points in 2024, compared to 16 points in 2020.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton has already reacted to the news, congratulating Sherrill on her victory.",
      "\u201cToday is a great day for New Jersey as the people have chosen an experienced, get-the-job-done kind of leader who will fight for you every day as Governor.\u00a0Congratulations\u00a0on your election,\u201d he wrote\u00a0on X.",

      "Sherrill and Ciattarelli have clashed over affordability, taxes and policy, while also pointing to the national context of the second Trump administration. During one of their debates, Ciattarelli embraced the main tenets of Trump\u2019s presidency while attempting to keep some distance between himself and Trump's greater political movement; meanwhile, Sherrill took several opportunities to criticize Trump while looking to tie the president and Ciattarelli tightly together.",
      "The race was jolted in September after the National Archives blamed a technician's mistake for the release of Sherrill's unredacted military records that included personal information, which she alleged was intentional. Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has slammed her admission that she did not walk at Naval Academy graduation because she did not tell on cheating classmates.",

      "Zohran Mamdani is set to become the city's first Muslim mayor.",
      "After New York City chose Zohran Mamdani to become the city's 111th mayor, exit polls revealed that the mayor-elect captured the majority of votes from both the younger population and newcomers to the city.",
      "Some experts said Mamdani's success with these voters resulted from his campaign's messaging about challenging the status quo.",
      "\"He awakened something in them. That goes for the new voters and young voters, where they thought that they had to accept the status quo of politics as usual and things that are coming out of Washington, D.C., and the corruption that we've had, and they realize that they actually don't have to look that way,\" Christina Greer, an associate political science professor at Fordham University, told ABC News.",
      "Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, captured 78% of voters under 30 and 66% of those voters 30 to 44 in Tuesday's election, according to ABC News exit polls, conducted by SSRS. Among voters 45 to 64, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo edged out Mamdani, 53% to 47%. A majority of voters 65 and older (55%) voted for Cuomo while 36% voted for Mamdani. Additionally, newcomers to the city were some of the most likely voters in the state to vote for Mamdani, with 81% of those who have lived in New York City less than 10 years supporting him, the exit polls found.",
      "Along with his electoral success among younger and newer New Yorkers, Mamdani also earned support from 55% of voters who lived in the city for over 10 years, but were not born in the city. More of those who were born in New York City voted for Cuomo (49%) than Mamdani (38%), according to the exit polls.",
      "More first-time New York City mayoral voters also voted for Mamdani than those who have previously voted for mayor in the city, 66% versus 47%, the exit polls found.",
      "Greer said this accomplishment in gathering the majority of the youth's vote was through Mamdani's engagement in social media, along with the campaign's clear message about working as a community.",
      "\"This campaign, which was incredibly run, was clear and consistent that it's not just about beating someone else -- meaning the Republican Party or Donald Trump or Andrew Cuomo -- it was about an additive type of politics, where if we work together, we can collectively get more. I think that message resonated with a lot of people,\" Greer said.",
      "Additionally, Mamdani's focus on the affordability of New Yorkers -- specifically his plans to freeze rent for rent-stabilized apartments and provide universal child care and free buses -- \"resonated\" with younger generations, according to Jessica Siles, the senior director of communications for advocacy organization Voters of Tomorrow.",
      "\"I think New York has some specific affordability issues that maybe aren't everywhere in the country. When you are moving to New York, there are certain financial hurdles in some ways that make things difficult. So fresh faces absolutely are looking for some relief and leadership that is able to at least have them feel like they're better equipped to navigate them,\" Siles told ABC News.",
      "Asked to comment on Mamdani securing the votes of younger people and newcomers to the city, a spokesperson for Cuomo's campaign said, \"it's more than that.\"",
      "\"This needs to be a city for everyone and the fact that nearly half of New Yorkers from across the spectrum united against what the democratic nominee in an overwhelmingly democratic city campaigned on shouldn't be overlooked,\" Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement to ABC News. \"We're proud of the campaign Andrew Cuomo ran in the general, a record 42% on an independent ballot line buried on the ballot.\"",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a trusted politician in some ways because he had a 40-year head start over Mamdani. His father was a governor in the 90s. Older New Yorkers and New Yorkers who have been in the city for several decades or generations know that Cuomo is a known Democratic quantity,\" Greer said.",
      "Despite Cuomo's favorability with native New Yorkers, Mamdani's ability to meet with voters across the city -- whether they are waiting in a taxi cab line or on the subway -- allowed for everyone in the city, including those who are new to the area, to quickly become familiar with his vision, Greer said.",
      "\"Whether it's a church or a club, he was there. He's on the subway. If you say you want to be mayor of New York, he's actually in lots of different places where people are,\" Greer said. \"It's reminiscent of Obama days -- at a certain point in time, it's not about the candidate, it's about the movement.\"",
      "Regardless of where Mamdani was engaging with New Yorkers, Siles said he was better able to build a community and \"coalition of support of all ages,\" creating avenues for people -- including fresh faces in the city -- to connect.",
      "\"I think that a lot of young people who perhaps have moved here fairly recently were able to really meaningfully connect with their neighbors and their peers and their community in a way that maybe hasn't been provided to them before, in a really meaningful way that is striving to improve the city,\" Siles added.",
      "While Greer said Mamdani must follow through on the promises he has made during his campaign to maintain the support of all demographics, his voters might give him grace due to his ambition as a leader.",
      "\u201cIf New Yorkers see that he is working for them, they are more likely to give him some sort of grace as he tries to deliver on behalf of the people. They want to see people fighting for them. Some of that will be just the sheer ambition of not just the agenda, but the aggression of the new mayor in trying to deliver on behalf of millions of New Yorkers,\" Greer told ABC News.",

      "Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani all campaigned with affordability as the main focus.",
      "Although each candidate has different proposals to lower costs -- with Mamdani being the most vocal with raising the tax rate on the wealthiest to pay for services such as child care -- voters in huge numbers were attracted to their messages.",
      "Voters are not happy with the state of the country",
      "Just as with last year's elections, where nearly every Democratic led state shifted red, voters appeared to want change from the status quo.",
      "A large majority of voters who said they were angry supported Sherrill, saying they were unhappy with how things were going on in the country. New Jersey has never elected a governor from the same party in three cycles in a row.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey defeated democratic socialist Omar Fateh and 13 other challengers Wednesday during the final round of counting in the city's ranked-choice voting election.",
      "Frey, who secured a third term, led Fateh by about 10 percentage points after Tuesday night's first round of counting but didn't cross the 50%-plus-one-vote threshold he needed to win outright.",
      "According to final but unofficial results posted by the city, Frey got 50.03% of the vote in the second and final round to 44.37% for Fateh. Frey's finish was an improvement from his 49.1% in 2021.",
      "The way ranked-choice voting works in Minneapolis, if no candidate clears the threshold in the first round, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated for the next round of counting, while second- and third-choice rankings are allocated to the surviving candidates.",
      "Frey, a mainstream Democrat, and Fateh, a Democratic state senator who is a democratic socialist, led a 15-candidate field. The only other candidates drawing significant votes were the Rev. DeWayne Davis and businessman Jazz Hampton, who were further back.",
      "\u201cFrom right now through my final seconds as mayor, I will work tirelessly to make our great city a place where everyone, regardless of who you are or where you come from, can build a brilliant life in an affordable home and a safe neighborhood,\" Frey said in a statement. He planned to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to further comment.",
      "Fateh congratulated Frey on his win.",
      "\u201cThey may have won this race, but we have changed the narrative about what kind of city Minneapolis can be,\" Fateh said in a statement. \u201cBecause now, truly affordable housing, workers\u2019 rights, and public safety rooted in care are no longer side conversations; they are at the center of the narrative.\u201d",

      "But Shay said more Americans are growing selective and they're focused on discounts. And while spending is expected to be up again, the growth of that spending may be in decline.",
      "That is still greater than the average increase of 3.6% between 2010 to 2019. Americans ramped up spending after that during the coronavirus pandemic. Holiday season sales rose 8.9% in 2020 and soared 12.5% in 2021, according to the NRF.",
      "The group's holiday forecast is based on economic modeling using various key economic indicators including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment, wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales releases. NRF\u2019s calculation excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail.",
      "Holiday spending accounts for 19% of annual sales for the retail industry, though for some retailers the number is a lot higher, according to the NRF. And consumer spending in the U.S. is monitored closely because it drives about 70% of the nation's gross domestic product.",
      "The forecast this year, however, arrives during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. There has been no government data released on the jobs market or retail sales since the shutdown began 37 days ago.",

      "Based on spending from its credit card and bank customers, Bank of America found that spending growth among lower income households rose 0.6% in September compared with the same period last year. Among higher income brackets, spending rose at more than four times that speed, or 2.6%, in September. And wages are growing faster for higher income households.",
      "That is making it more difficult for lower income households to keep up when tariffs and other economic factors are pushing prices higher.",

That order expired in September, but the roughly 2,000 National Guard troops from D.C. and at at least eight states remain in the city, with most contingents saying they plan to withdraw by the end of November.",
      "The D.C. National Guard is the single largest contributor of troops with 949 soldiers that make up the task force that totals 2,375 troops. West Virginia is the next largest state to contribute troops to the task force with 416 guardsmen.",
      "Some have been armed and providing a military presence in public spaces, especially in the federal parks around the city and at subway stations as well as the Amtrak train station.",
      "The National Guard task force appears to have spent a large portion of its time on yardwork and landscaping efforts around the nation\u2019s capital. In an update provided in early October, task force officials boasted that troops cleared 1,150 bags of trash, spread 1,045 cubic yards of mulch, removed 50 truckloads of plant waste, cleared 7.9 miles of roadway, painted 270 feet of fencing and pruned 400 trees. Since then, most daily updates from the task force only offered new troop figures and no summaries of beautification efforts.",

Attorney General Brian Schwalb challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the National Guard in the heavily Democratic city. That lawsuit sparked filings by 45 states with 23 supporting the Trump administration and 22 aligning with Washington. The Trump administration has argued that he has full authority to deploy guard troops in Washington because he is the designated commander of the D.C. Guard.",
      "In court papers filed by Schwalb seeking to have the guard removed from the city, the documents indicated that there were plans for the D.C. Guard to potentially remain in the city at least through next summer. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, heard arguments Oct. 24 on Schwalb's request but reached no decision.",
      "It's unclear how long the other states, which currently include Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama, will keep their troops deployed to the task force in Washington. Several of the states told the AP they planned to end their deployments by Nov. 30 but indicated that also depended on whether orders were issued extending their deployments. The order does not mention the other states.",

      "North Florida\u2019s Apalachicola Bay will soon reopen for wild oyster harvesting",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- North Florida's Apalachicola Bay will reopen for wild oyster harvesting, a move that supporters hope will breathe life into one of the last historic working waterfronts in a state where much of the picturesque coastline has long given way to high-rise condos and strip mall souvenir shops.",
      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission approved the plan Wednesday to reopen the bay for a limited oyster season on Jan. 1, 2026, five years after the waters that had been nationally known for the sweet, plump shellfish were closed because of dwindling populations.",
      "The closure of the bay along what is known as Florida\u2019s \u201cForgotten Coast\u201d dealt a blow to an area that historically produced 90% of the state\u2019s oysters and 10% of the nation\u2019s supply.",
      "Apalachicola oysters were iconic, comparable to Maine lobster and Maryland blue crabs, and their loss marked another sign that a way of life for generations of commercial fishermen is disappearing along with their harvest.",
      "The once-booming oyster industry is part of the lifeblood of the town of Apalachicola, which in the 1800s became the third-largest port on the Gulf of Mexico, trailing only New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "Many oystermen haven't adjusted well to being forced off the water and into \u201cland jobs\" like construction and landscaping, said Wayne Williams, president of the area\u2019s Seafood Work & Watermen\u2019s Association.",

      "Over the years, waves of drought and the water demands of metro Atlanta and farmers upstream have sapped the Apalachicola River and the bay it flows into \u2014 sparking a protracted legal fight known as the \u201cwater wars\u201d that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately sided with Georgia.",
      "The decreased freshwater flows, as well as predation, overharvesting, habitat loss and hurricanes, ultimately pushed Apalachicola oyster production into free-fall, spurred the federal government to declare a fishery disaster in 2013, and triggered the full closure of the bay in 2020.",
      "Now, state regulators say populations have recovered enough to allow a limited reopening of a small portion of the bay for commercial and recreational harvesting, with rules set for the number and size of oysters that can be taken and from which reefs. The initial season will run from Jan. 1 through Feb. 28, with the following seasons running each Oct. 1 through Feb. 28.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi Democrats appear to have broken a Republican supermajority in the state Senate, claiming victories in two Republican-held districts that were redrawn after a court ruled they should have greater representation for Black voters.",
      "Unofficial county election results show Democrats leading, but vote totals may change as absentee ballots can still be received up to five days after the election. Local election officials have until Nov. 14 to verify county results and pass their totals on to the Mississippi Secretary of State for certification.",
      "The Democratic gains in Mississippi were part of strong performance Tuesday in statehouse elections, as Democrats also expanded their majorities in both the New Jersey Assembly and Virginia House.",
      "The victories would mean Republicans no longer have a two-thirds majority in the Mississippi Senate when the new lawmakers take office.",
      "\u201cMississippi voters reminded us that change is possible when we show up together,\u201d Mississippi Democratic Party Vice Chair Jodie Brown wrote in a statement. \u201cBreaking the supermajority means restoring checks and balances \u2014 and ensuring that every Mississippian\u2019s voice counts in their state government.\u201d",
      "Republicans had held a two-thirds majority in the Senate since the 2019 elections. They will still have at least a three-fifths majority in the chamber.",
      "In Mississippi, a three-fifths majority of the House and Senate is needed to pass tax bills or issue bonds to borrow money. A two-thirds majority in both chambers is needed to approve proposed amendments to the state constitution and override a veto from the governor.",
      "The Democrats' gains come after a panel of three federal judges ordered the state to redraw some of its legislative districts, saying the state\u2019s 2022 legislative map diluted the power of Black voters. The judges ordered legislators to draw majority Black Senate districts around DeSoto County in the northwestern corner of the state and around Hattiesburg in the south, and a new majority Black House district in Chickasaw and Monroe counties in the northeastern part of the state.",
      "The court-ordered reshaping of voting districts played a significant role in Democrats\u2019 victories, said Heather Williams, president of the national Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.",

    "story": [
      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",
      "The next UFC event is scheduled for Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.",

    "summary": "An auction house is set to take bids on some iconic Hollywood memorabilia, from the suit worn by the \"Elf\" himself, to Marty McFly's hoverboard.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "\"It's a huge honor,\" Bailey, 37, told the magazine. \"Obviously, I'm incredibly flattered. And it's completely absurd.\"",
      "Bailey had audiences swooning as Prince Fiyero in his 2024 big-screen debut in \"Wicked,\" the popular movie musical in which he proudly urges fellow students to join him in his shallowness. The second half arrives in theaters Nov. 21.",
      "He dripped with charm as Lord Anthony Bridgerton on Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" and earned a 2024 Emmy nomination for his role in the Showtime series \"Fellow Travelers.\" Most recently, he starred in \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which came out in July.",
      "Bailey told Fallon the title was an \"honor of a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I'm sort of thrilled that People magazine have invited someone in - bestowed this honor on someone who can really cherish the value of a sexy man,\" he said.",

      "He's had plenty of stage credits since then, including starring in Shakespeare's Richard II in London earlier this year.",
      "Bailey, who has spoken openly about being a gay actor, founded The Shameless Fund, which helps to support LGBTQ+ organizations.",

      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",

      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "title": "Salman Rushdie on \"The Eleventh Hour\" and free speech",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salman-rushdie-on-the-eleventh-hour-and-free-speech/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",

      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",

      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",

      "Unused tickets can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",

      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",
      "\"Tesla's board members have asked shareholders to approve a long-term incentive package for Musk to retain and motivate the CEO to remain in his current leadership role with a new share package where he will only be paid if he attains 'extraordinary financial returns,'\" Ives said in a Nov. 5 research note.",
      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",

From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",

      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",

That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

    "summary": "The FAA will reduce U.S. air traffic by 10% at 40 U.S. locations starting on Friday due to the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that it will update its schedule once the flight reductions begin so the carrier can notify customers of any changes \"several days\" in advance.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. President Trump in August threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",

      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",

      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",

In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",

      "Starbucks unionized workers say they plan to strike on Nov. 13 \u2014 when the coffee chain will hold its annual Red Cup Day promotion \u2014 unless the company finalizes a labor contract by that date.",
      "Starbucks Workers United announced Wednesday that its members voted to authorize a strike as they push to secure a first contract that offers them better pay and more flexible hours. Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",
      "\"The ball is in Starbucks' court,\" Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and barista at Starbucks, said in a statement.",
      "If the strike happens this month, it would mark the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News the company is disappointed that the union voted to authorize a strike instead of coming to the bargaining table.",
      "\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" she said in a statement.",

      "Starbucks Workers United, which\u00a0started in upstate New York in 2021, has grown to represent more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, still a relatively small percentage of total Starbucks workers. Overall, the company has more than 200,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:05:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The shape of economic growth this year highlights the widening gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",
      "What lower-income people \"see from the grocery store, from the gas stations, is that prices are going up while their wages are not going up,\" Nguyen added.",
      "Lower-income households also face a toxic stew of inflation, credit card debt, student loans and mortgage loans, sapping their spending power. They also feel the pinch of a slowing job market more acutely than high-income groups, Zandi told CBS News.",
      "\"They may have a job, although if they lose one, they're having a harder and harder time getting back into the labor market,\" he said.",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-airspace-government-shutdown-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy/",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

    "summary": "The USDA said it would provide partial food stamp benefits for November, but it's unclear exactly when participants will get those funds.",
    "story": [
      "A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial\u00a0food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump wrote Tuesday in a Truth Social post that benefits will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps. CBS News spoke with three people about how losing access to federal food aid could affect them. They reside in states that have committed to sending emergency funds to local food banks to assist families enrolled in SNAP.",
      "Shatika Griffin, 45",
      "Buffalo, New York, resident Shatika Griffin, 45, said she relies on both SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children program,\u00a0to support herself and seven children, including an 11-year-old son who is autistic.",
      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",
      "Although her mother helps with child care, Griffin said her support network is limited. \"Everything is falling on my shoulders,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Baltimore, Md., resident Kelly Lennox has spent over 25 years working as a stagehand, building theater sets for arts groups including Artscape, an outdoor arts festival in Baltimore. For the last decade, she's also worked behind the scenes in film and TV as a studio mechanic.",
      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",
      "\"Because it was a hit-and-run, I have all these medical bills to pay,\" she said.",
      "The $192 she gets in monthly food stamps helps her buy fresh produce at the farmer's market, Lennox said.",
      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",
      "\"I'm going to have to make use of the pantries and work with their schedule, because if I use actual money for food, it takes away money I need to pay for my residential parking permit, gas and union dues,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Kathleen Hurd, a 64-year-old resident of Detroit, is the main caregiver for her grandson and granddaughter and manages the family's SNAP benefits.",
      "She receives roughly $390 in monthly food stamps, which Hurd said she uses to buy staples such as hamburgers, rice and potatoes. High food prices in recent years mean the payment is insufficient to cover the family's food budget, Hurd told CBS News, noting the demands of feeding her 15-year-old grandson.",
      "With her SNAP payments temporarily suspended, Hurd said she's trying to take it day by day. \"I'm really trying hard not to stress out about it,\" she said.",
      "Hurd, who has arthritis and lupus, said she has used food banks in the past when money was tight. But more recently, long lines and her health issues have made it harder for her.",

      "Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors.",
      "The deal, announced\u00a0Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises.",
      "Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday.",
      "Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading.",
      "Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus.",
      "Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box.",

      "Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022.",

      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-marketplace-obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-2026-increase-sticker-shock/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:36:58 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2026, premiums for a typical health insurance plan sold through the ACA marketplaces are projected to jump an average of 26%.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened for enrollment on Nov. 1, with the average premium for a mid-level insurance plan surging 26% this year to $625 per month, according to nonprofit health research firm KFF.",
      "That jump \u2014 the biggest increase in ACA plan rates since 2018 \u2014 is causing sticker shock for some people who rely on the program for health insurance coverage.",
      "\"I've been hearing stories about the price increases, so I've been dreading this week,\" Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas, told CBS News. When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

    "summary": "Senators took up a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at blocking President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at preventing President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela after a bipartisan group of senators warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate.",
      "The vote to advance the resolution failed with 49 supporting it and 51 senators opposing. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support it.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, would direct the president \"to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.\" The resolution had 15 cosponsors, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Paul.",
      "\"Congress should not cede its power to any president,\" Kaine told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \"If colleagues believe that a war against the narco-traffickers in the ocean or a war against Venezuela is a good idea, then put an [authorization of military force] on the table and debate and vote it, but don't just hand the power over to an executive. That runs against everything that this nation was founded on.\"",
      "The U.S. military is building up forces in waters off South America and has conducted at least 17 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific since Sept. 2, killing at least 70 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the most recent strike hours after the Senate voted, saying three \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the Caribbean.",
      "Kaine introduced the bipartisan resolution on Oct. 16, one day after Mr. Trump confirmed that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela.",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"But we're going to stop them by land also.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he had not made a decision about strikes within Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration recently began briefing lawmakers on the strikes ahead of Thursday's vote, allowing them to read the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that the administration argues justifies the strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with congressional leaders and national security committee heads on Wednesday as lawmakers in both parties demand more details on the intelligence and legal basis for the strikes.",
      "Democrats left the briefing saying that the administration's answers on the legal rationale were insufficient, but expressed confidence in the U.S. intelligence community's capabilities.",
      "\"Nothing in the legal opinion even mentions Venezuela,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Warner added that intelligence assets on alleged drug trafficking operations in the region are \"quite good,\" but argued that the U.S. should be intercepting the boats and bringing the alleged traffickers to justice.",
      "\"I'm not too worried that they're going to take out a fishing boat, because our intelligence community is very, very good. But I'm not confident that we know precisely who are in those boats and why they're there,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, disagreed with the characterization, telling reporters that \"we know the contents of the boats\" and \"we know the personnel, almost to a person.\"",
      "Kaine said Thursday the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is based on a misreading of constitutional text. Schiff added that the opinion \"is broad enough to authorize just about anything.\"",
      "\"If that opinion were to be adopted, it would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Schiff also questioned the U.S. military buildup in the region, calling it \"an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change.\" In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week, Mr. Trump said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's days are numbered. After Wednesday's briefing, Himes, a Democrat, said \"there is no apparent plans to expand this beyond what they say that they are doing.\"",
      "Kaine said some of his Republican colleagues are uncomfortable with the potential for escalation, but have not told him they plan to support his resolution. Schiff added that some of them \"may have been more comfortable with the idea when they thought it was a very short campaign, but now that it is an ongoing thing with no definite endpoint, I think the concern has increased.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution would require the U.S. to remove its armed forces from \"hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" It said U.S. actions in the region \"indicate imminent involvement\" in hostilities within or against the South American nation.",
      "In October, Senate Republicans blocked a similar effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. Kaine said he and Schiff planned to keep renewing their efforts to force votes on the war powers issue.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired Monday.",
      "When asked how the administration plans to proceed, a senior administration official told CBS News that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\" The strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,\" according to the official. The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "In a floor speech on Oct. 8, Paul said the strikes risk killing innocent people and decried the lack of due process.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "On Thursday, Paul asked why the two survivors were repatriated if they were such a threat to the U.S.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown and \n                                                  \n                                  Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social that he'd hosted a \"great call\" between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He wrote that Kazakhstan is the \"first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.\"",

      "Later Thursday, Mr. Trump hosted a summit with the leaders of Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian nations, during which the president said more countries could join the Abraham Accords.",
      "Asked by reporters what Kazakhstan's entry into the accords will mean, given that Kazakhstan and Israel already had long-standing ties, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it an \"enhanced relationship, beyond just diplomatic relations and having embassies in each other's capitals.\"",

      "U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Kazakhstan's participation in the Abraham Accords with Israel was important as it would enhance their bilateral trade and cooperation and signaled that Israel is becoming less isolated internationally, notably after massive criticism and protests over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a Thursday directive from the Trump administration.",
      "The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" \u2014 a potential drain on U.S. resources \u2014 because of their health issues or age.",
      "While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases like tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status.",
      "The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.",
      "The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.",
      "\"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions \u2014 including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions \u2014 can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\"",
      "About 10% of the world's population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's leading killer.",
      "The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, like obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.",
      "\"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.",
      "Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.",
      "\"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads.",
      "The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said.",
      "The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\"",
      "The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.",
      "\"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks.",
      "Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy.",
      "They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.",
      "But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.",
      "\"Taking into consideration one's diabetic history or heart health history \u2014 that's quite expansive,\" Genovese said. \"There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite expansive as opining over, 'What if someone goes into diabetic shock?' If this change is going to happen immediately, that's obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.\"",

The Justice Department on Thursday appealed Fitzpatrick's decision, writing in a court filing: \"The order exceeds the scope of the Magistrate Judge's delegated authority and was entered without the necessary findings that the defendant has shown particularized and factually based grounds exist for disclosure and that the need for disclosure outweighs the long-established public interest in grand jury secrecy.\"",
      "Comey was indicted last month after public pressure from President Trump on Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, and is charged with one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago pertaining to whether or not Comey had authorized leaks to the media during his time as FBI director.",
      "The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. That alleged anonymous source is Daniel Richman, a longtime friend of Comey's and a Columbia University law professor. Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to charges against Comey.",
      "The evidence at issue Wednesday is troves of data that the Justice Department gathered between 2019 and 2020 in a past Justice Department investigation during the first Trump administration known as \"Arctic Haze.\"",
      "The investigation, detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year, sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe. No one was charged in the investigation.",
      "One of Comey's attorneys, Rebekah Donaleski, said there are four different warrants that were executed on Richman in the \"Arctic Haze\" investigation that she knows of and evidence returned from those seizures could be used as part of the Justice Department's case against Comey. She said nobody on Comey's legal team has been given access to that information yet, and they have not been able to screen that data, which includes hard drives and phone and email records, for potentially privileged information that could have been used in the indictment.",
      "Comey attended the hearing but did not speak.",
      "Nathaniel Lemons, a North Carolina-based assistant U.S. attorney who was tapped to lead the prosecution in Virginia alongside Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, argued for the Justice Department on Wednesday.",
      "Lemons said the materials are \"isolated on a desk in FBI headquarters\" and that investigators were \"not going to touch this evidence until the court approves\" a plan for handling it.",
      "Fitzpatrick ordered the Justice Department to not look at the material themselves until the court resolves any potential privilege claims asserted by Comey and his legal team, and said that the Justice Department can use evidence it believes to not be privileged \"at their own risk.\"",
      "Donaleski said she is \"gravely concerned\" about the Justice Department's handling of the evidence, and said it is possible that the way information has been withheld in this case so far is unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "\"We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today,\" the judge said, adding that Comey's legal team is \"entitled to this information quickly.\"",
      "Patrick Fitzgerald, another attorney for Comey, said that they are working through massive amounts of evidence in the case, which includes classified information. Fitzgerald said he has not been able to access that classified information yet because he has faced delays in getting his security clearance approved.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge John McConnell ordered the Trump administration to provide the full food stamp benefits by Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Rhode Island judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to provide full federal food benefits to states by Friday and admonished the government for what he said is its defiance of an earlier order.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell told Justice Department lawyers that it is \"simply unacceptable\" to wait any longer before providing the full payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and instead said the administration should act swiftly.",
      "\"Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,\" McConnell said. \"This should never happen in America.\"",
      "The judge granted a request from municipalities and nonprofit organizations to order the administration to provide the full food benefits. He declined to pause his decision, arguing that \"people have gone without for too long.\"",
      "McConnell also accused the Trump administration of withholding SNAP benefits \"for political reasons,\" citing statements by President Trump earlier this week, in which he said the food stamp funds would only be released \"when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "The Justice Department quickly appealed McConnell's order. Vice President JD Vance called the ruling \"absurd\" at an unrelated White House event Thursday evening.",
      "\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\" Vance said.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the municipalities and nonprofits, praised the decision from McConnell, calling it a \"major victory\" for the 42 million Americans who receive food aid.",
      "\"The court could not be more clear \u2014 the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people's lives by delaying SNAP payments they are obligated to issue,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The White House clarified that it is complying with an earlier order from McConnell that required the Trump administration to tap into a contingency fund to provide SNAP benefits for November. The USDA notified states late last month that the food aid would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown, which entered its 37th day Thursday.",
      "The Justice Department told the court earlier this week that the USDA would comply with the order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds.\" A USDA official overseeing SNAP said in a declaration Monday that roughly $4.6 billion in reserve money would be used to cover 50% of eligible households' allotments.",
      "The agency \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November,\" the official, Patrick Penn, said.",
      "He then told the court in a filing earlier Thursday that benefits will actually be reduced by 35% instead of halved after the USDA conducted further calculations. As a result, eligible Americans will receive up to 65% of their benefits, more than the initial 50% that states had been directed to implement earlier this week.",

      "Stefanik, a frequent critic of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, has been hinting for several months at the possibility of running in the 2026 election.",
      "In May, President Trump put out what one political expert described as \"a loud message\" that he wants to clear the Republican field for Stefanik by endorsing both Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman and Rep. Mike Lawler for reelection. Blakeman and Lawler have both previously expressed interest in a gubernatorial run.",
      "Lawler\u00a0later announced he intends to run for reelection in 2026. Sources say Blakeman is still considering joining the race.",
      "On the Democratic side, Hochul is facing a primary challenge from her lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.",
      "In 2014, Stefanik, at age 30,\u00a0became the youngest woman elected to Congress. She represents the 21st Congressional District in upstate New York and has been reelected five times.",
      "In November 2024, Mr. Trump nominated Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for a confirmation hearing in January, but two months later, the president withdrew her nomination, saying he wanted her to remain in Congress.",
      "\"As we advance our America First Agenda, it is essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \"With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News in May, Stefanik said she was strongly considering running against Hochul, calling her \"the worst governor\" in the country. Hochul responded in a separate interview, saying, \"I look forward to that fight, no matter who it is. It's not settled yet, but I say bring it on.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday announced a deal to drastically lower the price of weight loss drugs for some Americans.",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that the two world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drug \u2014 I call it the fat drug, remember \u2014 at drastic discounts,\" the president announced in the Oval Office.",
      "Under the deal, Eli Lilly, the maker of Zepbound, and Novo Nordisk, the company behind Ozempic and Wegovy, have agreed to lower the price of their weight loss drugs for eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and for eligible users of the\u00a0planned \"TrumpRx\" pharmaceutical website.",
      "The price per month for most eligible people will be $245 to $350 a month on average, administration officials said. The cost for the drug now is as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "\"You think it was easy dealing with these people? It wasn't,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to pharmaceutical company executives. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said this agreement took \"months and months\" of negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also agreed to provide all their other medications at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning Americans will pay a competitively low price like the consumers in other countries do.",
      "The Oval Office event was cut short when one of the company attendees fainted, and members of the press were ushered out of the room. \"The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "A representative from Eli Lilly said the person was a guest of the company and had a \"brief medical situation,\" but was \"receiving the best medical care.\"",
      "Details of the weight loss drug price deal",
      "TrumpRx, which is expected to launch as early as the end of this year, will allow customers to buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies without going through insurance.",
      "When purchased through TrumpRx, the cost will be around $350 per month for injections of Ozempic and Wegovy, officials told reporters on a briefing call. The new pricing will go into effect in January.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration later approves similar GLP-1 drugs intended to be taken orally, the initial dose of those pills will be $149 per month through TrumpRx, the officials said.",
      "For eligible patients on Medicaid and Medicare, officials said the cost will be $245 for Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. The Medicare copay is $50.",
      "Administration officials hope the new pricing kicks in for Medicare in mid-2026, likely by July. For Medicaid, the timing will be based on states' willingness to participate.",
      "Not everyone will be eligible for the lowest prices. According to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on a call ahead of the president's announcement, the lower costs will be available for the following Medicare patients:",
      "Patients with a BMI over 27 who have also been diagnosed as pre-diabetic, or who have had a stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease;\u00a0Patients with a BMI over 30 who also have stage-three kidney disease or other qualifying comorbidities;Patients with a BMI over 35, which represents severe obesity.",

      "Patients with a BMI over 30 who also have stage-three kidney disease or other qualifying comorbidities;",
      "Patients with a BMI over 35, which represents severe obesity.",
      "Senior administration officials said they believe about 10% of Medicare patients will be eligible for the lower prices. The new pricing could save about $170 billion over time from the reduced risks of obesity in the Medicare population, one official said.",
      "About 40% of Americans are obese, according to CDC data, though a recent survey suggests the rate has started to decline. Research shows obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States.",
      "\"This is not about losing weight \u2014 this is about making America healthy again,\" said another official on the call. \"This is about preventing strokes, this is about preventing end-stage renal disease. So, given that, we are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it.\"",
      "Other prescription drug websites such as GoodRx won't be partnering with TrumpRx, administration officials told CBS News. Pharmaceutical companies will decide how to fulfill consumers' orders \u2014 via their own in-house logistics or by partnering with a third-party platform, one official said.",
      "The administration announced plans for the TrumpRx initiative earlier this fall, and has struck deals with several other major pharmaceutical companies. But some analysts say the \"most-favored-nation\" pricing being promised could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously floated the possibility of lower prices for weight loss drugs and expressed dismay about the high costs.",
      "\"I call it the fat pill or the fat drug,\" he said at an event on drug prices in September. \"Sometimes it works, I guess, for people. The ones I've seen, it hasn't worked so well. I've got a lot of friends, they're fat. They said, 'Yeah, I lost some weight.' I said, 'Yeah, don't look it to me.'\"",
      "Kennedy said the administration is also working to get healthier foods into schools and the military, and to increase physical activity in schools. The administration expects to release new dietary guidelines soon, Kennedy said.",
      "\"In the meantime, there is nothing more important that we can do than lower this price,\" Kennedy said.",

      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has wielded enormous power in Congress and in the Democratic Party for decades, announced on Thursday that she will not seek reelection and will retire from Congress after her term ends in early 2027.",
      "Pelosi, 85, made her decision public in a video released Thursday morning that begins as a letter to the people of the San Francisco area, whom she has represented in the House since she was first elected in 1987.",
      "\"I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,\" Pelosi says in the nearly six-minute video. \"With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative.\"",
      "\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi says. \"We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way. And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"",
      "Pelosi's decision was months in the making. While she had drawn some Democratic challengers in her San Francisco area district, she has repeatedly expressed confidence that she would once again win her party's nomination, should she run again.",
      "Pelosi served as speaker from 2007 to 2011 and again from\u00a02019 to 2023. She was the first woman to ever serve as House speaker and built a reputation for both legislative success, including passage of the Affordable Care Act, and for shrewd leadership, with her influence over House Democrats widely seen as unusually strong, even as she sometimes faced critics and complaints. Since leaving the speakership, she has remained a confidant and ally of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who is spearheading Democratic efforts to win back the majority in 2026.",
      "As recently as last month, Jeffries told CBS News he had not had any conversations with Pelosi about whether she should run for reelection or retire.",

Pelosi then praises the city for addressing challenges head on, including HIV/AIDS, which has long been a focal point for her in Congress, where she advocated for policy changes and funding.",
      "She then speaks in the video over soft, piano music with reflections that weave together her perspectives on her district and the country with an urgent, future-focused message about the continued need for leadership, be it on domestic policy or foreign policy, where she built a career as an outspoken proponent of human rights.",

    "summary": "ICE's detainee population is at the highest level on record as President Trump intensifies his crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 and just over half did not have criminal charges or convictions, according to data obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The number of detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody increased to 66,000 this week, setting a new record high as President Trump intensifies his crackdown on illegal immigration, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Never before has ICE held so many detainees facing deportation at any given time, according to officials, historical data and immigration policy experts.",
      "ICE's detainee population has ballooned by nearly 70% since Mr. Trump took office for a second time in January, when ICE was holding around 39,000 individuals in its detention system. The previous high before Mr. Trump's second administration was recorded during his first term, in 2019, when ICE held about 56,000 detainees at one point, according to government figures compiled by researchers at Syracuse University.",
      "ICE detains immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally or other noncitizens the government seeks to deport until their cases are adjudicated, unless they are granted bond or released on humanitarian grounds.",
      "Historically, the agency's detention system has mostly consisted of for-profit prisons and county jails. But, under the second Trump administration, that detention network has been supplemented by military installations and facilities in Republican-led states that have been converted into immigration holding sites.",
      "ICE now has enough detention beds to hold as many as 70,000 detainees at any time, up from its 41,500 bed capacity at the beginning of the second Trump administration, a U.S. official told CBS News. That capacity is expected to continue increasing, as ICE received $45 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act just to expand detention levels. Officials have talked about using the unprecedented infusion of funds to operate 100,000 detention beds.",
      "Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, said the genesis behind the dramatic expansion of immigration detention under Mr. Trump is a question of supply and demand. He noted there's a greater need for detention space since the administration has given ICE and Border Patrol agents a broad mandate to arrest anyone in the U.S. illegally, even if they are non-criminals who were not the original targets of operations.",
      "\"The net has hugely widened because of the collateral arrests,\" Chishti said.",
      "The internal Department of Homeland Security figures show just over half \u2014 or around 33,000 \u2014 of the individuals in ICE detention as of Thursday morning did not have criminal charges or convictions and were being held solely because of civil immigration violations. ICE calls them \"immigration violators.\" The other half, nearly 33,000 detainees, had criminal charges or convictions, according to the data.",
      "Since the summer, the fastest growing group of detainees initially arrested by ICE \u2014 as opposed to those transferred to the agency's custody by Border Patrol agents \u2014 has been comprised of unauthorized immigrants who lack criminal records, government figures show.",
      "It's unclear how many of those in ICE custody with criminal records have been convicted of or charged with violent or serious crimes, as opposed to misdemeanors or immigration-related crimes.",
      "ICE's detainee numbers fluctuate frequently, as the agency routinely deports or releases individuals and admits new detainees. Releases have become less common under the second Trump administration, which has made those who illegally entered the U.S., no matter how long ago, ineligible for bond.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said looking at those arrested by ICE since Mr. Trump took office \u2014 as opposed to those currently in custody \u2014 would provide a more \"accurate account of criminality.\"",
      "\"70% of illegal aliens ICE has arrested have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S,\" McLaughlin said. \"And this statistic doesn't even account for those wanted for violent crimes in their country of origin or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists.\"",
      "Chishti, the Migration Policy Institute senior fellow, said the expansion of detention levels has also been driven by ambitious targets some Trump administration officials have set, including what he called \"elusive\" goals to carry out 3,000 immigration arrests per day and 1 million deportations each year.",
      "Internal DHS data indicates ICE has carried roughly 278,000 arrests since Mr. Trump's second term started, or an average of 965 a day. When including arrests by Customs and Border Protection, the tally increases to over 520,000, or around 1,800 per day, though that includes CBP arrests along the borders with Mexico and Canada.",
      "Deportations by ICE under the second Trump administration stand at around 380,000, according to DHS figures. When including self-departures tracked by DHS and repatriations by CBP \u2014 which include removals of migrants who never lived inside the U.S. \u2014 the second Trump administration has recorded more than 570,000 repatriations, the data shows.",
      "Chishti said he's concerned conditions inside ICE facilities could deteriorate amid the rapid growth in detention levels.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge in Chicago ordered ICE to rectify what he called \"serious conditions\" at a processing facility in Broadview, Illinois, that has been the site of protests for weeks. He directed ICE to give detainees clean sleeping mats, three meals a day, showers, hygiene products and access to phone calls.",
      "DHS officials have repeatedly denied allegations of substandard conditions at ICE facilities.",
      "\"As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman.",

    "summary": "A Texas-based researcher produced a 26-page study for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue, which she alleges was \"pirated\" by other attorneys.",
    "story": [
      "A Texas-based researcher has filed several lawsuits against lawyers who represented defendants in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, alleging some of the attorneys \"pirated\" her research and used it in court \u2014 without paying for it.",
      "The lawsuits, filed by Lindsey Olson, allege the defense attorneys infringed on the copyright on her research studies when they made filings in court seeking a change of venue for Capitol riot defendants.",
      "Olson's research firm produced a 26-page study in April 2022 for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue out of Washington, D.C. Among the many findings in Olson's survey, respondents in Washington, D.C. were likely to characterize Jan. 6 as an \"insurrection,\" \"racially motivated\" or \"planned in advance\" than prospective jurors in other regions of the country. The survey also argued the jury pool in Washington, D.C., was more likely to feel \"personally\" affected or less safe because of the Capitol siege by the mob of Trump supporters.",
      "Dozens of Jan. 6 defendants sought a change-of-venue, several using Olson's research study in their arguments.\u00a0 None of them succeeded in their arguments.\u00a0 But Olson's lawsuits allege some defense attorneys used her study in court, without paying her a fee for her service or the rights to use her material.",
      "James Bartolomei, a civil attorney representing Olson in her lawsuits, told CBS News, \"Each lawyer exploited the entire written report for the very same purpose that she created it, which was for use in support of a motion to transfer venue out of DC. The report has a fair market value of $30,000 per case.\"",
      "One of Olson's lawsuits alleged D.C.-based defense attorney Kira West \"pirated a copyrighted expert report and used that report in three separate criminal cases for the very purpose the report was originally created.\" A CBS News review found Olson's research was included in court motions filed by West in multiple cases, including her defense of Alex Harkrider, who was accused of carrying a tomahawk axe while amid the mob. He was found guilty in 2024 of felony charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Harkrider, along with roughly 1,500 other Jan. 6 defendants, was pardoned by President Trump on Inauguration Day 2025.",
      "West declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Another lawsuit was filed against Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, who represented Federico Klein in his Jan. 6 trial. Klein, a Marine veteran and former Trump appointee who worked in the State Department's office of Brazilian and Southern Cone Affairs from 2017 until his resignation on Jan. 19, 2021, was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison for his role in the riot. He was also pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Olson has also filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging federal public defenders also misappropriated her jury research while defending Jan. 6 defendants. She alleges federal defenders published her report, in its entirety, at least 11 separate times. The suit alleges Olson \"was unaware of the government's unauthorized use until she stumbled upon a copy of her report with a file stamp of multiple illegible case numbers stamped on top\" of\u00a0 other case numbers.\"",
      "Olson's lawsuit against the Trump administration argues, \"The Government, through the public defenders alleged above, directly benefitted financially from copyright infringement of the April 2022 Report by not paying Plaintiff a reasonable fair market value licensing fee for each use of the Report, which is $30,000 per use.\"",
      "The lawsuit said, \"In exchange for a $30,000 fee, Plaintiff licensed a copy of the Report to the Requesting Attorneys, authorizing them to use it in support of their motions to transfer venue based on alleged prejudicial bias in the District of Columbia's jury pool.\"",
      "Judges universally denied requests by Capitol riot defendants to transfer their cases to other federal districts in America, despite repeated claims that jurors would be biased in the District of Columbia, due to media coverage and personal connections to victims of the attack.",
      "In a statement to CBS News through her attorney, Olson said, \"if everyone stole authors' work all the time, there would eventually be none made at all.\u00a0 Everyone understands that would be wrong.\"",
      "Some judges derided the change-of-venue requests and arguments. A CBS News review of Jan. 6 case hearings found in April 2024, a federal judge denied such a request from a riot defendant and remarked that \"while there has certainly been significant media coverage of Jan. 6, much of it has consisted only of straightforward, unemotional factual accounts of events.\"\u00a0 In July 2023, federal judge Rudolph Contreras rejected another riot defendant's request and ruled, \"a fair trial is possible even where that impact is a result of particularly heinous crimes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to enforce for now its policy ending the use of the \"X\" marker on passports and requiring the documents to reflect the passport-holder's \"biological sex at birth.\"",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing the policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year. The injunction allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared to split 6-3 in the decision, with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "\"Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth \u2014 in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,\" the court said in an unsigned decision. \"And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex 'lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'\"",
      "The court said in its order that the Trump administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and wrote that the district court's decision to provide broad relief blocks enforcement of an executive branch policy \"with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.\"",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the harms to the plaintiffs challenging the new rules outweigh the government's interest in immediately implementing the passport policy.",
      "Without relief, transgender Americans \"are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other,\" Jackson wrote. \"The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice \u2014 before their legal challenges have even been resolved \u2014 is palpable.\"",
      "She was joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the district court in Massachusetts interfered with the president's exercise of his foreign policy powers with its June ruling. It also said it has been the government's policy since 1977 \u2014 with the exception of during the Biden administration \u2014 to not allow passport applicants to self-select their preferred sex designation.",
      "\"Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex \u2014 especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive reversed a policy adopted by the Biden administration that let passport applicants choose their sex marker on the document based on their gender identity and added the \"X\" marker as an option for those who are nonbinary or don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "The president's measure defined \"sex\" as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively stopping applicants from choosing a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the \"X\" marker and changed applications to offer only the \"M\" or \"F\" designations. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought a court order that required the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy and allow them to self-attest as to their sex, including by selecting the \"X\" marker.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued a temporary order in April siding with the plaintiffs, finding in part that the State Department \"failed to offer a reasoned explanation\" for the new passport policy. Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, also ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and discriminates based on sex.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group \u2014 transgender Americans \u2014 who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her decision.",
      "In June, she extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who would seek a new passport that reflected a sex designation aligning with their gender identity or wanted a passport with the \"X\" designation.",
      "Kobick required the Trump administration to allow those passport applicants to self-select a sex marker \u2014 including the \"X\" designation \u2014 that corresponds with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected the administration's request.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He wrote that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking the plan's enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",
      "\"The question is whether the Constitution requires the government to adopt respondents' preferred definition of sex. It does not,\" Sauer wrote, adding that the passport policy defines sex in terms of biology, not self-identification.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, however, said the State Department has for decades allowed changes to passport sex markers to align with the applicant's gender identity.",

    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:31:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A man who was charged with throwing a sandwich at a federal agent was found not guilty of one count of misdemeanor assault by a jury in Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A man who was charged with throwing a sandwich at a federal agent was found not guilty of one count of misdemeanor assault after a jury trial in Washington, D.C.",
      "The acquittal of the man, Sean Dunn, comes after federal prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment against him from a grand jury in Washington in the immediate aftermath of the incident. He instead faced a federal misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.",
      "According to charging documents, Dunn threw a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a Customs and Border Patrol officer stationed at a busy intersection in Northwest Washington in August. The incident was widely publicized and quickly became a symbol of resistance against President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital, which is now in its third month.",
      "In video of the incident that was cited in the charges and played in court, Dunn can be seen yelling at the agent and other officers in his vicinity before throwing the wrapped sandwich at the officer's chest. Dunn attempted to flee on foot before being apprehended, documents and video of the incident shows.",
      "According to the affidavit, Dunn yelled, \"F*** you! You f***ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city,\" before crossing the street. He later returned and threw the sandwich.",
      "\"He did it, he threw the sandwich,\" Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statement to a D.C. jury, adding their client has \"very strong feelings\" about the Trump administration's influx of federal law enforcement into D.C.",
      "Gatto called the viral incident a \"harmless gesture that did not, could not, cause injury.\"",
      "Customs and Border Patrol Agent Gregory Lairmore, who was hit with the footlong sub, testified Tuesday, saying that he caught most of Dunn's anger and attention before being hit in his ballistic vest with the Subway sandwich.",
      "To laughs from the crowded courtroom, Lairmore said he \"could feel it through his ballistic vest\" and it \"exploded all over\" him. He said he \"could smell the onions and mustard\" on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.",
      "Dunn did not testify in his own defense, and his legal team did not present a counter to the Justice Department's arguments in the case. Instead they moved to dismiss the case, but that was denied by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who oversaw the trial.",
      "During closing arguments in front of a fully packed courtroom, prosecutors said that \"this case is not about someone with strong opinions ... it's about an individual who crossed the line.\" They said Dunn had the right to express his anger at the federal agents, but he did not have the right to strike them, \"even with a sandwich.\"",
      "\"Here we have the defendant, throwing a sandwich, but he's throwing it hard,\" the prosecutor said. \"That meets the definition of force.\"",
      "Dunn's attorney, Sabrina Schroff, then argued to the jury that \"the sandwich that was thrown in this case was not forcible,\" and equated her client's actions to that of a child's bedtime temper tantrum.",
      "Schroff said that when a child \"takes that stuffed animal with which he sleeps ... and throws it at you \u2026 Are you offended? Are you scared you might suffer bodily injury? No.\"",
      "She also said Lairmore could not have been assaulted because the sandwich throw did not place the officer in \"reasonable fear of immediate bodily harm.\"",
      "\"Think about where the sandwich landed,\" Schroff said, arguing that Lairmore's bulletproof vest that Dunn threw the sub at was \"definitely going to keep you safe from a sandwich,\" if it protects against gunfire.",
      "\"A footlong from Subway could not and certainly did not inflict bodily harm,\" Schroff said.",
      "\"This isn't just a sandwich, this is a seven minute tirade,\" prosecutors argued in their rebuttal.",
      "After his arrest, Dunn was fired from his job as a paralegal in the Justice Department. According to a Justice Department source, Dunn worked at the Office of International Affairs within the department's Criminal Division as a paralegal.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zohran-mamdani-exit-polls-how-he-won/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Entering the mayoral race with under 1% support, Zohran Mamdani's prospects of winning initially seemed unlikely. Here are some of the ways he turned the race around.",
    "story": [
      "When Zohran Mamdani launched his mayoral campaign a year ago, he was a relatively unknown state assemblyman polling at under 1%, but on Tuesday, he\u00a0coasted to victory with over 50% support in the highest-turnout race for mayor in decades \u2014 and a much higher share of young voters cast ballots in this election than in the last two mayoral elections.",
      "How did he do it?",
      "Affordability was one avenue. The 34-year-old democratic socialist offered a series of proposals aimed at making notoriously expensive New York City more affordable for people who live there, promising free busing, city-run grocery stores, rent freezes, universal childcare \u2014 to be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. As one political science expert suggested, it helped that people seemed to believe he could deliver.",
      "Drew Engelhardt, an assistant professor of political science at Stony Brook University, tracked the mayoral race and said he thinks voters were willing to gamble on Mamdani because they feel he's a \"credible messenger\" for their concerns.",
      "\"Even if his desired policy agenda faces high hurdles, folks would be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he's potentially seen as best at understanding the concerns about people like them,\" said Engelhardt.",
      "Mamdani's promises on affordable housing did resonate with voters \u2014 CBS News exit polls found an overwhelming majority of voters said that housing costs are a big problem.",
      "The exit polls and a\u00a0neighborhood-by-neighborhood analysis of Tuesday night's results indicated Mamdani won middle-income voters and renters \u2014 while higher-income homeowners broke for his opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "Similar to Trump: finding and turning out new voters",
      "President Trump is already routinely disparaging Mamdani as a \"communist\" and has threatened to cut off funding to New York City over his election. But some political analysts say the 34-year-old's outsider appeal bears some resemblance to President Trump's own improbable 2016 election bid. Both men proved they were able to engage people who otherwise would not have been excited about the election, and were able to find new voters in places other candidates could not.",
      "Take social media, for instance: Mamdani's TikTok account has 1.7 million followers, dwarfing the accounts of Republican opponent Curtis Sliwa, who has 200,000 and Cuomo, who has 15,000.",
      "The mayoral race turned out over 2 million New Yorkers to vote this year, the highest turnout the city has seen in a mayoral race since 1993. Part of this growth came from new voters: Large numbers of voters were young \u2014 and many new voters were casting ballots in their first mayoral election.",
      "Data from the New York City Board of Elections indicates that of the two million voters who cast ballots in person, 42% were under age 45 \u2014 a much higher share than in recent mayoral races. In 2021, just 27% of those who voted for New York City mayor were under 45.",
      "Mamdani carried 70% of voters under age 45, and 66% of those voting for mayor for the first time, according to CBS News exit polling.",
      "Democratic Party fatigue",
      "Englehardt also suggested that Mamdani's rise coincides with instability inside the Democratic Party.",
      "A recent Pew Research poll showed three-quarters of Americans are frustrated by the Democratic Party. Among New York City voters who view major parties unfavorably, two-thirds voted for Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani \"tapped into that sense of frustration,\" Engelhardt said, pointing out that the mayor-elect often painted his opponents as tired politicians offering more of the same old-school politics. Mamdani derided Cuomo and Sliwa in an October debate for \"clinging to the past because that's all they know.\"",
      "Cuomo sought to counter this by attacking Mamdani's thin resume and lack of experience, telling him at the same debate, \"You have never had a job; you've never accomplished anything,\" said Cuomo. \"There's no reason to believe you have any merit or qualification for 8.5 million lives.\"",
      "That argument fell flat, possibly because voters were tired of what establishment Democrats have had to offer. Democratic Mayor Eric Adams dropped his reelection bid amid ethics scandals that included federal bribery charges, which the Justice Department later dropped as Adams agreed to help the Trump administration with immigration enforcement.",
      "Engelhardt says voters appreciated that Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, did not have longstanding ties to the party.",
      "\"He was not with the establishment, and he did not have old standing, so he was part of change,\" said Engelhardt.",
      "Kabir  Khanna\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",
      "Fifteen of those airports are included on a list obtained by CBS News of potential airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",

That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",

    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday with CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio, Japanese security analyst Narushige Michishita said if the U.S. does resume nuclear explosives testing, it would be \"good news and bad news.\"",
      "\"Good news is that the U.S. is serious in bolstering its nuclear deterrence,\" said Michishita, the executive vice president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and Non-Resident Fellowship at the Atlantic Council. He explained that Japan, as a non-nuclear armed nation, relies heavily on the deterrent protection offered by its American allies, amid heightened tension with its neighbor China.",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he said the government and people of Japan \u2014 the only country on earth to ever have had\u00a0nuclear weapons used\u00a0against it in warfare \u2014 \"have been working very hard to create a world without nuclear weapons.\"",
      "If he could sit down for a candid conversation with President Trump, Michishita said he \"would like to tell him to think in an objective and very sober and low-key manner, without exaggerating or without agitation, agitating the crisis, think about how to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence and take necessary steps, while sending the message to the world that we must not fight nuclear war again.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-arguments/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:28:33 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over whether a federal emergency powers law authorizes President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, as the justices tested a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court weighed the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term. Arguments spanned nearly three hours, with the justices asking probing questions of lawyers for the Trump administration and a group of small businesses challenging the legality of the president's tariffs.",
      "But several of the justices appeared uncomfortable with the breadth of power Mr. Trump is asserting without Congress clearly authorizing him to levy broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "Several justices noted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA, which the president has relied on to impose the duties, does not mention the word \"tariff,\" and has never before been used by a president to justify the levies, until now. The Trump administration has argued that the phrase \"regulate ... importation\" in the law gives the president authority to set import taxes.",
      "But Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer to identity any other provision of the U.S. code where the phrase \"regulate ... importation\" has been used to confer an authority to impose tariffs, while Chief Justice John Roberts said that Mr. Trump is claiming \"major authority\" to levy duties on any product from any country at any rate for any length of time.",
      "\"The statute doesn't use the word tariffs,\" Roberts said, adding that while the duties deal with foreign powers, \"the vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, raised separation-of-powers concerns and questioned the administration's assertion that Congress, through IEEPA, granted the president broad emergency authority over a foreign-affairs matter. What would stop Congress from \"abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce\" or declare war and give that power to the president?\" he asked.",
      "Once Congress delegates its authority to the president, it's difficult to reclaim, Gorsuch said, warning that the administration's theory marked a \"one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's representatives.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared sympathetic to the Trump administration's argument. He argued that Congress enacted a statute that gave the president an array of tools for responding to an emergency, and questioned why the law would allow for the imposition of a trade embargo, which may be viewed as an extreme step, as opposed to tariffs, a more targeted punishment.",
      "\"You're forcing the president to respond to an emergency ... and you're taking away the president's suite of tools when the one is much more extreme that is authorized,\" he said. \"That just seems a bit unusual.\"",
      "Kavanaugh pointed to Mr. Trump's tariffs on goods from India over its purchase of Russian oil, which the president is using to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"If that's gone, that's a tool that's designed \u2014 talk about foreign-facing, the most serious crisis in the world,\" he said. \"And that's out the window.\"",
      "Trump's tariffs",
      "Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on IEEPA to impose the tariffs.",
      "The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10%\u00a0on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are \"large and persistent\" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with other nations.",
      "But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states.",
      "The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states,\u00a0ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those \"of the magnitude\" of Mr. Trump's.",
      "Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including\u00a0raising Canadian tariffs\u00a0to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions),\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0threatening China\u00a0with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be\u00a0reducing the tariffs on goods\u00a0imported from China.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having\u00a0agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling.",
      "A key issue in the case may be how the justices view the tariffs: whether they're an exercise of the president's power over foreign affairs or a tax on American consumers.",
      "Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, opened his arguments by saying, \"Tariffs are taxes\" and noting that Constitution vested that power in Congress. Echoing Gorsuch, Katyal said that if Congress were to delegate tariffing power to the president, it would be \"a one-way ratchet.\"",
      "\"We will never get this power back if the government wins this case,\" he said.",
      "But Sauer told the high court that they are a tool to regulate foreign commerce.",
      "Roberts acknowledged the tension between the powers at issue, saying \"tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress.\" But the chief justice also described the levies as a \"foreign-facing tax,\" which involves foreign affairs, a core power of the executive.",
      "\"One thing is quite clear, is that the foreign-facing tariffs have in several situations, were quite effective in achieving a particular objective. So I don't think you can just separate it,\" he told Katyal. \"When you say, well, this is a tax, Congress's power, it implicates very directly the president's foreign affairs power.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds the tariffs to be illegal, as lower courts have done, one question is how potential reimbursements would be handled. Barrett was the only justice to ask about that process, noting that some have said the refunds of tariffs collected from U.S. importers would be \"a mess.\" Katyal said he was only representing five companies, not a class action, and the government would refund the tariffs they paid. He said there was a specialized body of case law to address refunds, though \"it's difficult.\" He suggested the court could offer prospective relief, but there are \"a lot of possibilities.\"",
      "Trump administration argues for presidential powers",
      "In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it \"one of the most important in the history of the country.\" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Underscoring the importance of the case to the Trump administration, three members of Mr. Trump's Cabinet were in attendance: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "Asked about the arguments later Wednesday, Mr. Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier a loss would be \"devastating for our country,\" calling it \"one of the most important cases in the history of our country.\"",
      "Businesses warn of economic impact",
      "On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "Katyal, who argued on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "Testing the boundaries of presidential authority",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy.",
      "\"Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,\" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. \"This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.\"",

    "summary": "Chicago-area toymaker Rick Woldenberg sued Trump over tariffs in a landmark case heard by the Supreme Court Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Rick Woldenberg says it's not in his nature, nor consistent with the mission of his Chicago-area toy business, to sit quietly in the face of an existential threat. So last April, a few weeks after the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs on so-called \"Liberation Day,\" he took action.",
      "Woldenberg sued President Trump and his top advisers, alleging in a 37-page complaint Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs amounted to an illegal \"Executive Branch power grab.\" After a lower court sided with Woldenberg in June, the Trump administration appealed, and on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard the case to decide the fate of the president's signature economic policy.",
      "\"I just wasn't willing to be led to a slaughter by the politicians,\" Woldenberg told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Maurice DuBois. \"So we did what we're allowed to do, which is to push back.\"",
      "Woldenberg heads Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its 2,000 educational toys in Asia. He has taken a path that stands in stark contrast to many top business leaders who grouse privately about the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's tariffs but stay quiet in public or try to lobby the president behind closed doors.",
      "\"I'm not a politician and this is not a political movement,\" Woldenberg said. \"This is a lawsuit over the interpretation of a law.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is being asked to weigh in on whether the president has the legal authority to levy tariffs on a foreign country in order to address a national emergency, such as the fentanyl crisis, illegal migration, or persistent trade deficits, all of which Mr. Trump has cited.",
      "Should the Court uphold his tariffs, Mr. Trump has said the decision would guarantee American prosperity. If Woldenberg prevails, the White House claims economic catastrophe would follow because the administration might be forced to pay back billions to American companies.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the U.S. would have to refund about half of the more than $200 million in tariff revenue collected this year. Woldenberg estimates a third of his 500 employees have had to shift their roles to focus on tariffs. Learning Resources has paid between $5 million and $10 million in tariffs this year so far.",
      "\"I definitely want my money back,\" he said. \"The government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "For years, Woldenberg has fought government attempts to infringe on his business. In 2009, he fought the Obama administration on tougher lead-testing rules in toys.

He has previously given to both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "On a recent Friday morning, workers at the company's 356,000-square-foot warehouse, north of Chicago, were preparing and loading shipments bound for big box retailers like WalMart and mom-and-pop toy stores nationwide.",
      "Woldenberg says factories in China and Vietnam have unique advantages: labor to assemble items like the company's ever-popular toddler cash register and source materials for products like \"BubblePlush,\" a new children's yoga ball that he expects to do well this Christmas. He said shifting production to the U.S. would be impossible.",
      "\"We can't do it,\" said Woldenberg, who took over in 1998 the business his family has run for decades. \"And we don't see our competitors doing it.\"",
      "What they have done is play \"whack-a-mole,\" reacting to almost daily swings in the tariff rate. For example, after Mr. Trump took aim at China, raising the tariff rate to 145%, Learning Resources shifted some production to India. But then in August, the president raised India's tariff rate to 50%, and Woldenberg raced to ship those products to the U.S to avoid additional penalties.",
      "\"It was like a bat-outta-hell emergency,\" he said. \"And we had until Sept. 16 to clear customs in this country and the boat sauntered in six hours late. So, that cost us 50 grand.\"",
      "Along with Woldenberg's case, the Supreme Court heard a similar case brought by five other small businesses and a group of Democratic state attorneys general. In that case, a federal appeals court ruled many of the president's tariffs are illegal.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of the most consequential of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has weighed in on an interim emergency basis on challenges to many of the president's initiatives, most recently in his bid to fire Federal Reserve commissioner Lisa Cook.",
      "Woldenberg said he's confident the Court will grant him relief.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 12:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Mayor-elect Mamdani's win in New York is cheered by his London counterpart and a former mentor in Uganda, but draws a warning from Israel's U.S. ambassador.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani's win in New York City's mayoral race has ignited passions for and against him, from pride in his birthplace of Uganda and applause from his counterpart in London to anger from Israel's top diplomat in the U.S.",
      "Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who will be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his victory left some people in Africa beaming with pride for a hometown son. Mamdani was born in the East African nation of Uganda 34 years ago, then lived in South Africa for two years before moving with his family to New York as a child.",
      "\"What a moment! It was beautiful! I am excited!\" cheered Joseph Beyanga, CEO of Uganda's National Association of Broadcasters, pumping his hands in the air as he spoke with CBS News.",
      "Beyanga said he was Mamdani's mentor when the now-mayor-elect interned at one of Uganda's top newspapers, the Daily Monitor, during a vacation when he was in high school.",
      "\"Whatever he wanted to do, there was no middle point. Always he wanted the top,\" recalled Beyanga. \"Then I realized he was not just interested in current affairs. He was interested in how the current affairs affect the people. If you're talking about big money, the budget and all that, how does this affect the last person \u2026 he was interested in how it affects the people.\"",
      "\"When it was time to interact with people, he talked to people looking straight in the eye,\" he said.",
      "Beyanga added that even 17 years after he met Mamdani, he still sees the same person in the New York City politician.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. His heart is with the people, and I don't think that will change,\" he said. \"I've seen other outlets calling him populist and opponents giving him all sorts of names. I see a man after the heart of serving people, serving the down-trodden people in society. And hey, that doesn't come far away from who he is. He is a Ugandan boy, and the Ugandan boy cares for the people.\"",
      "Beyanga compared excitement in Uganda now to the exuberance among many Kenyans and Indonesians when former President Barack Obama was first elected.",
      "\"The Ugandans are having their Mamdani moment,\" Beyanga told CBS News, \"and yes, we say if he did it, yes we can!\"",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 who became the British capital's first Muslim leader when he was first elected in 2016 \u2014 voiced solidarity with his new counterpart. Khan is currently serving his third consecutive term.",
      "\"New Yorkers faced a clear choice \u2014 between hope and fear \u2014 and just like we've seen in London \u2014 hope won,\" Khan said in a social media post. \"Huge congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on his historic campaign.\"",
      "Following Mamdani's election win, Time magazine published an article by Khan, who called it \"extraordinary\" that two of the world's most influential cities will be led by people of the same faith.",
      "\"But \u2014 in two of the most diverse cities on Earth \u2014 it's a bit beside the point,\" Khan said. \"We did not win because of our faith. We won because we addressed voters' concerns, rather than playing on them.\"",
      "\"Mayor Mamdani and I might not agree on everything. Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. Put policy differences aside, though, and it's clear that we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.\"",
      "Mamdani, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has been accused of antisemitism and being pro-Hamas, which he denies.",
      "He has also been called out for refusing to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Intifada is an Arabic word that means uprising, but which is widely viewed as a slogan inciting violence against Israel. However, during his campaign he said he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase and that it \"is not language that I use.\"",
      "\"Mamdani's inflammatory remarks will not deter us,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Dannon said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"The Jewish community in New York and across the United States deserves safety and respect. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Jewish community leaders to ensure their security and well-being.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Israel said domestic media reports and editorials covering Mamdani's win were largely split along ideological lines. Left-wing commentary generally called for Mamdani to be given a chance, while more right-wing outlets leaned the other way.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Times of Israel's front-page headline read: \"Far-left, anti-Israel candidate Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race.\"",
      "The Jerusalem Post's top featured editorial said: \"Mamdani winning in NY means antisemitism can win elections, would impact Jews globally.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",

      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",

      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani.

      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 22:48:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Senators took up a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at blocking President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at preventing President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela after a bipartisan group of senators warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate.",
      "The vote to advance the resolution failed with 49 supporting it and 51 senators opposing. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support it.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, would direct the president \"to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.\" The resolution had 15 cosponsors, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Paul.",
      "\"Congress should not cede its power to any president,\" Kaine told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \"If colleagues believe that a war against the narco-traffickers in the ocean or a war against Venezuela is a good idea, then put an [authorization of military force] on the table and debate and vote it, but don't just hand the power over to an executive. That runs against everything that this nation was founded on.\"",
      "The U.S. military is building up forces in waters off South America and has conducted at least 17 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific since Sept. 2, killing at least 70 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the most recent strike hours after the Senate voted, saying three \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the Caribbean.",
      "Kaine introduced the bipartisan resolution on Oct. 16, one day after Mr. Trump confirmed that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela.",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"But we're going to stop them by land also.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he had not made a decision about strikes within Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration recently began briefing lawmakers on the strikes ahead of Thursday's vote, allowing them to read the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that the administration argues justifies the strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with congressional leaders and national security committee heads on Wednesday as lawmakers in both parties demand more details on the intelligence and legal basis for the strikes.",
      "Democrats left the briefing saying that the administration's answers on the legal rationale were insufficient, but expressed confidence in the U.S. intelligence community's capabilities.",
      "\"Nothing in the legal opinion even mentions Venezuela,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Warner added that intelligence assets on alleged drug trafficking operations in the region are \"quite good,\" but argued that the U.S. should be intercepting the boats and bringing the alleged traffickers to justice.",
      "\"I'm not too worried that they're going to take out a fishing boat, because our intelligence community is very, very good. But I'm not confident that we know precisely who are in those boats and why they're there,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, disagreed with the characterization, telling reporters that \"we know the contents of the boats\" and \"we know the personnel, almost to a person.\"",
      "Kaine said Thursday the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is based on a misreading of constitutional text. Schiff added that the opinion \"is broad enough to authorize just about anything.\"",
      "\"If that opinion were to be adopted, it would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Schiff also questioned the U.S. military buildup in the region, calling it \"an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change.\" In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week, Mr. Trump said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's days are numbered. After Wednesday's briefing, Himes, a Democrat, said \"there is no apparent plans to expand this beyond what they say that they are doing.\"",
      "Kaine said some of his Republican colleagues are uncomfortable with the potential for escalation, but have not told him they plan to support his resolution. Schiff added that some of them \"may have been more comfortable with the idea when they thought it was a very short campaign, but now that it is an ongoing thing with no definite endpoint, I think the concern has increased.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution would require the U.S. to remove its armed forces from \"hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" It said U.S. actions in the region \"indicate imminent involvement\" in hostilities within or against the South American nation.",
      "In October, Senate Republicans blocked a similar effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. Kaine said he and Schiff planned to keep renewing their efforts to force votes on the war powers issue.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired Monday.",
      "When asked how the administration plans to proceed, a senior administration official told CBS News that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\" The strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,\" according to the official. The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "In a floor speech on Oct. 8, Paul said the strikes risk killing innocent people and decried the lack of due process.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "On Thursday, Paul asked why the two survivors were repatriated if they were such a threat to the U.S.",

      "The last monkey on the loose among several that escaped after a truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi roadway has been found and captured, authorities said Thursday.",
      "A resident who lives near the crash site called authorities to report the animal's location, and it was then \"successfully recovered,\" the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks said in a statement on social media.",
      "It was the last monkey on the loose from an Oct. 28 crash when the truck carrying 21 monkeys overturned on Interstate 59. Five monkeys were killed as law officers hunted for them in the immediate aftermath of the crash. Video from officers' body cameras showed a chaotic scene as monkeys that escaped from their wooden crates dashed around the grassy interstate median, with some running toward cars and semis on the interstate.",
      "The crash happened approximately 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson. It's not clear what caused the truck to overturn.",
      "Two other monkeys that eluded officers at the crash site were later shot and killed by civilians, who said they were protecting their families and neighborhoods. Officials had warned residents not to approach the rhesus monkeys, saying they are known to be aggressive. Rhesus monkeys, which typically weigh around 16 pounds, are among the most medically studied animals on the planet.",
      "The last monkey on the loose was found Wednesday afternoon near a home in the Vossburg area, just east of where the truck had wrecked. Brandy Smith saw the monkey when her dog started barking, she told WDAM-TV. Her neighbors called 911. Workers from one of the companies that had been transporting the truckload of monkeys across the country arrived to tranquilize the monkey, Smith said.",
      "The monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. Tulane has said it wasn't transporting the monkeys and they do not belong to the university.",
      "PreLabs, which describes itself on its website as a biomedical research support organization, said in a statement that the animals were being lawfully transported to a licensed research facility. It said the monkeys weren't carrying any known diseases. Thirteen of the monkeys that were not killed arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Rhode Island judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to provide full federal food benefits to states by Friday and admonished the government for what he said is its defiance of an earlier order.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell told Justice Department lawyers that it is \"simply unacceptable\" to wait any longer before providing the full payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and instead said the administration should act swiftly.",
      "\"Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,\" McConnell said. \"This should never happen in America.\"",
      "The judge granted a request from municipalities and nonprofit organizations to order the administration to provide the full food benefits. He declined to pause his decision, arguing that \"people have gone without for too long.\"",
      "McConnell also accused the Trump administration of withholding SNAP benefits \"for political reasons,\" citing statements by President Trump earlier this week, in which he said the food stamp funds would only be released \"when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "The Justice Department quickly appealed McConnell's order. Vice President JD Vance called the ruling \"absurd\" at an unrelated White House event Thursday evening.",
      "\"In the midst of a shutdown, we can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation,\" Vance said.",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the municipalities and nonprofits, praised the decision from McConnell, calling it a \"major victory\" for the 42 million Americans who receive food aid.",
      "\"The court could not be more clear \u2014 the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people's lives by delaying SNAP payments they are obligated to issue,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The White House clarified that it is complying with an earlier order from McConnell that required the Trump administration to tap into a contingency fund to provide SNAP benefits for November. The USDA notified states late last month that the food aid would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown, which entered its 37th day Thursday.",
      "The Justice Department told the court earlier this week that the USDA would comply with the order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds.\" A USDA official overseeing SNAP said in a declaration Monday that roughly $4.6 billion in reserve money would be used to cover 50% of eligible households' allotments.",
      "The agency \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November,\" the official, Patrick Penn, said.",
      "He then told the court in a filing earlier Thursday that benefits will actually be reduced by 35% instead of halved after the USDA conducted further calculations. As a result, eligible Americans will receive up to 65% of their benefits, more than the initial 50% that states had been directed to implement earlier this week.",

    "summary": "Abby Zwerner, 25, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old first grade student in January 2023.",
    "story": [
      "A jury awarded $10 million to former first grade Virginia teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot and seriously wounded by a 6-year-old student\u00a0in 2023, in a civil case that accused the school's former assistant principal of ignoring multiple warnings the day of the shooting.",
      "Zwerner, 25, was shot in the hand and chest by a single bullet while at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, in January 2023. Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital and underwent six surgeries. The bullet to her chest narrowly missed her heart and remains lodged there. She no longer has full use of her left hand and has left teaching.",
      "Zwerner's lawsuit had sought $40 million in compensatory damages. It\u00a0accused former assistant principal Ebony Parker of gross negligence. In the lawsuit, Zwerner said she went to Parker's office the morning of the shooting and said the boy \"was in a violent mood\" and had threatened to beat up another student. The lawsuit said Parker \"had no response\" to Zwerner's concerns.",
      "Shortly after, two students told a reading specialist that the boy had a gun in his backpack, according to the lawsuit. Zwerner told the specialist she had seen the boy take something out of his bag and put it in his sweatshirt. The specialist then searched the boy's backpack and did not find a weapon. The reading specialist told Parker about the incident, according to the lawsuit, and Parker responded that his \"pockets were too small to hold a handgun\" and \"did nothing.\"",
      "Another student then told a teacher the boy had shown him a gun in his pocket during recess. When the incident was conveyed to Parker, she said the backpack had already been searched and \"took no further action,\" according to the lawsuit. When a guidance counselor asked Parker for permission to search the boy again, she allegedly forbade him from doing so, according to the lawsuit. Parker told the counselor the boy's mother would pick him up shortly, the lawsuit claimed.",
      "The shooting, which police described as \"intentional,\" occurred about an hour later. Zwerner was the only person injured, and managed to evacuate her classroom after she was shot. A school employee restrained the boy, who said he had \"shot that b**** dead,\" according to unsealed records. While testifying in court last week, Zwerner said she believed she \"had died\" after being struck by the bullet.",
      "Zwerner's lawsuit also alleged that Parker knew the boy \"had a history of random violence\" at home and school, citing an incident the year before where he \"strangled and choked\" his kindergarten teacher. Concerns about his behavior were \"always dismissed,\" the lawsuit claimed, and the boy's parents did not agree to put him in special education classes with other students with behavioral issues.",
      "A judge previously dismissed the district's former superintendent and the school principal as defendants in the lawsuit. The superintendent was fired by the school board after the shooting, while Parker resigned.",
      "The boy was not criminally charged in the shooting. Newport News prosecutor Howard Gwynn said in March 2023 that the boy was too young to understand the legal system.",
      "The boy's mother, Deja Taylor, was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for\u00a0felony child neglect\u00a0and federal weapons charges. An attorney for the family previously said the firearm used in the shooting was locked away on a high closet shelf, but the boy said he took it from his mother's purse on her dresser. Taylor said the weapon had been secured with a trigger lock, but officials said they never found one.",
      "Parker faces a separate criminal trial in December on eight counts of\u00a0felony child neglect\u00a0after a special grand jury found that she showed a \"reckless disregard for the human life\" of other students in the school. Each count is punishable by up to five years in prison.",

      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has wielded enormous power in Congress and in the Democratic Party for decades, announced on Thursday that she will not seek reelection and will retire from Congress after her term ends in early 2027.",
      "Pelosi, 85, made her decision public in a video released Thursday morning that begins as a letter to the people of the San Francisco area, whom she has represented in the House since she was first elected in 1987.",
      "\"I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,\" Pelosi says in the nearly six-minute video. \"With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative.\"",
      "\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi says. \"We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way. And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"",
      "Pelosi's decision was months in the making. While she had drawn some Democratic challengers in her San Francisco area district, she has repeatedly expressed confidence that she would once again win her party's nomination, should she run again.",
      "Pelosi served as speaker from 2007 to 2011 and again from\u00a02019 to 2023. She was the first woman to ever serve as House speaker and built a reputation for both legislative success, including passage of the Affordable Care Act, and for shrewd leadership, with her influence over House Democrats widely seen as unusually strong, even as she sometimes faced critics and complaints. Since leaving the speakership, she has remained a confidant and ally of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who is spearheading Democratic efforts to win back the majority in 2026.",
      "As recently as last month, Jeffries told CBS News he had not had any conversations with Pelosi about whether she should run for reelection or retire.",
      "\"I strongly support any decision that she makes,\" Jeffries said. \"She is a legendary member of Congress, a legendary public servant.\"",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, a member of the California delegation, also praised Pelosi's contributions, including her efforts this week to pass Proposition 50, a ballot redistricting initiative that could net additional Democratic seats in the state.",
      "\"Nobody wants to get in her way when she wants to achieve a political outcome, and she played that role and lifted up the delegation and gave us the help and support that we needed, truly a team effort,\" Aguilar said. \"She's the greatest of all time.\"",
      "Pelosi's video announcement was not only a reveal of her decision, but a testament to her career and accomplishments.",
      "Speaking over a montage of San Francisco landmarks, Pelosi says in the video that the city has \"always been synonymous with the future\" and with diversity. Pelosi then praises the city for addressing challenges head on, including HIV/AIDS, which has long been a focal point for her in Congress, where she advocated for policy changes and funding.",
      "She then speaks in the video over soft, piano music with reflections that weave together her perspectives on her district and the country with an urgent, future-focused message about the continued need for leadership, be it on domestic policy or foreign policy, where she built a career as an outspoken proponent of human rights.",
      "Pelosi also cites her Roman Catholic faith as a keystone of her political life and quotes St. Francis of Assisi.",
      "Former President Joe Biden on Thursday hailed Pelosi as the \"best Speaker of the House in American history.\"",
      "\"When I was President, we worked together to grow our economy, create millions of jobs, and make historic investments in our nation's future,\" Biden said in a statement. \"She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama said Pelosi \"has served the American people and worked to make our country better.\"",
      "\"No one was more skilled at bringing people together and getting legislation passed \u2013 and I will always be grateful for her support of the Affordable Care Act,\" Obama said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Former Secretary of\u00a0 State Hillary Clinton echoed those sentiments.",
      "\"There will be so many things to say about the legendary Nancy Pelosi's transformational tenure in Congress\u2014but for now, let's start with 'Thank you, Madam Speaker,'\" Clinton said.",
      "At White House event Thursday, President Trump struck a different tone. Asked about Pelosi's retirement, Mr. Trump said, \"I think she's an evil woman. I'm glad she's retiring.\"",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll from the UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, Kentucky, has risen to 13, officials said Thursday.",
      "\"On my way to the Teamsters' vigil, I learned of a 13th person that died as a result of the UPS flight 2976 plane crash,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg wrote in a social media post. \"My heart is with the families, friends and colleagues of all who were lost in this week's tragedy. We will get through this together.\"",
      "None of the crash victims have been positively identified by the local coroner yet, National Transportation Safety Board officials said during a news briefing Thursday afternoon. Earlier Thursday, Greenberg said nine people were still unaccounted for following the crash.",
      "On Wednesday, the University of Louisville Hospital said two of 15 people who were brought to the hospital for treatment following the incident were in critical condition. It was unclear if the latest victim was one of those who had been hospitalized, or whether their remains were located by search crews at the crash site. CBS News has reached out to the mayor's office for clarification.",
      "The deceased are believed to include the three people aboard the plane, who were identified Thursday by UPS as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.",
      "\"Words can't express the sorrow we feel over the heartbreaking Flight 2976 accident,\" Nando Cesarone, UPS executive vice president, said in a statement.",
      "The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter had been cleared for takeoff\u00a0on Tuesday from UPS Worldport, the company's global aviation hub at Louisville International Airport, when a large fire developed in the left wing and an engine fell off, said Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.",
      "The ensuing crash and inferno destroyed the enormous cargo hauler and spread to nearby businesses, causing even more blasts and destruction in an industrial corridor just outside the airport.",
      "Greenberg described the crash site as \"horrific,\" with \"charred, mangled metal.\" Part of the plane's tail, he said, appeared to be sticking out of a storage silo.",
      "\"You hear people say, 'Oh, you only see that in the movies.' This was worse than the movies,\" Greenberg told reporters.",
      "Meanwhile, UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",
      "\"Our goal is to begin returning the network to a normal cadence,\" Mayer said.",
      "Teamsters Local 89, which represents UPS workers, scheduled a late afternoon public vigil on Thursday. The mayor encouraged the public to attend, calling it an opportunity to \"share our heartbreak\" and \"find strength to keep moving forward.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "The latest on the crash investigation",
      "The plane's last data recordings showed it had reached an altitude of 475 feet and a speed of 210 mph before crashing, Inman said Thursday.",
      "The engine's main component and pieces of engine fan blades were recovered from the airfield.",
      "Inman said UPS indicated that no maintenance work was performed before the flight \"that would delay it in any way.\" He noted that investigators will look at video to see what, if anything, was being done around the MD-11 aircraft in the preceding days.",
      "Flight records show the UPS plane was on the ground in San Antonio from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18, but it was unclear what maintenance was performed.",
      "\"We will look at every piece of maintenance done, from the San Antonio time all the way to the date of the flight. ... It's going to be a laborious process,\" Inman said.",
      "He said there was no reason to take any immediate safety actions against other MD-11 planes in service.",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",

      "The 37-year-old ex-wide receiver is facing an attempted murder charge after he was accused of grabbing a handgun from a security staffer at the May event and firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier that night, police said. The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators one of the bullets had grazed his neck.",
      "\"This is just another example of the relentless work and dedication of Miami Police Detectives, working closely with Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office, and U.S. Marshals to identify and arrest those who commit crimes in the City of Miami,\" said Miami Police spokesperson Michael Vega.",

      "\"It's a difficult situation,\" Brady said then. \"Everybody should do what they can to help him in ways that he really needs it. We all love him. We care about him deeply. We want to see him be at his best. Unfortunately, it won't be with our team.\"",

    "summary": "At least 13 people were killed and several others injured after a UPS plane crashed shortly after taking off from the Louisville International Airport on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "When Georgie Dow heard an explosion at the auto parts recycling business where she works in Louisville, Kentucky, she had no idea\u00a0a UPS aircraft had just crashed outside.",
      "Dow, the chief financial officer of Grade A Auto Parts located just south of the Louisville International Airport runway where UPS Flight 2976 was departing on a flight to Hawaii, recalled the chaos and feeling the fire as she went outside Tuesday and saw black plumes of smoke surrounding their business.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Dow told CBS News on Wednesday, the day after the crash that killed at least 13 people. \"It's chaos, you don't know what's going to happen next. What's the next thing? What's going to blow up? It's scary.\"",
      "\"I heard people yelling. Where are these people? Naming them. Does anybody know,\" she said, and recalled seeing melted clothing of employees. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "Sabit Aliyev, owner of Kentucky Truck Parts and Services, heard what he said sounded like an \"atomic bomb\" outside his shop \u2014 an explosion so intense it knocked him off his feet. Videos he took with his phone show the aftermath of the massive fireball, which surrounded the business with flames and billowing smoke.",
      "\"We're being trapped behind our business. We cannot run to the street, 'cause the fire was all over,\" Aliyev said.",
      "The UPS plane carrying up to 20,000 packages and 38,000 gallons of fuel was reaching 200 mph when it crashed shortly after takeoff. Videos show the left wing of the MD-11 aircraft on fire, and the plane was tilting to the left before exploding into a trail of flames. The plane's left engine was later seen lying on the tarmac, as investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board work to determine what went wrong.",
      "NTSB board member J. Todd Inman on Wednesday confirmed that the plane's left engine appeared to have separated from the plane. He said investigators have also identified the plane's black boxes, which suffered some fire damage but specialists \"will be able to get a good readout of applicable data\" once the boxes arrive at the NTSB's Washington, D.C., laboratory.",
      "The rest of the aircraft slammed into Sean Garber's scrap metal recycling company and other nearby businesses, including a petroleum recycling company that was \"hit pretty directly,\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.",
      "Dow, who was \"severely distraught\" following the explosion, immediately video-called him, Garber said, and he wanted to know that his son, who often works in the scrap yard, was safe. Joey Garber was with Dow at the time of the crash, but three of their employees are missing, Sean Garber said.",
      "One of the surviving employees had to jump between bales of metal as heat came over on top of him, Garber and Dow recalled. The worker spotted one of their customers whose clothes had been completely burned off, and he picked him up and took him to safety, Garber said.",
      "Cellphone footage shot by Garber's son shows the aftermath of the fiery crash. Flames and thick smoke consumed an area nearly half a mile long. Dozens of people were injured, officials said, and there are believed to be at least 9 people missing as of Thursday morning.",
      "Garber said he hasn't been able to identify who's missing because there's no power to the company system, adding that he's working with investigators to see what they can figure out.",
      "When asked about how she's feeling in the aftermath of the tragedy, Dow said, \"I think about my family. I think about my kids.\"",
      "\"You think about what was the last moment I had with this person. Would that have been the last moment that they're going to remember? I think about how I want to act going forward ... I could have died yesterday,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A UPS cargo plane's left wing caught fire and an engine fell off just before it crashed and exploded after takeoff from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, a federal investigator said Wednesday, offering the first official details about a disaster that killed at least 13 people.",
      "There was a fire in the plane's left wing and the engine \"detached\" during takeoff on Tuesday, said Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.",
      "\"There are a lot of different parts of this airplane in a lot of different places,\" Inman said during a news conference, describing a debris field that stretched for a half-mile.",
      "The plane with three people on board crashed about 5:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville International. Video showed flames on the plane's left wing and a trail of smoke.",
      "\"The plane lifted off and gained enough altitude to clear the fence at the end of Runway 17R. Shortly after clearing that fence, it made impact with structures and the terrain off of the airport property,\" Inman said.",
      "Inman said the plane's black boxes \u2014 the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder \u2014 were recovered by NTSB investigators on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "He said the black box \"suffered some heat around it, not intrusion,\" but added that \"the recorders are built for that.\"",
      "\"We feel comfortable, once we get these to our lab in D.C., that we will be able to get a good readout of the applicable data,\" Inman said. \"And that will be yet another point of information that will really help us understand what happened during this point of flight.\"",
      "Inman said the crashed plane was a 1991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that was \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter. He disclosed that the plane was currently being \"handled\" by aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.",
      "\"So whenever you hear that Boeing is a party, it is because of the merger with McDonnell Douglas many years ago,\" Inman said.",
      "Inman said about 28 NTSB investigators would be on the ground investigating the cause of the crash.",
      "The crash had a ripple effect, striking and causing smaller explosions at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and hitting an auto salvage yard, Grade A Auto Parts, though it could have been worse, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday during an earlier news conference.",
      "\"Thankfully, a local restaurant that is right there ... was missed and now is helping the search and rescue,\" Beshear said. \"Another blessing is this plane could have potentially hit the major Ford factory or the convention center, those are all close by, and did not.\"",
      "The death toll from the crash has now risen to 13 people, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post on Thursday.",
      "Based on videos of the crash, aviation attorney Pablo Rojas told The Associated Press the aircraft appeared to be struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines.",
      "\"Really, the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,\" he said.",
      "Flight records show the plane was on the ground in San Antonio from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18. Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, told AP it's too early to know whether the problem was in the engine, the structure that holds the engine or something else.",
      "\"This airplane apparently did undergo heavy maintenance within the past month, and investigators will need to comb through the maintenance records to see exactly what was done,\" he said.",
      "The MD-11F is powered by General Electric CF6-80C2D1F engines. The CF6 family of engines has been linked to a few high-profile airline accidents.",
      "In 2016, American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing 767,\u00a0experienced an uncontained engine failure and fire during takeoff in Chicago with a different version of the CF6 engine, and 21 people were injured during the ensuing evacuation. The right engine suffered a sudden rupture of its stage-two disk, and the disk separated into two pieces, the smaller of which pierced the wing's fuel tank and then flew nearly 3,000 feet, falling through the roof of a UPS facility and coming to rest on the building's floor. No one was injured in the UPS building. At the time, the FAA ordered engine inspections.",
      "And in 1989, a CF6-6 engine caused United Airlines Flight 232, a DC-10, to crash land in Sioux City, Iowa. A CF6-6 fan disk separated from the engine and damaged all three hydraulic systems. The DC-10 flew with no hydraulic power until it crash-landed at the airport. Of the 296 people aboard, 112 died and 184 survived.",

      "He was released on a $200,00 bond, secured by his parents' Texas home, after appearing in federal court in Brooklyn before separate judges overseeing the complex cases. The bond terms state that he must not gamble online or in establishments, and must not have any contact with organized crime.",
      "Jones was represented in both arraignments by a court-appointed attorney, Kenneth J. Montgomery. Montgomery said he was assigned as Jones's attorney by the CJA, an agency that appoints and retains counsel for defendants unable to pay for private attorneys. No other mention was made of Jones's financial situation during the court proceedings.",
      "Jones, who lives in Texas, is accused of participating in a pair of schemes that together saw dozens of alleged mafia figures and athletes charged on Oct. 23. One scheme revolved around alleged cheating in high-stakes poker games operated by reputed members of the mob. The other case involves bets on basketball games, which were allegedly placed using insider information related to injury reports.",
      "Jones is among three people arrested in connection with both schemes. In total, 34 people were charged across two indictments.",
      "The former Cleveland Cavaliers guard is accused of sharing or attempting to share inside information with bettors. The sports betting indictment alleges he gave others a tip about \"a prominent NBA player,\" who appears to be LeBron James, a former teammate and longtime friend. James is not accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment alleges Jones sent a text message to a co-conspirator on Feb. 9, 2023, saying: \"Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight.\" James missed the Lakers' game that night against the Milwaukee Bucks due to ankle soreness.",
      "Another defendant, Marves Fairley, appeared alongside Jones in federal court Thursday and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors allege that Fairley, a Mississippi resident, agreed to pay for information about NBA star Terry Rozier's alleged plan to leave a March 23, 2023, game early. Rozier, of the Miami Heat, is also among those charged in the case.",
      "Fairley was released on a $200,000 bond guaranteed by his wife, his pastor and a local school superintendent.",
      "Jones is separately accused of participating in an elaborate poker cheating scheme in which wealthy victims were allegedly lured to play in rigged games against athletes \u2014 referred to as \"face cards,\" prosecutors said. The indictment, which names dozens of defendants including NBA Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, claims Jones was one such \"face card.\"",
      "Billups and Rozier have not yet entered a plea in the case. They are scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 24.",
      "Prosecutors say the cheating scheme brought in more than $7 million for participants.",

      "Several alleged members of the mafia\u00a0are accused\u00a0of participating in the rigged poker schemes.

Stroud, who lives in Kentucky and was arrested there, is accused by prosecutors of bringing Jones and Billups into the conspiracy.",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in the indictment, and reiterated in court, that he was responsible for the gunpoint robbery of a person identified as John Doe #7.",
      "Prosecutors said police raided Stroud's residence in Florida in connection with this case and found poker chips and hidden cameras in the vents. They argued against reducing restrictions for Stroud, saying he has a prior conviction for reckless homicide.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 16:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of fatalities may increase after a UPS plane crashed Tuesday near the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said.",
    "story": [
      "At least 13 people were killed and more than a dozen others injured after a UPS plane crashed shortly after takeoff near the Louisville International Airport on Tuesday, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun an investigation into the crash, and said Wednesday afternoon it has recovered the black boxes that record plane data.",
      "The death toll rose several times Wednesday, with both Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg warning the number was expected to increase as several people remain unaccounted for. At least 9 people were believed to be missing as of Thursday morning, Greenberg said. The plane was carrying three UPS crew members, identified by the company as Captain Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truit and International Relief Officer Captain Dana Diamond \u2014 all of whom appear to have died in the crash.",
      "\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of our colleagues, and to the loved ones of those in the Louisville community,\" Nando Cesarone, UPS executive vice president, U.S. and UPS Airlines, said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Beshear said at a Wednesday afternoon news briefing there were \"a handful of other people that we're still searching for.\" Beshear said it's believed one of the victims is a young child.",
      "\"We do not expect to find anyone else alive,\" he said.",
      "Beshear declared a state of emergency on Wednesday.",
      "Greenberg said the Jefferson County Coroner has been at the scene and will make identifications. Beshear warned the condition of some of the remains could make identification difficult and might require testing that would take additional time.",
      "Greenberg said the owner of an auto parts business, one of the businesses that was hit by the crash, is a friend of both his and Beshear's. He said the man believes some of his employees and customers were killed.",
      "Beshear\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Wednesday that 16 families have reported loved ones who are unaccounted for, although it was not clear if any of those were part of the increased death toll from throughout the day. Search and rescue operations had ended as of Wednesday afternoon and crews were instead working on recovery, he said.",
      "Health care system UofL Health told CBS News that it received 15 patients across its several hospitals and medical centers. Thirteen of those patients were discharged Wednesday morning, and two remain in critical condition in the intensive care unit at UofL Hospital, the network said. Beshear said Wednesday afternoon that their conditions had not changed as far as he knew.",
      "UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. local time after it departed from the Louisville airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The aircraft was headed to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, when it went down three miles south of the airfield, Louisville airport public safety officer Jonathan Biven said at a news conference.",
      "According to preliminary flight data from FlightRadar24, the three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 plane appeared to hit 175 feet in altitude briefly after takeoff. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said the plane was carrying about 38,000 gallons of fuel, weighing about 233,000 pounds. That likely led to the significant fire as seen from\u00a0CBS affiliate WLKY-TV's chopper. The plane was also carrying up to 20,000 packages.",
      "Videos of the crash showed the aircraft partially on fire as it sped down the runway before it burst into flames. Other images suggest the plane's left engine separated from the plane during the fire. Debris from the separation may have been sucked into another engine, meaning the plane could not generate sufficient lift to take off.",
      "Investigators from the NTSB and the FAA arrived at the scene Wednesday morning, the aviation agency said. There are 28 NTSB investigators on the ground, McGarvey said. McGarvey said that the\u00a0ongoing government shutdown\u00a0would have no impact on the investigation.",
      "NTSB board member J. Todd Inman confirmed that the plane's left engine appeared to have separated from the plane. He said investigators have also identified the plane's black boxes. He said the devices had \"suffered some heat\" but he felt \"comfortable\" that specialists \"will be able to get a good readout of applicable data\" once the boxes arrive at the NTSB's Washington, D.C., laboratory.",
      "\"While the fire may have been intense, it is built to withstand that,\" Inman said. He noted that it would take at least several days for a readout to be made available.",
      "More than 200 first responders, including 100 firefighters, responded to the fiery crash site, Greenberg said. Dozens of emergency responders remained on the scene as of Wednesday afternoon, Okolona Fire Protection District Chief Mark Little said during the mayor's briefing.",
      "\"To be able to put out a blaze like that, and be able to stabilize a site this size from a giant airplane filled with aviation fuel, this quickly, get kids in school the next day, is pretty special,\" Beshear said.",
      "The debris field is about half a mile long, Inman said Wednesday afternoon. Greenberg said that the intense flames burned away some of the debris, including parts of the plane.",
      "Two businesses were directly impacted, Beshear said Wednesday, including a petroleum recycling facility and the auto parts business. Greenberg said oil stored in the petroleum facility entered waterways, and there were vehicles and lots of scrap metal in the auto parts business, which had complicated search efforts. The plane crashed near a Ford facility but did not hit it, Beshear said.",
      "Beshear said there was no hazardous cargo onboard the plane that would create environmental issues around the crash site, but urged residents to follow any shelter-in-place orders. There is still a shelter-in-place order for those within a quarter-mile radius of the crash site, Greenberg said Wednesday morning. All schools in the Jefferson County School District, the state's largest, with just under 100,000 students, were closed Wednesday, Greenberg said. Schools will reopen Thursday, Beshear said.",
      "Greenberg said Wednesday afternoon that power is being returned to over 100 customers and that water is safe to drink unless residents have received a specific advisory from Louisville officials. Air quality is being monitored, Greenberg said.",
      "Greenberg urged any residents who find debris on their property not to touch it, and instead report it to authorities. Beshear noted Wednesday those who reported debris would likely be visited by the FBI so it could be retrieved. He also warned that residents should avoid flying drones over the crash site, warning that the devices could \"get in the way of our recovery operations\" and that operators risk prosecution and federal fines.",
      "The airport was closed Tuesday following the crash but reopened on Wednesday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said, though multiple taxiways remain closed.",
      "Louisville International Airport is home to UPS Worldport, an international air hub for the parcel service. The 5.2 million-square-foot facility processes up to 400,000 packages an hour and employs 20,000 UPS workers. The facility sees more than 300 daily UPS flights, according to the company.",
      "Package sorting operations at the facility were paused on Tuesday night and resumed Wednesday morning. UPS said Wednesday morning that sorting for the expedited shipping service Second Day Air was canceled for the day and that employees in that department should not report to work.",
      "Some UPS packages may be delayed because of halted operations. The investigation could also cause further operational delays, if officials need to inspect or review other planes, though UPS could charter additional planes to meet delivery needs.",
      "UPS Airlines planned to operate about 25 MD-11 planes by the end of the year, and is phrasing out the aging three-engine jets for newer and more fuel-efficient two-engine freighters. The crashed plane was built in 1991, according to FAA data.",
      "The Red Cross is providing assistance to the families of victims, McGarvey said. Beshear said that an emergency relief fund has been established to help those affected.",
      "Kris  Van Cleave\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing the policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year. The injunction allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared to split 6-3 in the decision, with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "\"Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth \u2014 in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,\" the court said in an unsigned decision. \"And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex 'lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'\"",
      "The court said in its order that the Trump administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and wrote that the district court's decision to provide broad relief blocks enforcement of an executive branch policy \"with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.\"",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the harms to the plaintiffs challenging the new rules outweigh the government's interest in immediately implementing the passport policy.",
      "Without relief, transgender Americans \"are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other,\" Jackson wrote. \"The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice \u2014 before their legal challenges have even been resolved \u2014 is palpable.\"",
      "She was joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the district court in Massachusetts interfered with the president's exercise of his foreign policy powers with its June ruling. It also said it has been the government's policy since 1977 \u2014 with the exception of during the Biden administration \u2014 to not allow passport applicants to self-select their preferred sex designation.",
      "\"Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex \u2014 especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive reversed a policy adopted by the Biden administration that let passport applicants choose their sex marker on the document based on their gender identity and added the \"X\" marker as an option for those who are nonbinary or don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "The president's measure defined \"sex\" as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively stopping applicants from choosing a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the \"X\" marker and changed applications to offer only the \"M\" or \"F\" designations. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought a court order that required the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy and allow them to self-attest as to their sex, including by selecting the \"X\" marker.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued a temporary order in April siding with the plaintiffs, finding in part that the State Department \"failed to offer a reasoned explanation\" for the new passport policy. Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, also ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and discriminates based on sex.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group \u2014 transgender Americans \u2014 who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her decision.",
      "In June, she extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who would seek a new passport that reflected a sex designation aligning with their gender identity or wanted a passport with the \"X\" designation.",
      "Kobick required the Trump administration to allow those passport applicants to self-select a sex marker \u2014 including the \"X\" designation \u2014 that corresponds with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected the administration's request.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He wrote that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking the plan's enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",
      "\"The question is whether the Constitution requires the government to adopt respondents' preferred definition of sex. It does not,\" Sauer wrote, adding that the passport policy defines sex in terms of biology, not self-identification.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, however, said the State Department has for decades allowed changes to passport sex markers to align with the applicant's gender identity.",
      "\"By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives Plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",

    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect a ruling in the case early next year.",

      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",
      "Fifteen of those airports are included on a list obtained by CBS News of potential airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",

That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 22:48:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Senators took up a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at blocking President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at preventing President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela after a bipartisan group of senators warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate.",
      "The vote to advance the resolution failed with 49 supporting it and 51 senators opposing. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support it.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, would direct the president \"to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.\" The resolution had 15 cosponsors, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Paul.",
      "\"Congress should not cede its power to any president,\" Kaine told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \"If colleagues believe that a war against the narco-traffickers in the ocean or a war against Venezuela is a good idea, then put an [authorization of military force] on the table and debate and vote it, but don't just hand the power over to an executive. That runs against everything that this nation was founded on.\"",
      "The U.S. military is building up forces in waters off South America and has conducted at least 17 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific since Sept. 2, killing at least 70 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the most recent strike hours after the Senate voted, saying three \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the Caribbean.",
      "Kaine introduced the bipartisan resolution on Oct. 16, one day after Mr. Trump confirmed that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela.",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"But we're going to stop them by land also.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he had not made a decision about strikes within Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration recently began briefing lawmakers on the strikes ahead of Thursday's vote, allowing them to read the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that the administration argues justifies the strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with congressional leaders and national security committee heads on Wednesday as lawmakers in both parties demand more details on the intelligence and legal basis for the strikes.",
      "Democrats left the briefing saying that the administration's answers on the legal rationale were insufficient, but expressed confidence in the U.S. intelligence community's capabilities.",
      "\"Nothing in the legal opinion even mentions Venezuela,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Warner added that intelligence assets on alleged drug trafficking operations in the region are \"quite good,\" but argued that the U.S. should be intercepting the boats and bringing the alleged traffickers to justice.",
      "\"I'm not too worried that they're going to take out a fishing boat, because our intelligence community is very, very good. But I'm not confident that we know precisely who are in those boats and why they're there,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, disagreed with the characterization, telling reporters that \"we know the contents of the boats\" and \"we know the personnel, almost to a person.\"",
      "Kaine said Thursday the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is based on a misreading of constitutional text. Schiff added that the opinion \"is broad enough to authorize just about anything.\"",
      "\"If that opinion were to be adopted, it would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Schiff also questioned the U.S. military buildup in the region, calling it \"an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change.\" In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week, Mr. Trump said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's days are numbered. After Wednesday's briefing, Himes, a Democrat, said \"there is no apparent plans to expand this beyond what they say that they are doing.\"",
      "Kaine said some of his Republican colleagues are uncomfortable with the potential for escalation, but have not told him they plan to support his resolution. Schiff added that some of them \"may have been more comfortable with the idea when they thought it was a very short campaign, but now that it is an ongoing thing with no definite endpoint, I think the concern has increased.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution would require the U.S. to remove its armed forces from \"hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" It said U.S. actions in the region \"indicate imminent involvement\" in hostilities within or against the South American nation.",
      "In October, Senate Republicans blocked a similar effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. Kaine said he and Schiff planned to keep renewing their efforts to force votes on the war powers issue.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired Monday.",
      "When asked how the administration plans to proceed, a senior administration official told CBS News that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\" The strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,\" according to the official. The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "In a floor speech on Oct. 8, Paul said the strikes risk killing innocent people and decried the lack of due process.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "On Thursday, Paul asked why the two survivors were repatriated if they were such a threat to the U.S.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown and \n                                                  \n                                  Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Muslim majority countries, in a symbolic move aimed at boosting an initiative that was a hallmark of President Trump's first term.",
      "The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations \u2014 Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Those four countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social that he'd hosted a \"great call\" between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He wrote that Kazakhstan is the \"first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.\"",
      "Trump called Kazakhstan's joining \"a major step forward in building bridges across the World\" and said \"more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.\"",
      "A signing ceremony would soon make it official, Mr. Trump said, and \"there are many more Countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH.\"",
      "Later Thursday, Mr. Trump hosted a summit with the leaders of Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian nations, during which the president said more countries could join the Abraham Accords.",
      "Asked by reporters what Kazakhstan's entry into the accords will mean, given that Kazakhstan and Israel already had long-standing ties, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it an \"enhanced relationship, beyond just diplomatic relations and having embassies in each other's capitals.\"",
      "\"You're now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together,\" Rubio said.",
      "U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Kazakhstan's participation in the Abraham Accords with Israel was important as it would enhance their bilateral trade and cooperation and signaled that Israel is becoming less isolated internationally, notably after massive criticism and protests over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country, according to the\u00a0Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "The wine press, which is likewise the earliest relic of wine production in Israel, was found during an excavation at the archaeological site Tel Megiddo, said the agency, which noted that the work was conducted ahead of the planned construction of a highway through the same area.",
      "Officials said the wine press, which was carved from stone, was evidence that a Canaanite religious group existed at the site thousands of the years ago. The Canaanites were ancient indigenous people who inhabited the area known as Canaan, which was located in \"the Levant\" along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, from Greece to western Europe, according to EBSCO. They were a group of mixed ethnicities although the Hebrew Bible distinguishes them from Israelites and teaches that Israelites arrived later than they did.",
      "Dr. Amir Golani and Barak Tzin, excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the wine press discovery was unprecedented.",
      "\"Until now, indirect evidence indicated that wine could have been produced 5,000 years ago, but we did not have conclusive proof of this \u2013 a 'smoking gun' that would clearly show when this happened in our area,\" they said in a statement. \"This wine press finally provides new and clear evidence that early wine production actually took place here.\"",
      "In addition to the wine press, archaeologists found a model of a small temple and one set of ceremonial utensils, which were approximately 3,300 years old. Those were among a wider collection of items found during excavations in the region, which covered about three-fourths of a mile and \"uncovered many finds from different periods,\" the authority said. Their discoveries spanned the early Bronze Age, which ran from about 3300 to 3000 B.C.E., and the late Bronze Age, which ran from about 1550 to 1400 B.C.E.",
      "There was more evidence of early Canaanite populations in the area, the authority said. They included residential buildings uncovered around the wine press, ritual vessels and pottery imported from Cyprus, which are thought to illuminate some of the ancient peoples' ritual ceremonies and cultures.",

      "\"Eleven more priceless antiquities have now been recovered and returned to where they rightfully belong,\" District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said in a statement at the time. \"None of this work is possible without the dedication and commitment of our team, and I thank them for their work on these investigations.\"",

      "\"Any artifact that belongs to Egypt's heritage is important.

      "The hour-long meeting, described by the Holy See as \"cordial,\" focused on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and renewed calls for a two-state solution, a position the Vatican has consistently promoted as the only viable path to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "The talks came nearly a month after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took hold in Gaza, bringing a fragile calm following two years of conflict that began with Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "According to a Vatican statement, both leaders agreed on \"the urgent need to provide assistance to the civilian population in Gaza,\" and to \"end the conflict by pursuing a two-state solution,\" which would see an independent Palestinian state created alongside Israel.",

      "For Abbas, the meeting offered an opportunity to reaffirm international backing for a Palestinian state at a time when the idea seems increasingly remote on the ground.",
      "Abbas has said the PA, which he heads, is ready to step into post-war Gaza to administer the densely populated territory, but Netanyahu's government has rejected any future role for the PA or Hamas in the strip. Netanyahu has also clearly ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state while he is prime minister, and his coalition government includes hard-line factions that espouse building Israeli settlements in the strip instead.",
      "The American pope has echoed his predecessor's support for Palestinian rights while striking a less critical tone on Israel.",
      "He has condemned the forced displacement of civilians in Gaza and called for sustained humanitarian aid, but stopped short of labeling Israel's military operation against Hamas in the territory as \"genocide,\" as Pope Francis did late in his pontificate.",
      "The Vatican's continued advocacy for a two-state solution underscores a broader reality: While the concept remains a cornerstone of international diplomacy \u2014 championed by most governments worldwide and the United Nations, though not clearly by the Trump administration \u2014 it carries less traction in the region itself.",

      "An American man and his teenage son died last month after they were swarmed by wasps while zip lining at an adventure camp in Laos and stung many dozens of times, a hospital official said Thursday.",
      "Dan Owen, the director of an international school in neighboring Vietnam, and his son Cooper were attacked by the insects on Oct. 15 at the Green Jungle Park, as they were descending from a tree at the end of the zip line.",
      "The camp is located outside the city of Luang Prabang, a popular tourist site in the Southeast Asian nation that was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.",
      "The two were taken to a local clinic and then transported to Luang Prabang Provincial Hospital where they arrived in critical condition, said Jorvue Yianouchongteng, the emergency room physician who received them.",
      "\"The son was unconscious and passed away after half an hour, while the father was conscious and passed away about three hours later,\" he told The Associated Press. \"We tried our best to save them but we couldn't.\"",
      "The doctor said both had suffered from severe anaphylactic shock after being stung more than 100 times across their bodies, but that exact cause of death had not been determined.",
      "Phanomsay Phakan, a doctor at the clinic where the two were first treated, told CBS News the two patients stayed there for a short time because they had limited medical facilities.",
      "\"The condition of the father and son was very serious, so they were quickly transferred to a nearby provincial hospital for further treatment,\" Phakan told CBS News. \"I don't know what happened after that.\"",
      "Phakan previously\u00a0told the U.K. Times\u00a0that their bodies were covered in red spots.",
      "\"It was very, very painful,\" Phakan told the Times. \"A lot of stings, more than 100, over the whole body. I thought already that it's a very dangerous situation because I had never seen it as bad as that.\"",
      "The Asian giant hornet, known as the \"murder hornet\" due to its aggressive behavior toward other insects like bees, is found in Laos but so are several other species of wasps. It was not clear which type had stung the two. Last December, agriculture officials confirmed the Asian giant hornet\u00a0had been eradicated in the U.S. The invasive species\u00a0was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and\u00a0verified two reports\u00a0of the hornet, and efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",

      "The Green Jungle Park did not respond to a query from CBS News. The Laos Foreign Ministry did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "In a Facebook post, Owen's employer, Quality Schools International, praised him as \"touching countless lives\" during 18 years with the chain, which operates 35 schools around the world. It said he had worked at five of its schools and was director of the QSI International School of Haiphong in Vietnam at the time of his death.",

    "summary": "Typhoon Kalmaegi battered the Philippines, killing scores of people before moving on to Vietnam, and there's another potential monster storm brewing at sea.",
    "story": [
      "Nha Trang, Vietnam \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi barreled into Vietnam on Thursday after killing more than 140 people in the Philippines, making landfall north of Gia Lai province in central Vietnam and lashing the region with fierce winds and torrential rain.",
      "The storm hit as the central provinces were already reeling from days of flooding caused by record-breaking rainfall that already claimed 47 lives. Forecasters warned that Kalmaegi could dump more than 24 inches of additional rain in some areas, raising fears of deadly landslides and flash floods.",
      "Power outages were reported in several provinces, while trees were uprooted and roofs torn off homes. Authorities also warned of flooding risks in major cities, including Danang and Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "Kalmaegi killed at least 142 people and left another 127 missing after unleashing devastating flooding across the central Philippines before heading to Vietnam, official figures showed Thursday.",
      "The typhoon is so far the world's deadliest of 2025, according to disaster database EM-DAT. Trami, which also hit the Philippines, was last year's third-deadliest typhoon with 191 fatalities.",
      "Floodwaters described as unprecedented rushed through Cebu province's towns and cities this week, sweeping away cars, riverside shanties and even massive shipping containers.",
      "The national civil defense office on Thursday confirmed 114 deaths, though that tally did not include an additional 28 recorded by Cebu provincial authorities. More than 500,000 Filipinos remain displaced.",
      "In Liloan, a town near Cebu City where 35 bodies have been recovered, AFP reporters saw cars piled atop each other by floodwaters and roofs torn off buildings as residents attempted to dig out of the mud.",
      "Christine Aton's sister Michelle, who has a disability, was among Liloan's victims, trapped in her bedroom as the floodwaters rose inside their house.",
      "\"We tried to pry open (her bedroom door) with a kitchen knife and a crowbar but it wouldn't budge. ... Then the refrigerator started to float,\" Aton, 29, said.",
      "\"I opened a window and my father and I swam out. We were crying because we wanted to save my older sister. But my father told me we couldn't do anything for her, that all three of us might end up dead.\"",
      "Chyros Roa, a 42-year-old father of two, said his family was saved by his dog's barking when water rushed into their home in the early hours, giving them just enough time to reach their roof.",
      "\"The current was really strong. We tried to call for rescue, but no one came. We were told the rescuers were swept away by the current,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, President Ferdinand Marcos declared a \"state of national calamity,\" a move allowing the government to release funding for aid and impose price ceilings on basic necessities.",
      "\"Unfortunately, there's another (typhoon) coming with the potential to become an even stronger one,\" Marcos said at an afternoon press briefing.",
      "Still more than 930 miles to the country's east, tropical storm Fung-wong is slowly building strength as it heads toward the Philippines' main island of Luzon. It could reach super typhoon status before it makes landfall on Monday.",
      "State weather service meteorologist Benison Estareja told AFP the rains along Kalmaegi's path were 1.5 times the amount that would typically fall in Cebu for a full November, saying it was something that happened \"once every 20 years.\"",
      "The \"highly urbanized\" nature of the most-affected communities around Cebu City had made it even deadlier, he added.",
      "\"Around four or five in the morning, the water was so strong that you couldn't even step outside,\" said Reynaldo Vergara, 53, adding that everything in his small shop in Mandaue had been lost when a nearby river overflowed. \"Nothing like this has ever happened. The water was raging.\"",
      "In a radio interview, provincial governor Pamela Baricuatro called the situation \"unprecedented.\"",
      "Scientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful due to human-driven climate change. Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall.",
      "Vietnam, which gets about a dozen typhoons and storms a year, has been  pummeled by a relentless series this year, leaving little time to  recover between disasters.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha urged local authorities to treat Kalmaegi as \"urgent and dangerous,\" calling it \"a very abnormal\" storm in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Authorities ordered thousands to evacuate from coastal communities, and in Quy Nhon city, an AFP reporter saw officials knocking on doors Thursday and warning people to flee before the landfall.",
      "Kalmaegi is the 13th typhoon or tropical storm of 2025 to affect Vietnam. The Philippines has already reached its average of 20 such storms with Kalmaegi, state weather specialist Charmagne Varilla told AFP, adding at least \"three to five more\" storms could be expected by December's end.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 10:21:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday with CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio, Japanese security analyst Narushige Michishita said if the U.S. does resume nuclear explosives testing, it would be \"good news and bad news.\"",
      "\"Good news is that the U.S. is serious in bolstering its nuclear deterrence,\" said Michishita, the executive vice president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and Non-Resident Fellowship at the Atlantic Council. He explained that Japan, as a non-nuclear armed nation, relies heavily on the deterrent protection offered by its American allies, amid heightened tension with its neighbor China.",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he said the government and people of Japan \u2014 the only country on earth to ever have had\u00a0nuclear weapons used\u00a0against it in warfare \u2014 \"have been working very hard to create a world without nuclear weapons.\"",
      "If he could sit down for a candid conversation with President Trump, Michishita said he \"would like to tell him to think in an objective and very sober and low-key manner, without exaggerating or without agitation, agitating the crisis, think about how to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence and take necessary steps, while sending the message to the world that we must not fight nuclear war again.\"",

Rehoming the big cats was not a \"viable or humane option\" because of their \"age, number and complex needs,\" the sanctuary said in an updated statement on Thursday. The lions are between the ages of 18 and 21, which is longer than they would have lived in the wild.",
      "The park said two lions, named Imvula and Sibili, were put down on Wednesday. Both animals had \"serious health conditions that were not treatable and were deteriorating,\" the sanctuary said, and the decision to euthanize them was \"made with deep care and consideration.\"",
      "The sanctuary said the five surviving lions' wellbeing continues to be their priority and that they are still seeking a solution for the surviving lions. Some have expressed interest in purchasing the park and continuing to care for the lions, the sanctuary said, which provides \"a glimmer of hope.\"",
      "\"While the timeframe is short and the situation remains uncertain, we are doing everything we can to explore this possibility and keep hope alive,\" the park wrote on social media. The sanctuary did not specify how much time the remaining lions might have.",

      "A search continued on Thursday for one of two convicted criminals who were mistakenly released from prison the previous day in Britain \u2014 the second and third such incidents in two weeks and part of a growing trend of mistaken releases that have put the government under fire.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said it was informed by England's prison service on Tuesday afternoon that a 24-year-old was \"released in error\" from Wandsworth prison, in southwest London, on Oct. 29.",
      "The suspect has been identified as Algerian national Brahim Kaddour Cherif, who remained at large on Thursday. Police said he is a registered sex offender who was convicted of indecent exposure last year, sentenced to an 18-month community order and put on the sex offenders' register for five years.",
      "The BBC reported that Cherif last appeared in court in September, charged with failing to comply with requirements for convicted sex offenders.",
      "\"Cherif has had a six-day head start but we are working urgently to close the gap and establish his whereabouts,\" Paul Trevers, who is overseeing the police investigation, said in a statement.",

      "\"I am absolutely outraged and appalled by the mistaken release of a foreign criminal wanted by the police. The Metropolitan police is leading an urgent manhunt, and my officials have been working through the night to take him back to prison,\" David Lammy, U.K. deputy prime minister and justice secretary, said in a statement after reports emerged of the first mistaken release, according to the BBC.",
      "\"Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers. That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases which has persisted for too long,\" Lammy said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called that release \"utterly unacceptable\" and said the issue of accidental prisoner releases \"needs to be dealt with, and the system needs to be reformed and the appropriate checks need to be in place to stop this type of thing from ever happening,\" according to The Guardian.",
      "Just last week, the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian man jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, triggered a two-day manhunt and his eventual deportation. British authorities agreed to give him the equivalent of about $600 to get on a plane, rather than filing a new legal challenge to his deportation.",
      "The number of prisoners released from U.K. prisons by mistake has more than doubled in the last year, according to government data analyzed by Britain's Telegraph newspaper.",
      "About 262 prisoners were mistakenly released from March 2024 to March 2025, compared to 115 during the same period the previous year, the Telegraph reported.",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "summary": "The governor of a northern region of Japan says authorities were getting \"desperate\" due to a lack of manpower amid daily reports of bear attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo - Japan's Defense Ministry sent troops on Wednesday to the northern prefecture of Akita to help contain a surge of bear attacks that have horrified residents in the mountainous region.",
      "Bears have shown up near schools, train stations, supermarkets and even a hot springs resort, with attacks by the animals reported almost daily across Japan, mostly in the north.",
      "Since April, more than 100 people have been injured and at least 12 killed in bear attacks across Japan, according to Environment Ministry statistics at the end of October. That is the highest number of people killed by the animals in the country in one fiscal year since 2006, when the ministry started compiling the statistics.",
      "\"Every day, bears intrude into residential areas in the region and their impact is expanding,\" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fumitoshi Sato told reporters. \"Responses to the bear problem are an urgent matter.\"",
      "The Defense Ministry and Akita prefecture signed an agreement on the troop dispatch on Wednesday afternoon, allowing soldiers to set box traps with food inside, transport local hunters and help with the disposal of dead bears. The soldiers will not use firearms to cull bears, officials said.",
      "Akita Gov. Kenta Suzuki said local authorities were getting \"desperate\" due to a lack of manpower amid daily reports of bear attacks.",
      "Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Tuesday the bear mission aims to help secure people's daily lives, but that Self Defense Force service members' primary mission is national defense and they cannot provide unlimited support for the bear response. The Japanese SDF is already understaffed.",
      "So far, the ministry has not received other requests for troop assistance over the bear issue, he said.",
      "In Akita prefecture, which has a population of about 880,000, bears have attacked more than 50 people since May, killing at least four, according to the local government. Experts say 70\uff05 of the bear attacks have occurred in residential areas.",
      "An elderly woman who went mushroom-hunting in the forest was found dead in an apparent bear attack over the weekend in Yuzawa City in the prefecture. Another elderly woman in Akita city encountered a bear while working on a farm and was killed in late October. And a newspaper delivery man was attacked by a bear and suffered an injury in Akita city on Tuesday.",
      "Experts say Japan's aging and declining population in rural areas are among the reasons for the growing bear problem in recent years.",
      "Abandoned neighborhoods and farmland with persimmon or chestnut trees often attract bears to residential areas. Once bears find food and acquire a taste, they keep coming back, experts say.",
      "Local hunters are also aging and not used to bear hunting. Experts say police and other authorities should be trained as \"government hunters\" to help cull the animals.",
      "The government set up a taskforce last week to create an official bear response by mid-November. Officials are considering bear population surveys, the use of communication devices to issue bear warnings and revisions to hunting rules. They also say experts should be trained in hunting and ecology.",
      "The lack of preventive measures in the depopulated and aging northern regions have also led to an increase in the populations of brown bears and Asiatic black bears, the ministry said.",

    "story": [
      "Shejaiya, Gaza Strip \u2014 The Israeli military brought our CBS News team for a rare look deep inside the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, to the Shejaiya neighborhood in the Palestinian territory's former de-facto capital, Gaza City.",
      "Shejaiya saw extremely fierce fighting before the U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas brought a fragile ceasefire to Gaza. The neighborhood is now a scene of utter destruction.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces says the bodies of several deceased hostages \u2014 21 of whom have now been returned from Gaza \u2014 were found amid the rubble in Shejaiya, including Israeli American IDF soldier Itay Chen, whose remains were\u00a0brought back to Israel on Tuesday night.",
      "The IDF brought CBS News to a location within a few hundred yards of the \"yellow line,\" the new boundary to which its forces have withdrawn under the ceasefire. The military has not allowed CBS News or other foreign outlets to report independently inside Gaza since the war began, though it has offered a few previous IDF-organized and guided media tours.",
      "The line cuts the Gaza Strip roughly in half, with the IDF in control of the eastern portion of the coastal territory, along its border. Most of Gaza's roughly 2 million residents have been pushed inside the yellow line, where they're living in the rubble and destruction left behind by two harrowing years of war.",
      "Hamas has attempted to reassert its authority inside the yellow line,\u00a0rounding up rivals and executing some it accuses of collaborating with Israel.",
      "But despite serious challenges and regular accusations by both sides that the other is violating the deal, the ceasefire has held for nearly a month.",
      "More trucks carrying humanitarian aid are getting into Gaza, delivering much needed food and fuel.",
      "But the process of returning the bodies of hostages to Israel has been much slower than was hoped, with seven of the deceased captives still in Gaza.",
      "Sporadic deadly violence has also tested the peace deal, with Israel accusing Hamas of killing its soldiers and then responding with lethal strikes.",
      "The big question now is what happens next.",
      "The United Nations\u00a0has estimated that it will cost $70 billion to rebuild the Gaza Strip, and it's not yet clear where that money will come from.",
      "President Trump's 20-point peace plan refers to a development plan to be created by a panel of experts, but it is light on details. The plan also calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, but many are skeptical that Hamas will ever completely give up its weapons, at least willingly.",
      "If that doesn't happen, Israel may be reluctant to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip, as envisioned by Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "If the plan doesn't stay on track, the fear is that the people of Gaza could be left in limbo, with very little hope of rebuilding their lives \u2014 and possibly with far less of the Gaza Strip's land left to do it in.",

    "summary": "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum says the harassment she suffered from a drunk man near the government seat is an assault on all women.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that the harassment she suffered from a drunk man in the street near Mexico's seat of government was an assault on all women, and that's why she decided to press charges against him.",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man was arrested.",
      "In a video circulating widely on social platforms, the man appeared to lean in for a kiss and touch the president's body with his hands on Tuesday. She gently pushed his hands away, maintaining a stiff smile as she turned to face him. She could be heard saying, in part, \"Don't worry.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Sheinbaum was firm in emphasizing that this was not the first time she had suffered such harassment and that the problem went far beyond her.",
      "\"No man has the right to violate that space,\" she said\u00a0in a video the Mexican government shared on social media when it announced charges had been filed.",
      "\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" Sheinbaum continued, adding that she also experienced it earlier in her life, as a student.",
      "\"My reflection is that if I do not report the crime, what condition does that leave Mexican women in?\" she said.",
      "The incident also raised questions about the president's security. Sheinbaum explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to save time. She said they could walk it in five minutes, rather than taking a 20-minute car ride. She said she would not change how she acts.",
      "Speaking out in solidarity with the president, Brugada used some of Sheinbaum's own language about being elected Mexico's first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman \u2014 in this case, Mexico's most powerful \u2014 is an assault on all women. When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn't just her coming to power, it was all women.",
      "\"If they touch the president, they touch all of us,\" Brugada wrote in\u00a0a statement released Wednesday. Her statement went on to note that Sheinbaum's references to the collective \"arrival\" of women to power in Mexico is \"not a slogan, it's a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.\"",
      "Mexico's National Governors Conference also voiced its support for the president as news broke that she would bring charges against the man.",
      "\"From CONAGO we condemn any aggression against women, in this case the aggression toward the president of Mexico,\" the group said in a statement shared on social media. \"Every form of violence against a woman is unacceptable and should have no place in a society that aspires to live with respect and equality.\"",

      "Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who will be the city's first Muslim mayor, and his victory left some people in Africa beaming with pride for a hometown son. Mamdani was born in the East African nation of Uganda 34 years ago, then lived in South Africa for two years before moving with his family to New York as a child.",
      "\"What a moment! It was beautiful! I am excited!\" cheered Joseph Beyanga, CEO of Uganda's National Association of Broadcasters, pumping his hands in the air as he spoke with CBS News.",
      "Beyanga said he was Mamdani's mentor when the now-mayor-elect interned at one of Uganda's top newspapers, the Daily Monitor, during a vacation when he was in high school.",
      "\"Whatever he wanted to do, there was no middle point. Always he wanted the top,\" recalled Beyanga. \"Then I realized he was not just interested in current affairs. He was interested in how the current affairs affect the people. If you're talking about big money, the budget and all that, how does this affect the last person \u2026 he was interested in how it affects the people.\"",
      "\"When it was time to interact with people, he talked to people looking straight in the eye,\" he said.",
      "Beyanga added that even 17 years after he met Mamdani, he still sees the same person in the New York City politician.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. His heart is with the people, and I don't think that will change,\" he said. \"I've seen other outlets calling him populist and opponents giving him all sorts of names. I see a man after the heart of serving people, serving the down-trodden people in society. And hey, that doesn't come far away from who he is. He is a Ugandan boy, and the Ugandan boy cares for the people.\"",
      "Beyanga compared excitement in Uganda now to the exuberance among many Kenyans and Indonesians when former President Barack Obama was first elected.",
      "\"The Ugandans are having their Mamdani moment,\" Beyanga told CBS News, \"and yes, we say if he did it, yes we can!\"",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Mayor Sadiq Khan \u2014 who became the British capital's first Muslim leader when he was first elected in 2016 \u2014 voiced solidarity with his new counterpart. Khan is currently serving his third consecutive term.",
      "\"New Yorkers faced a clear choice \u2014 between hope and fear \u2014 and just like we've seen in London \u2014 hope won,\" Khan said in a social media post. \"Huge congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on his historic campaign.\"",
      "Following Mamdani's election win, Time magazine published an article by Khan, who called it \"extraordinary\" that two of the world's most influential cities will be led by people of the same faith.",
      "\"But \u2014 in two of the most diverse cities on Earth \u2014 it's a bit beside the point,\" Khan said. \"We did not win because of our faith. We won because we addressed voters' concerns, rather than playing on them.\"",
      "\"Mayor Mamdani and I might not agree on everything. Many of the challenges our cities face are similar, but they are not identical. Put policy differences aside, though, and it's clear that we are united by something far more fundamental: our belief in the power of politics to change people's lives for the better.\"",
      "Mamdani, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has been accused of antisemitism and being pro-Hamas, which he denies.",
      "He has also been called out for refusing to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Intifada is an Arabic word that means uprising, but which is widely viewed as a slogan inciting violence against Israel. However, during his campaign he said he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase and that it \"is not language that I use.\"",
      "\"Mamdani's inflammatory remarks will not deter us,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Dannon said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"The Jewish community in New York and across the United States deserves safety and respect. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Jewish community leaders to ensure their security and well-being.\"",
      "CBS News' team in Israel said domestic media reports and editorials covering Mamdani's win were largely split along ideological lines. Left-wing commentary generally called for Mamdani to be given a chance, while more right-wing outlets leaned the other way.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Times of Israel's front-page headline read: \"Far-left, anti-Israel candidate Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race.\"",
      "The Jerusalem Post's top featured editorial said: \"Mamdani winning in NY means antisemitism can win elections, would impact Jews globally.\"",

      "The court also determined that the offenses carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years, normally an option in such cases.",
      "The man, who has not been publicly named, was accused by prosecutors of playing \"master of life and death\" over those in his care. His defense had demanded an acquittal at the trial which began in March.",

      "The U.S. Embassy criticized the escape as \"utterly unacceptable\" and called on the Guatemalan government to \"act immediately and vigorously to recapture these terrorists.\"",

      "Last week, the Guatemalan Attorney General's Office requested that President Arevalo's immunity be lifted in order to investigate him for \"breach of duty\" in connection with the escape.",
      "Barrio 18 is one of the largest gangs in the Northern Hemisphere, the U.S. State Department said in a\u00a0September news release, adding that the terror designation \"further demonstrates the Trump Administration's unwavering commitment to dismantling cartels and gangs and ensuring the safety of the American people.\"",
      "More than a dozen groups\u00a0have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term. In February, Mr. Trump declared eight drug cartels as terrorist groups, including the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",

      "Patterson's lawyer also accused the prosecution of an \"unfair and oppressive\" cross-examination during the trial.",
      "And her lawyer said evidence submitted and accepted by the judge wasn't relevant to her case while other evidence wasn't admitted but should have been.",
      "She also requested that she not be physically present in court should an oral hearing into her case go ahead.",
      "Patterson was sentenced in September and a judge said she would be eligible for parole after 33 years.",
      "The prosecution has since appealed what it called a \"manifestly inadequate\" sentence.",
      "Throughout a trial lasting more than two months, Patterson maintained the beef-and-pastry dish she served was accidentally poisoned with death cap mushrooms \u2014 the world's most lethal fungus.",
      "But a 12-person jury found Patterson guilty in July of murdering her husband Simon's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, as well as his aunt Heather Wilkinson, at her home in Leongatha, in the state of Victoria.",

      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",

    "story": [
      "The remains of a hostage in Gaza have been turned over and are now in Israel, the Israeli military said Tuesday, in the latest sign of progress under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces later confirmed the remains belonged to Itay Chen, the last Israeli American hostage held in Gaza. Chen died during battle at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza. He was 19 years old, the IDF said.",
      "Chen is survived by his parents and two brothers.",
      "With the IDF's confirmation, Hamas has returned the remains of 21 hostages to Israel under the ceasefire that began Oct. 10. The remains of seven others are still in Gaza. The\u00a0process of returning the bodies\u00a0of the last remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, has progressed slowly, with Hamas releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has\u00a0not been able to reach all of the remains\u00a0because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, the military wing of Hamas said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in Gaza and intended to hand over the remains. Israel's statement did not indicate whether the remains were of a soldier.",
      "Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and, in certain cases, has said the remains were not those of hostages. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, threatening to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. So far, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed over under the current ceasefire. Fewer than half have been identified. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza. The Hamas-run Health Ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.",
      "The war was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.",
      "Israel responded with a sweeping military offensive that has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health there, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.",
      "Israel, which has denied accusations by a United Nations commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll.",
      "The deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas was winding down due to the ceasefire, but\u00a0attacks briefly resumed last month\u00a0after Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire.",
      "The IDF said last week that it would \"continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it.\"",

      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests.",

      "Hundreds of tourism and travel industry groups are warning those planning to fly this Thanksgiving holiday that if the government shutdown doesn't end before the holiday arrives, passengers could face higher costs and increased wait times, delays and cancellations that could derail family travel plans across the country.",
      "The groups, collectively under the banner of the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group representing the U.S. travel industry, also warned in a letter to leaders in Congress of long-term economic harm to American workers, businesses and the economy amid the Thanksgiving holiday if the current government shutdown does not come to an end soon. The trade group estimates America's travel economy has already lost $4 billion due to the shutdown.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.S. Travel Association sent a letter to Senate leaders John Thune and Chuck Schumer and their counterparts in the House, Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries, urging the leaders to come to an agreement and pass \"a clean continuing resolution\" that will reopen the government after weeks of a shutdown that has been the longest in history.",

      "The letter warned that the longer the government is shut down, the more money the travel economy will lose, leading to negative downstream economic effects. Additionally, the letter, signed by nearly 500 travel and tourism industry organizations, warned that the longer the shutdown remains, the more strain airports will face from staffing shortages, which, if exacerbated further, could lead to major \"chaos\" as families try to fly for the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\"Last year, during Thanksgiving week, over 20 million passengers took flights in the United States,\" the letter to congressional leaders states. \"Thanksgiving is not only a time of national tradition and family connection, but also one of the most economically important travel weeks of the year.",
      "\"Travel spending during the holiday generates billions of dollars in economic activity, supporting jobs, local tax bases, and small businesses nationwide. A continued shutdown is likely to significantly suppress travel demand and spending, creating a real threat to American workers, businesses, and the overall economy.",

      "\"The American people expect and deserve a fully functioning federal government during the peak holiday travel season,\" the letter continued. \"Congress must act without delay to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government immediately and ensure full federal operations are restored in advance of the Thanksgiving travel period. The cost of continued inaction will be felt by families, workers, businesses, and communities in every part of the country.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced this week that his agency would order a 10% cut in flights across 40 major U.S. airports, citing air traffic controller shortages and safety concerns, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "In response to the directive, U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman said while the decision showed that safety is the No. 1 priority for the travel industry, it will nonetheless \"inevitably affect the travel experience, leading to fewer flights, longer delays and more disruptions for travelers.\"",

The fault for this situation rests squarely at the feet of Congress.\""

      "The civil rights complaint letters to the Justice Department follow the agency's decision to launch an investigation into the city of Austin for similar DEI violations, which was followed by AFL's first complaint letter to the Justice Department's Office of Civil Rights earlier this month, asking the agency to investigate Seattle over its allegedly discriminatory DEI practices. AFL filed a complaint against Portland a few days later as well, alleging similar accusations.",

      "\"Despite these federal civil rights laws, these jurisdictions openly engage in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"DEI\") policies in their respective jurisdictions, ordering local departments to implement discriminatory \u2018equity\u2019 programs and directives,\" an AFL press release states. \"Race-based policies do not create justice\u2014they destroy it. As Virginia lurches to the Left, America First Legal will continue leading the fight to ensure that federal funds never support programs that divide citizens, weaken public safety, or erode the rule of law.\"",
      "In AFL's complaint, the legal watchdog accuses the City of Richmond of creating a \"government-wide pattern or practice of discrimination\" by embedding racial equity in every department. The complaint cites hiring materials embedded with discriminatory themes, mandatory DEI training, Richmond's Equity Agenda, and the capital city's establishment of an Office of Equity and Inclusion, which AFL claims to have an aim to empower \"only certain people and communities wholly based on race,\" rather than merit.",
      "Richmond\u2019s fiscal year budgets reportedly measured department performance by the percentage of employees completing \"equity training,\" with a stated goal of 100% participation. Meanwhile, AFL also cited Richmond's \"Climate Equity Action Plan\" and \"Racial Equity and Environmental Justice (REEJ) program,\" which the group accuses of funneling resources to only certain racial groups.",

      "Alexandria's Office of Race and Social Equity (RASE), AFL alleges, serves to embed \"racial and social equity into all city policies, programs, decisions, and environments\" and ensure city policies and programs \"are discussed and evaluated through a racial and social justice lens.\"",
      "In particular, AFL calls out Alexandria's Police Department's development of a \"Racial Equity Plan,\" which the complaint claims has instructions for the police department \"to make efforts in creating a diverse workforce\" with the goal of \"improv[ing] the demographic representation\" through recruitment. A similar \"strategic plan\" from the city's fire department reportedly pushes similar hiring preferences on its department as well, AFL alleges.",

      "Arlington, meanwhile, is accused of establishing an \"Affirmative Action Plan,\" which AFL says includes \"underutilization goals\" based on race for specific job groups. These goals include increasing minority representation in the \"Senior Administrators\" job group from 35.23% to 45%, and minority representation in \"Police Officers\" from 27.38% to 38%, according to AFL's complaint.",

      "Last month, AFL reached a settlement with the City of Philadelphia that began in 2019 over alleged race- and sex-based quotas and \"discriminatory\" union-membership requirements in public contracting. Under the settlement, the City of Philadelphia agreed to rewrite its \"Project Labor Agreements,\" which AFL said penalized city contractors that refused to abide by its DEI mandates. Under the settlement, the city was compelled to make previous workforce diversity goals \"strictly aspirational\" and end \"quotas or mandatory minimums.\""

It\u2019s a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win,\" Obama posted to X Tuesday as the elections were called and handed Democrats wins in the handful of high-profile elections. \"We\u2019ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter.\"",

      "The Democrat added that economic and affordability concerns weighed heavily on voters heading to the ballot boxes just a year after electing Trump in an election that also largely focused on the economy and inflation woes from the Biden-era.",
      "\"What that should tell Trump is that there's too much noise and too much distraction, and that he needs to focus on getting the economy into overdrive.\u00a0This means concluding the trade agreements ASAP, reducing the tariffs, and allowing the economy to soar after the tax cuts in deregulation,\"\u00a0he said.",

      "The Virginia and New Jersey campaigns both focused on deriding the Trump administration as taking the U.S. down the wrong path, including both candidates vowing to ease affordability and housing crisis woes on the state level while battling White House policies as they relate to their states. Obama also took part in slamming the Trump administration while making his pitch to voters.",

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead.

      "Losing your life savings to fraud is not a distant fear; it is a real and growing risk. Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data. These criminals no longer rely on basic phone tricks. Instead, they use caller ID spoofing and artificial-voice software to sound like trusted professionals, often imitating real bank employees down to the smallest detail.",

      "HOW SCAMMERS EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FOR 'PRE-APPROVED' RETIREMENT SCAMS",
      "What impostor bank scams look like",
      "Scammers pretending to be from your bank follow a predictable yet terrifying pattern. They begin with an urgent phone call warning that your account has been compromised. The caller ID displays your bank's real number, which builds instant trust.",
      "Impostor scams have become one of the fastest-growing crimes in America, costing victims billions each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, they instruct you to move your money into a so-called \"safe\" or \"decoy\" account while they \"investigate\" the issue. Their goal is to create fear and push you into action before you have time to think.",
      "One journalist reportedly learned this lesson the hard way when he answered what appeared to be a legitimate call from Chase Bank. After a series of convincing conversations with multiple \"representatives,\" he transferred nearly $30,000 to scammers. In another case, a 65-year-old caterer reportedly lost $162,000 when a friendly woman pretending to be a bank employee claimed her ATM card had been compromised. These stories are not rare; they reflect how sophisticated and believable modern scams have become.",
      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",
      "Older adults are particularly vulnerable. The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024. These numbers highlight how no one is immune to manipulation when fear and urgency collide.",

      "Spoofed numbers make a call appear as if it's coming from your bank, even when it's not.",
      "Do not return calls using numbers given to you by the person who contacted you. Always call the number printed on your debit or credit card.",
      "Scammers often collect phone numbers, email addresses and other personal details from public records and data broker sites. Using a trusted data removal service helps wipe that information from the web, reducing the chances that criminals can use your data to impersonate you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Keeping your software updated adds another layer of protection against evolving scams.",

But you can fight back with knowledge and caution. Stay alert every time your phone rings or your inbox pings. Slow down before you react. Verify before you trust. The few seconds you take to double-check could be what saves your life savings. Remember, even the most tech-savvy people fall for scams when emotions take over. The real key to protection isn't fear, it's awareness and action. Share what you know with friends, family and coworkers.

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new scam called ghost tapping is spreading across the country. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns that scammers are using this tactic to steal money from people who use tap-to-pay credit cards and mobile wallets.",
      "This scam exploits wireless technology to withdraw money without your awareness. Many victims only realize something is wrong after small, unnoticed transactions slowly drain their accounts.",

      "The Better Business Bureau warns of a new \"ghost-tapping\" scam draining money from tap-to-pay cards and mobile wallets. (Clara Margais/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",
      "Real-life cases and warnings",
      "A Missouri resident reportedly lost $100 after being approached by a person carrying a handheld card reader. The BBB Scam Tracker has recorded many similar cases across the nation, with losses sometimes exceeding $1,000.",
      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "The BBB says reports of \"ghost tapping\" are rising, with some victims losing more than $1,000 to contactless theft. (M. Scott Brauer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",
      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",
      "In addition to keeping your apps updated, protect your device from hidden threats with strong antivirus software. It scans for malicious apps and spyware that can hijack your tap-to-pay data or record sensitive information.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "While convenient, storing several cards in one app can increase your exposure if your phone is compromised. Keep only the cards you use most often connected to your mobile wallet. This reduces the impact of potential fraudulent activity.",
      "If you ever suspect ghost tapping or notice a strange charge, contact your bank immediately and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Quick action can help prevent additional losses and assist authorities in identifying scam trends.",
      "Victims of \"ghost tapping\" often lose money through small, unnoticed transactions before realizing they\u2019ve been scammed. (Leonie Asendorpf/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As contactless payments become more common, scammers are getting more creative. Staying informed and cautious can help protect your money. Small steps like checking your transaction history and using protective gear can make a big difference. If you notice unauthorized charges, contact your bank immediately, freeze your card and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Technology offers convenience but can also create new risks. The ghost-tapping scam shows how quickly and easily payments can invite hidden dangers. Awareness and prevention remain the best ways to keep your finances safe.",

      "Why smart TVs have microphones at all",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:30:15 -0500",
    "summary": "SessionReaper vulnerability hits Magento and Adobe Commerce stores, compromising 250+ sites in one day. Hackers steal data and hijack shopping sessions.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "From password managers to antivirus software, experts share practical ways to keep hackers out of your data. (Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "A growing number of companies specialize in removing your personal data from online databases and people search sites. These platforms often collect and publish names, addresses, phone numbers and even family details without consent, creating easy targets for scammers and identity thieves.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Protecting your identity starts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and regular software updates. (Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",

      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",

As space becomes more reachable, the idea of data centers floating above Earth feels less like fiction and more like something that could actually happen. Each of these missions could teach us a little more about how to build a sustainable digital future.",

      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",
      "Peter reveals that when they were all playing, he stuck his foot out to trip Brian. It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

      "\u201cIf you follow the order from your national director, you are dumb,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century, and I\u2019m not a doll to get makeup put on and get my hair done for and have my clothes changed.

    "story": [
      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility. All\u2019s Fair forgets that balance \u2014 and the result is a show that feels out of touch with the moment we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

    "summary": "Former \"Dancing with the Stars\" host Tom Bergeron will return to the show as a guest judge.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Bergeron is putting his dancing shoes back on.",
      "The former host of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d will return to the hit ABC series, now in Season 34, for its Nov. 11 episode. He\u2019ll appear as a guest judge to help celebrate the show's 20th anniversary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anticipating that it\u2019s going to be a wonderfully emotional, nostalgic night,\u201d Bergeron told TV Insider.",
      "\u201cIn the audience will be a number of past champions and competitors,\" he added. \"There\u2019s a special dance challenge that is going to factor into the anniversary night that will evoke even more nostalgia. It\u2019s going to be great. And I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s so much fun to watch my friends do the work. I don\u2019t have to throw to commercials. I don\u2019t have to worry about the timing.\u201d",
      "Bergeron also said he will happily play second fiddle to current co-host Alfonso Ribeiro, who competed on the show in 2014 before becoming a host in 2022. Julianne Hough joined as his co-host in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be respectful and sensitive of what Alfonso has to deal with, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just looking forward to being in an environment surrounded by people I really care about on live television, where there\u2019s no second take. It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d",
      "As for what viewers can expect to see from Bergeron at the judges' table?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very similar to my hosting style: somewhat loose and unpredictable,\u201d he said.",
      "Why Did Tom Bergeron Leave 'Dancing with the Stars'?",
      "Bergeron was the original co-host of \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d when it premiered in 2005. He remained in the role, winning one Emmy for his work on the show, until he left the series in 2020 after he objected to the casting of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",
      "Bergeron, who was replaced at the time by Tyra Banks, said he had previously been assured no political figures would compete on the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Guys, this is exactly what we said we wouldn\u2019t do,\u2019\u201d Bergeron said of his reaction to the casting during a 2023 appearance on dancer Cheryl Burke's \u201cSex, Lies, and Spray Tans\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cAnd I would have responded the same way if they had booked Hillary Clinton, whom I voted for. \u2018Don\u2019t go there. This is, you know, not the right time. Play to our strengths. Be the show that gives people a break from all this bulls---.\u2019 So, I was furious,\u201d he added.",
      "After Spicer was cast in 2019, Bergeron posted his disapproval in a since-deleted post on Twitter, now X.",
      "\u201cA few months ago, during a lunch with DWTS\u2019 new Executive Producer, I offered suggestions for Season 28,\u201d Bergeron wrote. \u201cChief among them was my hope that DWTS, in its return following an unprecedented year-long hiatus, would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations. I left that lunch convinced we were in agreement.\u201d",
      "He said the casting decision was not his to make.",
      "\u201cIt is the prerogative of the producers, in partnership with the network, to make whatever decisions they feel are in the best long term interests of the franchise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it\u2019s their call. I\u2019ll leave it to them to answer any further questions about those decisions.\u201d"

      "In a Nov. 4 Instagram post, Bunnie Xo shared her seven mugshots and reflected on her journey so far.",
      "\u201cLooking at the first one, I just couldn\u2019t believe what a baby I was. I was 19 , already living on the streets of Vegas for 5 years, couch to couch, or with whatever boyfriend would let me stay. By then I\u2019d already lost three babies,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cAs the pics go on the eyes only get more sad, more broken & more intoxicated.\u201d",

She thought surviving meant hyper independence, fighting in the streets, barking loud & biting even harder.\u201d",
      "Bunnie said her last mugshot was taken when she was 26 years old. She said she was arrested for soliciting an undercover cop at a casino.",
      "\u201cI can still see the drugs in my skin, the bloodshot eyes, the hollow look that comes when you\u2019ve stopped caring if you wake up tomorrow. I was deep in addiction, lost in survival mode. Add in a splash of perpetual victim mentality & it was a recipe for disaster,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The podcaster, who is married to country musician Jelly Roll, said she eventually decided that she wanted a different life for herself.",
      "\u201cI got sick. Sick of humiliating myself, sick of always having to start over & sick of who I was as a human. I had to stop pointing fingers & realize, two things can be true: I was the problem & the solution,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Bunnie said she relied on her faith and can now see that these experiences helped shape the person she is today.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of these photos. They remind me who I used to be, & how far grace has carried me,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Bunnie acknowledged that she\u2019s still \u201clearning\u201d and \u201chealing\u201d and shared a motivational message with her followers.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in your own rock-bottom season right now, I need you to know this- you can rebuild. You CAN rewrite your story & start believing in yourself. You are never too far gone for God to find you, love you, & lift you out,\u201d she wrote.",
      "After reading his wife\u2019s vulnerable post, Jelly Roll shared a message of support in the comments.",
      "\u201cI would have never became the man I am with out you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was your story that inspired mine, it was always you I was trying to be like. Im glad the world is about to hear the real perseverance , and see what God can really do. While people talked about us, judged us, wished on our downfall, we just stayed the course and believed what God had for us no man could take away. We overcome by the blood of the lamb and the power of out testimony. TESTIFY BABY! TESTIFY!\u201d"

      "On Nov. 1, the singer released a video on her Instagram page to unofficially declare that the holiday season had begun. It's become a tradition for the star in recent years, much to the delight of many Christmas lovers who are equally as eager to start celebrating.",
      "However, this year's video doubles as an ad for a major beauty retailer, and its message is rubbing some consumers the wrong way.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the controversy.",

      "In 2020, the singer played into the annual hype by beginning a new \"It's Time\" tradition.",

      "The 2022 video showed Carey dressed as a witch while she rode a bicycle. Soon, she was in a Santa jumpsuit on top of a reindeer.",
      "What Happens in the 2025 Version?",
      "Carey\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d videos aren\u2019t typically advertisements, but this year\u2019s installment is an ad for Sephora.",

      "\"Halloween slayed but now it's ti..... ,\" she says as she begins to sing in her signature high-pitch.",

      "\u201cSpill the tea. Who\u2019s the thief?\u201d she says.",
      "Comedian Billy Eichner, dressed as an elf, walks away and says, \u201cBusted! Bad news, Mariah Carey, the elves are striking this year. Elf revenge for putting us through holiday hell. Santa's helper quit. I'm pawning all this so I can afford elf therapy.\"",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my blush, elf boy,\u201d Carey quips.",

      "\"Any last worlds?\" Eichner says.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Carey says. \"It's time!\"",
      "As she sings, Eichner freezes and transforms into a snowman. Carey then appears dressed in a Santa-inspired ensemble, driving a sleigh. As she makes her way around the world, she drops a Sephora bag into one chimney.",
      "Carey captioned the video with the hashtag #SephoraPartner and the words \"It\u2019s Time!!!\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81.\"",
      "Why Is This Year\u2019s Video Receiving Backlash?",

      "Another called it \u201cso iconic.\u201d",
      "Others were more critical of the ad's premise and execution, especially given the context it's landing in.",
      "TikTok user @njml5 felt it mocked consumers who were planning to sit out Black Friday and Christmas shopping this year.",
      "\"The commercial is corny, period. But they are definitely mocking the people, working class people, who have decided, 'You know what? I'm not fueling this economy. I'm not spending all this money on Black Friday. I'm not spending all this money on Christmas fueling the economy when the economy is not fueling us,'\" she said in a video.",
      "TikTok user @millennial.mia also critiqued the ad in a post of her own, saying it was \"one of the most tone deaf advertisements we have seen in this entire year.\"",
      "\"At a time right now where 42 million Americans aren't able to put food on the table. People who are working for the federal government are not being paid. You want to post about Mariah saving Christmas? Well, how about Mariah, actually do something about, oh I don't know, saving Christmas? Or how about you, Sephora, why don't you step in and do something charitable instead of profitable for a change?\" she said.",
      "TikTok user @nathanramospark pointed out that \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is, at its core, an \"anti-capitalism song\" since it talks how gifts don't matter. The song goes, \"All I want for Christmas is you,\" after all.",
      "\"But then you have a company use this song to somehow, because it has an emotional connection, they strip it of its meaning so that they can sell literal makeup,\" he said.",
      "The social media user also encouraged other Americans to tune in to what the song is supposed to mean.",
      "\"Just go back to the original meaning of the song. The original intent, that is what Christmas is about. Christmas is about sharing love and tidings of good cheer,\" he said.",
      "Others were turned off by one major element of the video: a worker who wants to go on strike but is unable to do so.",
      "\u201cSo the message here is \u2018working class on strike for being overworked and underpaid gets turned into snowman and is forced to work anyway\u2019?\u201d one Instagram user commented.",
      "It's worth noting that this isn\u2019t the first time Carey and Eichner have teamed up to spread holiday cheer. In 2020, the comedian was one of several stars to appear in Carey\u2019s Apple TV special, \u201cMariah Carey\u2019s Magical Christmas Special.",
      "In a trailer for the special, Eichner is dressed up as an elf, wearing an outfit similar to \u2014 but not exactly like \u2014 the one he wears in the 2025 \"It's Time\" video."

      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "In a televised meeting with his Security Council in Moscow, Putin said that he had warned the U.S. and others that if they \"conduct such tests, Russia would also be required to take appropriate retaliatory measures.\"",
      "He told the foreign and defense ministries \"to do everything possible to gather additional information on this matter, analyze it in the Security Council, and submit coordinated proposals on the possible commencement of preparations for nuclear weapons testing.\u201d",
      "Several of Putin's top officials backed the need for resumed tests.",
      "\u201cWe must respond appropriately to Washington\u2019s actions,\u201d Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said, urging his government \u201cto begin preparations for full-scale nuclear testing immediately.\u201d",
      "Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia's chief of the general staff, added, \"If we do not take appropriate measures now, we will miss the opportunity to respond promptly to the United States' actions, since preparation for nuclear tests, depending on their type, takes several months to several years.\"",
      "Russian Ambassador in Washington Alexander Darchiev had sent a telegram to U.S. officials \"to clarify these controversial statements by U.S. President Donald Trump,\" Sergey Naryshkin, chief of Russia's foreign intelligence service, told the council.",
      "But \"representatives from both the White House and the U.S. State Department declined to comment,\" he added, \"stating that they would report the information to their superiors and contact the Russian side if it will be deemed necessary to provide clarification.\"",
      "The Security Council meeting was supposed to focus on transport security. However, Speaker of the Russian State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin asked members to first comment on Washington's announcement of renewed nuclear tests.",
      "NBC News has contacted the Pentagon and State Department for comment.",
      "The move comes after Trump announced last week that he had instructed the Defense Department to \u201cimmediately\u201d start testing nuclear weapons \u201con an equal basis\u201d with other nations.",
      "The U.S. has not conducted a nuclear test since 1992, China and France last did so in 1996 and the Soviet Union in 1990.",
      "Trump's order was widely criticized by nuclear scientists and nonproliferation experts, who said that Washington had little to gain from live drills, which would likely only embolden Moscow and Beijing.",
      "The U.S. has only one viable testing location, the former Nevada Nuclear Test Site near Las Vegas, which would take at least two years to get up and running, experts said.",
      "There has been little clarity from Trump and his team.",
      "Asked whether he planned to resume actual explosive nuclear tests underground, the president told reporters Friday, \"You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing, yeah.\"",
      "He added: \"Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\"",
      "On Sunday, his energy secretary, Chris Wright, told Fox News that \"these will be nonnuclear explosions\" that would develop \"sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.\u201d",
      "Given the seemingly conflicting public statements from officials in Washington, Russia was \"not entirely clear about the United States\u2019 future actions and steps regarding the conduct or nonconduct of nuclear weapons tests,\" Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told the meeting.",
      "For his part, Putin has often rattled the nuclear saber since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He has warned Western nations not to intervene in the conflict, suggesting he would not be afraid to use Moscow's arsenals were they to do so.",
      "Last month, he said that Russia had conducted the first hourslong test of a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile capable of evading U.S. missile defenses. In response, Trump said he had a nuclear submarine \u201cright off their shores.\u201d",
      "According to the Norwegian government, the missile, the the Burevestnik, was launched from Novaya Zemlya, an archipelago off the northern coast of Russia. Belousov referred to this site again on Wednesday.",

      "Street battles were being fought in Pokrovsk, a transport and supply hub whose capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger nearby cities.

      "Putin's forces have been battling to take Pokrovsk for more than a year, but now appear on the verge of a breakthrough with the front lines in the city increasingly blurred.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian troops should surrender to save themselves, claiming they were \"trapped\" by Russian forces in the city, which was once home to some 60,000 people but is now largely deserted and destroyed.",
      "It said that Russian troops were advancing further northward into Pokrovsk, blocking multiple Ukrainian attempts to break out of encirclement.",
      "Ukraine's military insisted Wednesday that there was \"no encirclement of our units and formations\" in Pokrovsk. Units defending the city had been reinforced, it said, as Russian forces tried to \"infiltrate and accumulate.\"",

      "However, Ukrainian military officials and soldiers on the ground have conceded that the situation in Pokrovsk is increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d Sgt. Liana Kononchuk of the Ukrainian unit operating in Pokrovsk, told NBC News via WhatsApp this week. \u201cWe are trying to control it. But, unfortunately, it has only been getting worse lately,\u201d the 31-year-old said.",
      "\u201cAs of now there is no permanent line of defense as such,\u201d she said. \u201cThe enemy seeps northwards by one, two, three units at a time, thereby trying to erode the frontline,\u201d Kononchuk added.",
      "Her comments match the assessment of the Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State. Its latest map showed that Russian forces had pushed further into the city from the south but that most of the area remained a contested gray zone controlled by neither side.",
      "Ukraine has deployed additional resources in a bid to hold back the Russian assault, including a special forces operation using U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters to restore supply routes, according to a spokesperson for the 7th Rapid Response Corps that is leading the defensive effort.",
      "Kononchuk hopes that these reinforcements will stabilize the situation. \u201cThe logistics situation is now very complicated. Rotating positions is hard, and evacuating the wounded is even harder,\u201d she said.",
      "The Ukrainian commander overseeing defense of the city, Col. Yevhen Lasiichuk, said via WhatsApp on Monday that Moscow\u2019s claims of an encirclement were false and part of Russia\u2019s propaganda \u201cgame.\u201d",
      "Lasiichuk said that there were between 200 and 300 Russian soldiers inside the city.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to push through the town to block key logistic points,\u201d he added.",
      "Lasiichuk stressed that, although complicated, Ukraine was still able to reach its troops in Pokrovsk.",
      "\u201cOur Defense Forces units have recently carried out airborne landings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly does not look like an encirclement.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that its troops had repelled a Ukrainian special forces landing and killed all 11 soldiers who arrived by helicopter.",
      "Influential Russian military bloggers have reported the heavy use of drones and smaller mobile units to disrupt Ukrainian defenses.",
      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",
      "Other experts said it could bolster Putin's bargaining hand after Trump called off a planned summit and imposed new sanctions on Russia last month.",
      "\"Moscow could also try to use any battlefield gains to pressure Ukraine at the negotiating table and persuade Trump to accept Russia\u2019s terms,\" Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an interview.",

      "A man with a knife also entered a barber shop in Fletton, an area in Peterborough, at around the same time Friday, police said. It was reported to the Cambridgeshire Constabulary two hours later, but the man had left the shop, so officers were not dispatched.",
      "On Saturday at 12:46 a.m., police received a report that a 17-year-old \"suffered facial injuries after being attacked with a knife\" on a Docklands Light Railway train at the Pontoon Dock station.",
      "\"The suspect had left the location before police arrival,\" police said. \"BTP subsequently identified Anthony Williams as a suspect and took steps to locate and arrest him that day.\"",
      "Hours later, at 9:25 a.m., barbers in Fletton reported \"a further incident\" to the Cambridgeshire Constabulary. Police arrived about 18 minutes later but could not find the suspect.",
      "At 7:42 p.m., police and medics rushed to a train station in Huntingdon, northwest of Cambridge, after reports of a stabbing on an LNER train. The train made an unscheduled stop as emergency services responded, according to police.",
      "A LNER staff member who tried to stop the suspect \u2014 later identified by police as Williams \u2014 was critically wounded. The staff member, who police hailed as a hero, \"remains stable but critically unwell,\" police said. Three other victims are in the hospital in stable condition.",
      "Following the attack, Superintendent John Loveless said there is \u201cnothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,\u201d noting that Williams was born in the United Kingdom and is from Peterborough.",
      "BTP detectives are now looking into all five incidents, police said, adding that \"active enquiries are being made.\"",
      "Williams has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of a bladed article over the attack on Saturday, according to police. He has also been charged with attempted murder in connection with the Pontoon Dock incident.",
      "\u201cThe criminal investigation is a priority for British Transport Police, and we are working closely with Cambridgeshire Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service,\" said Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy. \"We have also this week initiated measures to increase the visibility of police officers across the railway network to reassure both rail staff and the travelling public.\"",
      "Cundy asked anyone who sees \"something that doesn\u2019t feel right\" to contact the British Transport Police."

      "Then last year, Koza-Culp typed her great-grandmother\u2019s maiden name, Litvak, into an online database and discovered something she never could have imagined.",
      "Two of her great-grandmother\u2019s siblings had survived. One of those siblings had a son living in Israel \u2014 and he wanted to talk.",
      "Watch \"Hallie Jackson Now\" tonight at 5 p.m. ET/4 p.m. ET on NBC News NOW for the full segment",
      "\u201cWe spent so many years apart, so many years not knowing each other,\u201d Koza-Culp told NBC News. \u201cTo take that back, to get some of that joy and love back \u2026 the best revenge is living well, I guess, as they say.\u201d",
      "Koza-Culp\u2019s discovery was made possible by the Names Database at Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. And now, the very database that helped Koza-Culp find her family has reached an important milestone: Yad Vashem has recovered the names of 5 million of the estimated 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators.",
      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",
      "Yad Vashem\u2019s organized effort to restore Jewish victims\u2019 names began in the 1950s and has stretched across generations, powered by survivors, their descendents and researchers determined to ensure every victim is honored.",
      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from New York City, and Paul Goldman reported from Jerusalem."
