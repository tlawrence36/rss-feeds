      "Wink Martindale, the genial host of such hit game shows as \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cTic-Tac-Dough,\u201d has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Wink Martindale, the genial host of such hit game shows as \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cTic-Tac-Dough\u201d who also did one of the first recorded television interviews with a young Elvis Presley, has died. He was 91.",
      "Martindale died Tuesday at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, California, according to his publicist Brian Mayes. Martindale had been battling lymphoma for a year.",
      "\u201cHe was doing pretty well up until a couple weeks ago,\u201d Mayes said by phone from Nashville.",
      "\u201cGambit\u201d debuted on the same day in September 1972 as \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d with Bob Barker and \u201cThe Joker\u2019s Wild\u201d with Jack Barry.",
      "\u201cFrom the day it hit the air, \u2018Gambit\u2019 spelled winner, and it taught me a basic tenant of any truly successful game show: KISS! Keep It Simple Stupid,\u201d Martindale wrote in his 2000 memoir \u201cWinking at Life.\u201d \u201cLike playing Old Maids as a kid, everybody knows how to play 21, i.e. blackjack.\u201d",
      "\u201cGambit\u201d had been beating its competition on NBC and ABC for over two years. But a new show debuted in 1975 on NBC called \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d By December 1976, \u201cGambit\u201d was off the air and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d became an institution that is still going strong today.",
      "Martindale bounced back in 1978 with \u201cTic-Tac-Dough,\u201d the classic X\u2019s and O\u2019s game on CBS that ran until 1985.",
      "\u201cOvernight I had gone from the outhouse to the penthouse,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He presided over the 88-game winning streak of Navy Lt. Thom McKee, who earned over $300,000 in cash and prizes that included eight cars, three sailboats and 16 vacation trips. At the time, McKee\u2019s winnings were a record for a game show contestant.",
      "\u201cI love working with contestants, interacting with the audience and to a degree, watching lives change,\u201d Martindale wrote. \u201cWinning a lot of cash can cause that to happen.\u201d",
      "Martindale wrote that producer Dan Enright once told him that in the seven years he hosted \u201cTic-Tac-Dough\u201d he gave away over $7 million in cash and prizes.",
      "Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.",
      "Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was \u201cIs Wink your real name?\u201d The second was \u201cHow did you get into game shows?\u201d",
      "He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.",
      "Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.",
      "He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.",
      "After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson\u2019s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.",
      "Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record \u201cThat\u2019s All Right\u201d was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.",
      "Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale\u2019s TV show \u201cTop Ten Dance Party\u201d in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale\u2019s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of \u201cG.I. Blues\u201d in 1960.",
      "In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of \u201cDeck of Cards,\u201d which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could easily have thought, \u2019Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.\u201d",
      "A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry.",
      "His first network hosting job was on NBC\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s This Song?\u201d where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65.",
      "He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: \u201cDream Girl \u201967\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s Your Mother-in-Law?\u201d The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!\u201d Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.",
      "Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of \u201cGambit\u201d from 1980-81.",
      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, \u201cBumper Stumpers,\u201d ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990.",
      "He hosted \u201cDebt\u201d from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and \u201cInstant Recall\u201d on GSN in 2010.",
      "Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated \u201cThe 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.\u201d In 2021, he hosted syndicated program \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe.",
      "He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale's children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972.",

    "story": [
      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A Texas rapper has been convicted of murder for a second time after a jury found him guilty of fatally shooting a San Antonio man in 2017",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- A Texas rapper who performed as Tay-K and was best known for his 2017 single \u201cThe Race\u201d was convicted of murder for a second time after a jury found him guilty of fatally shooting a San Antonio man.",
      "Taymor McIntyre faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the killing of 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar in 2017. McIntyre had already been been serving a 55-year sentence over a separate fatal shooting.",
      "Prosecutors said that McIntyre shot Saldivar after the rapper tried to rob him. Authorities said McIntyre had picked up Saldivar, who was a photographer, in a car after asking him to take photos of the rapper for a new song.",
      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",

Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",

Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",

      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",

Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \u201ccommitted any sexual offense\u201d and that \u201cany sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\u201d",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",

      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "An estimated 35,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized each year when their liver suddenly fails. There are few treatment options and death rates as high as 50%. Many don't qualify for a liver transplant or can't get a match in time.",

      "In experiments with four deceased bodies, that \u201cbridge\u201d attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",

      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "A man has been arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters after threatening violence",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man was arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters in Minnesota after threatening violence, months after the company's CEO was killed, authorities said Monday.",
      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",
      "\u201cWhile the investigation is still in its early stages, there is currently no indication that the individual had specific grievances against UnitedHealthcare,\u201d Wittenborg said in a statement.",
      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione also faces federal charges, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this month she has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance",
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance.",
      "The easily preventable disease, declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, ripped through communities sprawling across more than 20 Texas counties in part because health departments were starved of the funding needed to run vaccine programs, officials say.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong immunization program that can really do a lot of boots-on-the-ground work for years,\u201d said Katherine Wells, the health director in Lubbock, a 90-minute drive from the outbreak's epicenter.",
      "Immunization programs nationwide have been left brittle by years of stagnant funding by federal, state and local governments. In Texas and elsewhere, this helped set the stage for the measles outbreak and fueled its spread. Now cuts to federal funding threaten efforts to prevent more cases and outbreaks.",
      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

      "Santoro said his son first met Karenna Groff as a freshman studying at MIT. Groff, who grew up in Weston, Massachusetts, was an All-American soccer player studying biomedical engineering. Santoro, a math major from New Jersey, played lacrosse for the school.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Karenna Groff co-founded openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. In 2023, she received the prestigious NCAA woman of the year award for the previous year for her on- and off-field accomplishments.",
      "\u201cReally, this recognition is a testament to my MIT women\u2019s soccer family and all of the guidance, support, and friendship they have provided for me over the years,\u201d she said in an interview at the time.",
      "After graduating, Santoro and Groff moved to Manhattan, where Groff enrolled in medical school at New York University and Santoro worked as an investment associate for Silver Point, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "India-born Saini was an accomplished pelvic surgeon and the founder of Boston Pelvic Health and Wellness, according to the family statement. She trained in medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, where she met Michael Groff, who became a distinguished neurosurgeon and experienced pilot, the statement said.",
      "On Saturday morning, they all headed to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, a suburb of New York City, where they boarded Michael Groff's private plane, according to John Santoro.",
      "They were set to land at Columbia County Airport but crashed roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the south. The plane was \u201ccompressed, buckled and embedded in the terrain\u201d of a muddy agricultural field, Inman said.",
      "The pilot was flying under instrument flight rules, rather than visual flight rules, but it was too soon to determine if reduced visibility from weather conditions were a factor, he said.",
      "The plane had been sold a year ago and had an upgraded cockpit with newer technology that was certified to Federal Aviation Administration standards, according to the NTSB.",
      "Investigators expect to be at the crash site for about a week and a full accident report could take between 12 and 24 months to complete, Inman said.",
      "Funeral arrangements were underway, Santoro said.",
      "\u201cThe 25 years we had with James were the best years of our lives,\u201d he added, \u201cand the joy and love he brought us will be enough to last a lifetime.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",
      "\u201cI made it very clear, we are not DEI \u2014 as tribal nations, as a political entity,\" he said.",

      "He was also quick to rebuke media who tried to interview him in English during the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which was held in France.",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",

      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses. Districts also relied on the aid for programs and services for homeless students, as well as tutoring for students who fell behind because of missed classroom time.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on our schools will hurt our most vulnerable students and make it harder for them to thrive,\u201d James said. \u201cCutting school systems\u2019 access to vital resources that our students and teachers rely on is outrageous and illegal.\u201d",

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place.

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor sending items to the US, the public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the U.S.\u2019s unreasonable and bullying acts,\u201d the government wrote.",

      "Hong Kong, is caught in the middle of the trade disputes between the U.S. and China despite being a free port.",

But Washington began treating it as part of China after Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, and has applied the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.",

      "Around 80 students who set off on bicycles 13 days ago on a journey to Strasbourg, France, were aiming to draw EU attention to their monthslong protests against corruption in the Balkan nation. Serbia is formally seeking membership in the 27-nation bloc but has been backsliding in democratic freedoms and the rule of law.",
      "They received an emotional welcome from hundreds of people, including members of the Serbian diaspora and French students and supporters upon arriving at the main square in Strasbourg where the European Parliament meets.",

      "Serbian university students have been a key force behind a nationwide anti-graft movement that includes almost daily street demonstrations that have rattled the Balkan nation\u2019s President Aleksandar Vucic. While they have garnered huge support at home and throughout the Balkans, many students feel they haven\u2019t received enough backing from the EU.",
      "The students cycled 100-150 kilometers (60-90 miles) per day through Hungary, Slovakia, Austria and Germany before reaching Strasbourg where they received a red carpet welcome from Serbs living abroad and fellow-students from the EU.",
      "They braved heavy rain and chilling temperatures along their journey across Europe that included a hero's welcome by supporters in Budapest, Vienna and in German towns.",
      "The student-led protests in Serbia were triggered by the deaths of 16 people in a deadly train station canopy collapse in November, widely blamed on rampant corruption. They have since come to reflect wider discontent with the state of democratic freedoms in Serbia.",
      "The protesting students have been demanding justice for the victims of the Nov. 1 canopy collapse and an end to government pressure and violence against protesters.",
      "Vucic and his pro-government media have accused the students and their professors of working against the state to topple him from power together with unidentified Western security services. He has not provided any evidence for his claims.",
      "The EU\u2019s reaction to the mostly peaceful student-led protests has been lukewarm and officials have refrained from criticizing Vucic. They apparently consider him a key factor in maintaining peace in a region that went through a series of devastating wars in the 1990s.",
      "In Strasbourg, the students plan to visit the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.",
      "Since coming to power over a decade ago, Vucic has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms while maintaining close links with Russia and China.",
      "In Serbia on Tuesday, student-led protesters temporarily blocked the entrances to Vucic's main propaganda TV broadcaster RTS in Belgrade and the northern town of novi sad to protest its coverage of the events.",

      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor, beginning in the 2030s.",
      "Experts say the huge challenge of decommissioning the plant is just beginning, and that the work could take more than a century.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Tens of thousands of people gathered at Judaism\u2019s holiest site in Jerusalem on Tuesday for the traditional priestly blessing prayer.",
      "The \u201cBirkat Cohanim,\u201d or Cohen\u2019s blessing, is a ritual dating back over 2,500 years to when King Solomon\u2019s Temple stood on the same site. The blessing is performed by male Jews who can trace their lineage back to the priestly caste, and takes place three times a year during Judaism\u2019s major holidays. Jews are currently observing the week-long holiday of Passover.",
      "The prayer was led by many of the country\u2019s top rabbis as well as Eliya Cohen, a former hostage who was released from Gaza in February, and relatives of other hostages still being held in Gaza. After the traditional blessing, the rabbis recited a prayer for the 59 hostages still held in captivity in Gaza.",
      "Many worshippers said the prayer had special meaning this year, given the ongoing war, which has stretched on for more than 18 months. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that we still have hostages that are not able to come home and come and be here and join us with this,\u201d said Shandey Fuchs, who said she tries to attend the ceremony every year. She added that she hopes the prayer brings unity and lasting peace across Israel.",
      "The blessing is recited in Hebrew while religious men cover their heads with prayer shawls, creating a sea of white at the Western Wall Plaza. The paved prayer area in front of the wall is the last remnant of the second Jewish Temple destroyed in the 1st century. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which runs the site, said more than 200,000 people have visited the site during the Passover holiday, one of three Jewish holidays where ancient Jews traditionally made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.",

      "A second U.S. aircraft carrier is operating in Mideast waters ahead of the next round of talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A second U.S. aircraft carrier is operating in Mideast waters ahead of the next round of talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, satellite photos analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed.",
      "The operation of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group in the Arabian Sea comes as suspected U.S. airstrikes pounded parts of Yemen controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels overnight into Tuesday. American officials repeatedly have linked the U.S.' monthlong campaign against the Houthis under President Donald Trump as a means to pressure Iran in the negotiations.",
      "Questions remain over where the weekend talks between the countries will be held after officials initially identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven't said where the talks will be held.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn\u2019t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented America in last weekend's talks in Oman, separately signaled that the Trump administration may be looking at terms of the 2015 nuclear deal that the president unilaterally withdrew from in 2018 as a basis for these negotiations. He described the talks last weekend as \u201cpositive, constructive, compelling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program, and then ultimately verification on weaponization,\u201d Witkoff told Fox News on Monday night. \u201cThat includes missiles, the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there. And it includes the trigger for a bomb.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe\u2019re here to see if we can solve this situation diplomatically and with dialogue.\u201d",
      "Satellite photos taken Monday by the European Union's Copernicus program showed the Vinson, which is based out of San Diego, California, operating northeast of Socotra, an island off Yemen that sits near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden. The Vinson is accompanied by the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton and two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, the USS Sterett and the USS William P. Lawrence.",
      "The U.S. ordered the Vinson to the Mideast to back up the USS Harry S. Truman, which has been launching airstrikes against the Houthis since the American campaign started March 15. Footage released by the Navy showed the Vinson preparing ordinance and launching F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets off its deck in recent days.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, which oversees the Mideast, declined to discuss details of the Vinson's operations.",
      "Meanwhile, Witkoff offered for the first time a specific enrichment level he'd like to see for Iran's nuclear program. Today, Tehran enriches uranium to up to 60% \u2014 a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "\u201cThey do not need to enrich past 3.67%,\u201d Witkoff told Fox News. \"In some circumstances, they\u2019re at 60%, in other circumstances, 20%. That cannot be.",
      "\u201cAnd you do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear program where you\u2019re enriching past 3.67%. So this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program, and then ultimately verification on weaponization.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal Iran agreed to with world powers under President Barack Obama saw Tehran agree to drastically reduce its stockpile of uranium and only enrich up to 3.67% \u2014 enough for its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Iran in exchange received access to frozen funds around the world, and sanctions were lifted on its crucial oil industry and other sectors.",
      "Iran's Javan newspaper, which is believed to be close to its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, suggested in an editorial Tuesday that Tehran would be open to reducing its enrichment.",
      "\u201cSomething that we have done before, why should we not carry it again and reach a deal?\u201d the editorial asked. \"This is not called a withdrawal by Islamic Republic from its ideals anywhere in the world.\u201d",
      "When Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, however, he pointed at Iran's ballistic missile stockpile as one reason to leave the deal. Witkoff said any deal with Iran would have to include \u201cmissiles, the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there and it includes the trigger for a bomb.\u201d",
      "Iran relies on its ballistic missiles as a hedge against regional nations armed with advanced fighter jets and other American weaponry. Getting it to abandon its missile program likely will be difficult in negotiations.",

      "The new government promised to protect minority groups, but when a group of Assad loyalists attacked security forces near the coastal city of Latakia last month, it sparked a counteroffensive that took a brutal toll on the coastal region\u2019s largely Alawite population.",
      "Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that more than 1,700 people, most of them civilians, were killed in March. While no official figures have been released by the government, other human rights groups have given similar estimates. It was the worst violence since an insurgency led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham overthrew Assad last December.",

Saleh said 18 people he knew personally who had previously been detained by Assad\u2019s forces were killed in last month\u2019s attacks.",

      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals so she doesn't miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish, and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose. Oh, what if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible. Some viewers on Tuesday posted photos of their dogs and cats staring at their televisions, enthralled by the moose on the screen.",

      "On Friday and Saturday, RSF fighters and their allies rampaged in two refugee camps in the western Darfur region, killing at least 300 people. The Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, which shelter some 700,000 Sudanese who fled their homes, have both been stricken with famine, and aid workers cannot reach them because of the fighting.",
      "Half the population of 50 million faces hunger. The World Food Program has confirmed famine in 10 locations and says it could spread, putting millions in danger of starvation.",
      "\u201cThis abominable conflict has continued for two years too long,\u201d said Kashif Shafique, country director for Relief International Sudan, the last aid group still working in the Zamzam camp. Nine of its workers were killed in the RSF attack.",
      "He said the world needs to press for a ceasefire. \u201cEvery moment we wait, more lives hang in the balance,\u201d he said. \u201cHumanity must prevail.\u201d",
      "Here is what is happening as the war enters its third year:",
      "The war erupted on April 15, 2023, with pitched battles between the military and the RSF in the streets of Khartoum that quickly spread to other parts of the country.",
      "It was the culmination of months of tension between the head of the military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF\u2019s commander, Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo. The two were once allies in suppressing Sudan\u2019s movement for democracy and civilian rule but turned on each other in a struggle for power.",
      "The fighting has been brutal. Large parts of Khartoum have been wrecked. Nearly 13 million people have fled their homes, 4 million of them streaming into neighboring countries. At least 20,000 people have been recorded killed, but the true toll is probably far higher.",
      "Both sides have been accused of atrocities, and the RSF fighters have been notorious for attacking villages in Darfur, carrying out mass killings of civilians and rapes of women.",
      "The military\u2019s recapture of Khartoum in late March was a major symbolic victory. It allowed Burhan to return to the capital for the first time since the war started and declare a new government, boosting his standing.",
      "But experts say the RSF consolidated its hold on the areas it still controls \u2014 a vast stretch of western and southern Sudan, including the Darfur and Kordofan regions. The military holds much of the north, east and center.",
      "\u201cThe reality on the ground already resembles a de facto partition,\u201d said Federico Donelli, an assistant professor of international relations at Universit\u00e0 di Trieste in Italy.",
      "Donelli said it\u2019s possible the two sides could seek a ceasefire now. But more likely, he said, the military will keep trying to move on RSF-held territory.",
      "Neither side appears able to defeat the other.",
      "\u201cBoth parties are suffering from combat fatigue,\u201d said Suliman Baldo, director of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker.",
      "The RSF is weakened by internal fissures and \u201clacks political legitimacy within the country,\u201d said Sharath Srinivasan, professor of international politics at Cambridge University.",
      "But it has strong access to weapons and resources, bolstered by support from the United Arab Emirates, Chad, Uganda, Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia, he said.",
      "\u201cWithout understanding the complex regional geopolitics of this war, it is easy to underplay the RSF\u2019s resilience and ability to strike back,\u201d said Srinivasan, author of \u201dWhen Peace Kills Politics: International Intervention and Unending Wars in the Sudans.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people trapped by the fighting face hunger and starvation. So far, the epicenter of famine has been in the North Darfur province and particularly the Zamzam camp. The RSF has been besieging the camp as it wages an offensive on El Fasher, the regional capital and the last main position of the military in the Darfur region.",
      "Amna Suliman, a mother of four living in the camp, said people have resorted to eating grass and tree leaves.",
      "\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d she said in a recent phone interview. \u201cWe live in fear, with no communication, no food, and no hope.\u201d",
      "Since famine was first declared in Zamzam in August, it has spread to other parts of the province and nearby South Kordofan province.",
      "The WFP warned this week that 17 other locations will also soon fall into famine \u2014 including other parts of the Darfur region but also places in central and south Sudan \u2014 because aid workers cannot reach them.",
      "\u201cThe situation is very dire,\u201d said Adam Yao, deputy representative of the U.N. Food and Agricultural Agency in Sudan.",
      "Already, at least 25 million people, more than half of the country\u2019s population, face acute hunger, including 638,000 who face catastrophic hunger, the most dire rating used by aid agencies, according to the WFP. Some 3.6 million children are acutely malnourished.",
      "In other areas, the military\u2019s capture of territory allowed aid groups to reach refugees and displaced people who have been largely cut off from aid for two years.",
      "Sudan has been hit by multiple outbreaks of cholera, malaria and dengue in the past two years. The latest cholera outbreak in March killed about 100 people and sickened over 2,700 others in the White Nile province, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "The economy has been decimated, with a 40% drop in GDP, according to the United Nations\u2019 Development Program, UNDP. Full-time employment has been halved and almost 20% of urban households reported that they have no income at all, it said.",
      "At the same time, U.N. agencies and aid groups have faced funding cuts from major donors, including the United States. Only 6.3% of the $4.2 billion required for humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year has been received as of March, said Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.",
      "\u201cThe reductions come at a time when the needs in Sudan have never been greater, with more than half of the population hungry and famine spreading,\u201d she said.",
      "About 400,000 people managed to return to their hometowns in areas retaken by the military around Khartoum and nearby Gezira province, according to the U.N. migration agency.",
      "Many found their homes destroyed and looted. They depend largely on local charities for food.",
      "Abdel-Raham Tajel-Ser, a father of three children, returned in February to his neighborhood in Khartoum\u2019s sister city of Omdurman after 22 months of displacement.",
      "The 46-year-old civil servant said he found his house, which had been occupied by the RSF, severely damaged and looted.",
      "\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he said of his return, adding that his life in the largely destroyed neighborhood with almost no electricity or communications is \u201cmuch better than living as a refugee or a displaced person.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Diplomats and aid officials from around the world are meeting Tuesday in London to try to ease the suffering from the 2-year-old war in Sudan, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 14 million and pushed large parts of the country into famine.",
      "The one-day conference, hosted by Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and the African Union, has modest ambitions. It is not an attempt to negotiate peace, but an effort to relieve what the United Nations calls the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Attendees include officials from Western nations, international institutions and neighboring countries \u2013 but no one from Sudan. Neither the Sudanese government nor the rival paramilitary it is fighting has been invited.",
      "\u201cThe brutal war in Sudan has devastated the lives of millions \u2013 and yet much of the world continues to look away,\u201d said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who visited Chad\u2019s border with Sudan in January. \u201cWe need to act now to stop the crisis from becoming an all-out catastrophe, ensuring aid gets to those who need it the most.\u201d",
      "Sudan plunged into war on April 15, 2023, after simmering tensions between the Sudanese military and a paramilitary organization known as the Rapid Support Forces. Fighting broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread across the country, killing at least 20,000 people \u2013 though the number is likely far higher.",
      "Over 300 civilians were killed in a burst of intense fighting in the western region of Darfur on Friday and Saturday, according to the U.N.",
      "Last month the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.",
      "The war has driven parts of the country into famine and pushed more than 14 million people from their homes, with more than 3 million fleeing the country, to neighboring countries including Chad and Egypt. Both sides in the war have been accused of committing war crimes.",
      "The World Food Program says nearly 25 million people \u2014 half of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 face extreme hunger.",
      "Aid agency Oxfam said the humanitarian catastrophe risks becoming a regional crisis, with fighting spilling into neighboring countries. It said that in South Sudan, itself wracked by recent war, \u201cthe arrival of people fleeing Sudan\u2019s conflict has put more pressure on already scarce resources, which is deepening local tensions and threatening the fragile peace.\u201d",
      "The U.S., which recently cut almost all its foreign aid, is expected to be represented at the London conference.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Lammy announced 120 million pounds ($158 million) in funding for the coming year to deliver food for 650,000 people in Sudan, from Britain\u2019s increasingly limited foreign aid budget.",
      "In February the U.K. cut its aid budget from 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product to 0.3% to fund an increase in military spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said Sudan, along with Ukraine and Gaza, will remain a priority for British aid.",

      "ACCRA, Ghana -- A newly created regulatory body for gold exports from Ghana announced Monday that foreigners would no longer be allowed to buy or trade artisanaly mined gold in the country, Africa\u2019s biggest gold producer.",
      "Starting May 1, gold must be bought with licenses from the new Ghana Gold Board, also known as GoldBod, according to a statement from the new body. Licenses previously issued by the Precious Minerals Marketing Co., which used to market minerals produced in the country, will no longer be valid.",
      "The statement said beginning next month no entity can purchase or deal in gold in the country apart from GoldBod, which was created to oversee gold trading and maximize revenue from its export.",
      "Under the law, GoldBod becomes the sole buyer, seller, assayer and exporter of all gold produced by licensed small-scale miners in Ghana, and those who do so without a license from the board will be charged criminally.",
      "Traditionally, local and foreign companies with export licenses had been able to buy and export gold from small-scale Ghanaian miners.",
      "On March 29, Parliament passed the Ghana Gold Board bill, which was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on April 2.",
      "Prince Kwame Minkah, spokesman for GoldBod, told The Associated Press that \"the trading activities of GoldBod is expected to culminate into building the needed reserves to enhance our forex and by extension deal with gold smuggling.\u201d",
      "The chronic challenge of illegal gold mining \u2014 known locally as \u201cgalamsey\u201d \u2014 was a major issue during Ghana\u2019s presidential election campaign last year and a source of concern for voters, triggering protests and criticism against the outgoing government.",
      "Ghana is the world\u2019s sixth largest gold producer, but the commodity has been increasingly mined illegally as people become more desperate to find jobs in a crumbling economy. The mining has polluted rivers and other parts of the environment, despite government actions to clamp down on the practice.",

      "The group noted that civilians and self-defense groups in both towns \u201chad repeatedly raised alarms that were ignored.\u201d",

The far-right leader was hospitalized due to problems related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary\u2019s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.",
      "The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Ahead of the vote \u2014 the final step for the amendment \u2014 opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.",
      "The amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary's contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "D\u00e1vid Bed\u0151, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz for the past 15 years \u201chave been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.\u201d",
      "He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, \u201cthey will do everything in their power to stay in power.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.",
      "Hungary\u2019s government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its \u201cchild protection\u201d policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls \u201cwoke ideology\" and \u201cgender madness.\u201d",
      "Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing base ahead of elections.",
      "\u201cThis whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children\u2019s rights,\u201d said D\u00e1nel D\u00f6brentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it \"pure propaganda.\u201d",
      "The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs wrote that the change is \u201cnot an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d",
      "D\u00f6brentey, the lawyer, said it was \u201ca clear message\u201d for transgender and intersex people: \u201cIt is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.\"",
      "The amendment is the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.",
      "\u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.",
      "\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.",
      "\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.",
      "The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",

      "Trump continued his criticism in a Truth Social post this weekend, when he said the U.S. did not want to attend the Group of 20 summit this year if it were held in South Africa, as scheduled. South Africa holds the rotational presidency of the G20 group of developed and developing nations and is due to host world leaders and top diplomats for a summit in Johannesburg in November.",

      "The South African government has denied white farmers are having their land seized or are victims of race-based killings, as Trump and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk have claimed. South Africa says those claims are based on misinformation.",
      "South Africa has passed a contentious new land expropriation law that allows land to be taken by the government without compensation if it's in the public interest. That has been criticized by some white minority groups as targeting their land, though no land has yet been taken under the law.",

      "LONDON -- China has warned the U.K. government to treat the Chinese owners of British Steel fairly or risk undermining investor confidence in the country, two days after British authorities took control of the company.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry made the comment on Monday as government-appointed managers raced to prevent British Steel from shutting down the last two blast furnaces in Britain that make so-called virgin steel from raw materials.",
      "Parliament on Saturday passed legislation authorizing the government to take control of the company and its Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020. Jingye still owns the company but British authorities have taken control of day-to-day operations.",
      "\u201cWe hope the British government treats Chinese enterprises investing and operating in the U.K. fairly and justly, protects their legitimate rights and interests, and avoids politicizing and over-securitizing economic and trade cooperation, so as not to affect the confidence of Chinese enterprises in investing and cooperating in the U.K.,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeperson Lin Jian said during the weekly press conference in Beijing.",
      "The U.K. government on Monday installed a new executive team at British Steel with the aim of ensuring \u201cconsistent and professional leadership\u201d of the Scunthorpe works in northeastern England, British Steel said in a statement.",
      "Two longtime British Steel executives, Allan Bell and Lisa Coulson, were named as the company\u2019s interim chief executive and chief commercial officer. The appointments were approved by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.",
      "Bell, who has worked at Scunthorpe for 14 years, said his main goal was to ensure continued steel production at the plant.",
      "\u201cOur immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce,\u201d Bell said in the statement.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday took the dramatic step of recalling Parliament from its spring recess to pass emergency legislation authorizing the government to take control of British Steel. Authorities were concerned about the plant\u2019s future after Jingye stopped ordering the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating.",
      "Once blast furnaces are shut down, it is difficult and expensive to restart them, raising concerns that Britain might lose the ability to make high-quality virgin steel needed by builders and railroads as the government tries to spur economic growth. Other British steelmakers are already in the process of shifting to electric arc furnaces that make steel from scrap metal.",

      "A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law has sparked intense backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous organizations",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law is drawing fierce backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous groups that warn it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under the guise of economic development.",
      "The amendment eliminates the requirement that landowners or companies get state authorization before converting forested land to other uses. Critics say the change could legitimize years of illegal deforestation.",
      "\u201cTo us, this is gravely concerning,\u201d said Alvaro Masquez Salvador, a lawyer with the Indigenous Peoples program at Peru\u2019s Legal Defense Institute.",
      "Masquez added that the reform sets a troubling precedent by \u201ceffectively privatizing\u201d land that Peru's constitution defines as national patrimony. \u201cForests are not private property\u2014they belong to the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Supporters of the amendment, enacted in March, say it will stabilize Peru\u2019s agricultural sector and provide farmers with greater legal certainty.",
      "The Associated Press sought comment from multiple representatives of Peru\u2019s agribusiness sector, as well as Congresswoman Maria Zeta Chunga, a vocal supporter of the law. Only one person in the agribusiness sector responded, saying they did not want to comment.",
      "Peru holds the second-largest share of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, with over 70 million hectares\u2014about 60% of Peru's territory, according to nonprofit Rainforest Trust. It\u2019s one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to more than 50 Indigenous peoples, some living in voluntary isolation. These communities are vital guardians of ecosystems and the rainforests they protect help stabilize the global climate by absorbing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.",
      "Passed in 2011, the original Forestry and Wildlife Law required state approval and environmental studies before any change in forest land use. But recent reforms have steadily weakened those protections. The latest amendment allows landowners and companies to bypass that approval, even retroactively legalizing past deforestation.",
      "Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld the amendment after a group of lawyers filed a constitutional challenge. Although the court struck down some parts of the amendment, it left intact the law\u2019s final provision, which validates past illegal land-use changes. Legal experts say this is the most dangerous part.",
      "In its ruling, the court acknowledged that Indigenous communities should have been consulted on reforms to the law and affirmed the Environment Ministry\u2019s role in forest zoning.",
      "Environmental lawyer C\u00e9sar Ipenza summed it up like this: \u201cThe court admits the law violated Indigenous rights and (tribes) should have been consulted but it still endorses the most harmful part.\u201d",
      "The push behind the reform mirrors dynamics seen under former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, where political and economic forces aligned to weaken environmental protections to favor agribusiness. While Brazil\u2019s effort was led by a highly organized, industrial agribusiness lobby, Peru\u2019s version involves a looser but powerful coalition.",
      "In Peru, support comes from agribusiness interests, land grabbers and figures linked to illegal mining and drug trafficking. Small and medium farmers with concerns about securing their land have also been swept into the effort.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a convergence of both legal and illegal interests,\u201d said Vladimir Pinto, the Peru field coordinator for Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "Julia Urrunaga, Peru director at nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency, warned that the Peruvian government is now \u201cfalsely arguing\u201d that the amendments are necessary to comply with the European Union\u2019s regulations, which will soon require companies importing products like soy, beef, and palm oil to prove their goods were not sourced from illegally deforested land.",
      "If products tied to illegal deforestation are later legalized and allowed into the market, that will weaken the effectiveness of demand-side regulations like those in the EU, she said.",
      "\u201cThis sends the wrong message to global markets and undercuts efforts to curb deforestation through trade restrictions,\u201d Urrunaga said.",
      "Olivier Coupleux, head of the Economic and Trade Section of the EU in Peru, has denied that recent changes to the law are linked to the EU\u2019s deforestation-free regulation.",
      "In interviews with Peruvian media, Coupleux has said the regulation aims to prevent the purchase of products linked to deforestation and does not require legal reforms, but rather traceability and sustainability in goods like coffee, cocoa, and timber.",
      "With no further recourse in domestic courts, civil society groups are preparing to take the case to international tribunals, warning that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for other countries seeking to circumvent environmental law under the banner of reform.",
      "For many Indigenous leaders, the law represents a direct threat to their territories, communities, and ways of life.",
      "Julio Cusurichi, board member of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest, said the measure will embolden land-grabbing and worsen environmental oversight in already vulnerable areas.",

Officials are focusing on providing low-cost loans, subsidies, and other financial incentives to stimulate investment in the semiconductor sector. The government aims to facilitate the development of advanced chips by expanding financial assistance for research and development activities and high-tech manufacturing equipment",
      "Officials also plan to boost spending on industrial infrastructure, including covering the larger part of the costs for building underground power transmission systems in semiconductor clusters in the cities of Yongin and Pyeongtaek, which have attracted investments from chip giants Samsung and SK Hynix.",
      "The government said in a statement that the plans aim to address uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies and to maintain the competitiveness of South Korea\u2019s chip industry. There are growing concerns that South Korean companies are falling behind rivals in Taiwan and other countries in producing high-tech chips for artificial intelligence and advanced applications, while Chinese competitors are rapidly closing the gap in memory chips.",

    "story": [
      "Erick Ojeda has no money",
      "MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- Erick Ojeda has no money. He returned to land almost empty-handed from an overnight trip fishing for shrimp. His sister and her newborn are waiting for him to pick them up from a hospital. He has had no luck finding a ride there, so he is still helping fishermen get boats out of the water and weigh what little they caught.",
      "The fishermen are all struggling, like most everyone in Venezuela, whose protracted crisis continues to evolve, entering a critical phase in recent weeks by further gutting people\u2019s purchasing power and laying the groundwork for a recession. This latest chapter in the 12-year crisis even prompted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to declare an \u201ceconomic emergency\" last week.",
      "Tired, hungry and worried, the fishermen don't complain and keep to their tasks, or nap, under a hut with a view of an oil tanker on Lake Maracaibo. They know they are lucky to have a source of income, unreliable as it is, in 2025.",
      "\u201cI have to keep toiling away even if work is bad,\u201d Ojeda, 24, said. \u201c We keep going trusting God. Let\u2019s see if God works miracles to fix all of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "The country\u2019s economy is unraveling yet again as key oil revenue dries up due to renewed economic sanctions punishing Maduro for electoral fraud and as his government finds itself with little wiggle room to respond despite some post-pandemic stability.",
      "Venezuelans emerged from the pandemic to fully stocked grocery stores and the U.S. dollar as the dominant currency for everyday transactions. They left behind years of bartering, lining up for hours outside supermarkets or even fighting on the streets for flour, rice, bread or other food items. They also stopped carrying bricks of worthless bolivar bills to pay for necessities.",
      "Those changes were the result of government decisions that eased price controls on basic goods and allowed consumers and businesses to use greenbacks without restrictions. They also occurred because the government used the Venezuelan Central Bank to inject millions of dollars into the foreign currency exchange market every week and prop up the bolivar.",
      "Those government measures helped end a yearslong cycle of hyperinflation, which had reached 130,000% in 2018. Gross domestic product grew 8% in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, after the economy shrank about 80% between 2014 and 2020.",
      "Maduro and his government began touting an economic renaissance of sorts. In the capital, Caracas, imported goods stores, restaurants, department stores and other businesses began to pop-up seemingly overnight. The use of ride-hailing and food-delivery apps proliferated. Some families in poor neighborhoods ventured into business ownership operating hot dog carts and other food stands.",
      "But the growth mostly concentrated in Caracas, and communities across the country, including Maracaibo, which prides itself in being the heart of the oil industry, did not see major gains.",
      "\u201cIf you pay more attention to those main avenues\u2026 you\u2019ll see that most of the businesses are closed,\u201d Luis Medina, 21, said pointing to an avenue in downtown Maracaibo. \u201cThere\u2019s a Subway that\u2019s closed, for example, and next to it is a Movistar (cellphone store), which is also closed. Next to it is an international restaurant, El Gaucho, originally from Argentina, which is closed, too.\"",
      "Like people in other Latin American countries \u2013 and long before their nation came undone in 2013 \u2013 Venezuelans have used the U.S. dollar as a safe haven asset and see the exchange rate as a measure of the economy\u2019s health.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government began using cash reserves in 2021 to artificially lower the exchange rate, making people at one point pay 3.50 bolivars for $1. That led to roughly 67% of retail transactions being made in foreign currency.",
      "The rate grew slowly, and by 2023, Maduro\u2019s efforts to inject dollars into the economy were aided by energy giant Chevron, which started regularly selling millions to banks to get bolivars to pay bills after the U.S. government let it to restart operations in Venezuela. The infusion of dollars allowed the government to maintain the rate around 35 bolivars to $1 through mid-2024, when the warnings of economists materialized.",
      "\u201cSo many of us said that \u2026 sooner or later, it was going to be unsustainable,\u201d economics professor Leonardo Vera said. \u201cIt was already evident in July that there were shortages of foreign currency in the official market in the face of growing demand, and those who couldn\u2019t get foreign currency began to move to the black market, a very small market where when a surge in demand arrives\u2026 the price goes up.\u201d",
      "This month, the official rate reached 70 bolivars to $1, but the black market hit 100 bolivars to $1 last month.",
      "Vera explained that factors influencing the price include Maduro\u2019s reelection claim, the results of the U.S. election and the decision of the Trump administration to revoke Chevron\u2019s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil.",
      "The Biden administration granted Chevron\u2019s permit in late 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela\u2019s political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in in January for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes.",
      "Before the official and black market rates grew apart considerably, formal and informal businesses applied the government\u2019s rate for transactions. These days, however, informal businesses, such as the food markets where the majority of Venezuelans buy groceries, favor the black market\u2019s rate, making some goods unaffordable.",
      "Prices have also increased at formal businesses, including grocery and hardware stores, because companies are setting them based on the expected higher cost to replenish their inventories.",
      "Economist Pedro Palma said Venezuela's inflation rate could be between 180% and 200%. He warned that people will cut spending because salaries will not keep up with inflation and some could even lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cWe have a truly dramatic outlook: on the one hand, skyrocketing inflation; on the other, the prospect of a very significant recession,\" Palma said.",
      "Maduro last week sent a decree to the ruling-party controlled National Assembly seeking powers to enact emergency measures to \u201cdefend the national economy,\u201d including suspending tax collections and establishing \u201cmechanisms and percentages for mandatory purchases of national production to promote import substitution.\u201d",
      "He attributed the decision mostly to the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the global economy, but Venezuela\u2019s latest economic troubles predated Trump\u2019s announcement. Weeks earlier, he also announced the shortening of state employees' workweek, effectively giving them ample time to pick up second jobs to complement their approximately $1.65 monthly minimum wage and $100 monthly stipends.",
      "But companies generally are not hiring, and some businesses are now paying employees in bolivars instead of dollars, which has increased the demand for greenbacks in the black market as exchange houses limit the sums available to the public.",
      "The latest economic developments were the greatest fears of many Venezuelans ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election. So much so that a nationwide poll conducted before the election showed that roughly a fourth of people were thinking about migrating, primarily for economic reasons.",
      "Nowadays, though, people largely appear to have abandoned that idea partly because of Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Taxi driver Jonatan Urdaneta has transported migrants from the bus station in Maracaibo to the nearest border crossing with Colombia for two years. For about 18 months, he made two roundtrips a day and so did dozens of other drivers. He can now go a day without a single trip.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s looking very bleak,\u201d Urdaneta, 27, said of his income prospects, standing next to his 1984 Ford sedan. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this improves when God allows.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips and products that contain them, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals",
      "BANGKOK -- The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals.",
      "The Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier.",
      "Although President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them \u2014 which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items \u2014 affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs for the sake of national security.",
      "The probe includes assessing the potential for U.S. domestic production of computer chips to meet U.S. demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs.",
      "Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on U.S. competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, \u201cforeign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity.\u201d",
      "After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs of up to 50% on some nations, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with \u201csector specific\u201d tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnd those are not available for negotiation,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThey are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country. We need to make medicine in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make semiconductors.\u201d",
      "The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them.",
      "Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said Monday, \u201cYeah, we're going to be doing that.\u201d",
      "He said it would be in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 70% of the materials, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, used to make medicines made in the United States are produced in other countries, with India, the European Union and China leading suppliers. The U.S. produces about a fifth of all pharmaceuticals made worldwide, but consumes about 45%, far more than any other country.",
      "The U.S. also is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas. It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips. In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92% of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8%.",
      "Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year. The administration's plans suggest that such electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-\u201creciprocal\u201d) tariffs \u2014 and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies.",
      "Although major computer chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. are investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing facilities, partly due to incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden's time in office, the costly process of changing entire supply chains would take years.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department said Monday that it was withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico, effective in 90 days. It said the current arrangement failed to protect U.S. growers from \u201cunfairly priced\u201d imports of tomatoes. Most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff, it said.",

      "Trump's flexibility has also fueled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up 0.8% Monday, but it's still down nearly 8% this year. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were elevated at roughly 4.4%.",

      "Even if the exemptions granted on electronics last week turn out to be short-lived, the temporary reprieve gives Apple some breathing room to figure out ways to minimize the trade war\u2019s impact on its iPhone sales in the U.S.",
      "That prospect helped lift Apple\u2019s stock price 2% on Monday. Still, the stock gave up some of its earlier 7% increase as investors processed the possibility that the iPhone could still be jolted by more tariffs on Chinese-made products in the weeks ahead.",

      "Despite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with President Donald Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele.",
      "Last week's federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted.",

      "Later Monday, two AP photographers were admitted to an event honoring Ohio State's championship football team on the more spacious South Lawn. A text reporter was turned away.",
      "Since mid-February, AP reporters and photographers have been blocked from attending events in the Oval Office, where President Donald Trump frequently addresses journalists, and on Air Force One. The AP has seen sporadic access elsewhere, and regularly covers White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s briefings. Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in the AP's lawsuit.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America.

      "If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes that you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension beyond the normal filing deadline, which is Tuesday.",
      "You're also permitted to write off a certain amount of loss due to disaster, reducing your tax burden. That could be damaged property, lost income, or small business losses.",
      "\u201cIt can feel really daunting and overwhelming, after you\u2019ve already lost your home or your vehicle, to tackle that project (of loss write-off). It can take time and a lot of energy,\u201d said Alison Flores, manager at the Tax Institute for H&R Block. \u201cWe see people be hesitant to tackle that, and so they leave that loss on the table.\u201d",
      "In the wake of a disaster, people are also more vulnerable to scams, so be extra vigilant as you prepare your taxes, even with the extra time of an IRS extension.",
      "\u201cScammers often pose as representatives of the IRS or FEMA to exploit victims of disasters,\u201d said Misty Erickson, tax content program manager at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cCommon scams include false promises of tax refunds, fake charities soliciting donations, and phishing attempts requesting personal or financial information.\u201d",
      "Here's what you should know:",
      "The IRS keeps an official list online of all disaster locations that qualify you for an extension to file.",
      "For the past year, individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton qualify for tax relief, as well as disaster victims in parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Alaska.",
      "Taxpayers in these areas have until May 1 to file returns and make payments, and there's no need to do any additional paperwork to receive that extra two week grace period. Filers also have the option to request additional extensions to October 15, but interest will accrue if any money due isn't paid by May 1.",
      "Individuals and businesses in southern California affected by wildfires and straight-line winds also qualify for automatic extensions due to disaster. Taxpayers in the relevant counties have until Oct. 15 to file returns and make payments.",
      "Any interest or fees that normally accrue on late payments won't accrue during disaster extensions. Most direct disaster relief is also not counted as income, and so is not taxed.",
      "While nothing is easy in the first days and weeks following a disaster, a few choices can help when seeking insurance reimbursement and at tax time.",
      "\u201cWe recommend saving media coverage,\u201d said Flores. \u201cIf your neighborhood was on the news showing the disaster, write down what date that was or record that copy. Anything that substantiates your losses and what condition your property was in is helpful.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, other steps include:",
      "\u2014 Taking photographs of damaged property or belongings to document and calculate the amount of your loss.",
      "\u2014 Keeping receipts for associated expenses, including contracted work on property damaged by disaster.",
      "\u2014 Keeping records of the original value of any property, including a home, car, jewelry, or big credit card purchases.",
      "Filing your insurance claims as soon as possible is also important, as you deduct any insurance reimbursement from disaster losses claimed on your tax return.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at a loss, it\u2019s often damage to your home, furnishings inside your home, vehicles, that kind of thing,\u201d Flores said. \u201cMost of the time, people will have home insurance and auto insurance, and file claims. That\u2019s the first step. The tax deduction is for loss that\u2019s not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance.\u201d",
      "The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief \u201ccasualty loss.\" Claiming casualty loss doesn't result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery.",
      "Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off.",
      "Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year \u2014 in that case, by filing an amended return.",
      "In the wake of a disaster, it's normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason.",
      "\u201cTaxpayers should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS or relief agencies,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cThe IRS never initiates contact via email, text, or social media to request sensitive information. When in doubt, taxpayers should verify correspondence by calling official numbers directly.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, you should watch out for:",
      "\u2014 Big paydays: The promise of more money than you think sounds reasonable. Bad advisers may make outlandish statements about available credits.",
      "\u2014 Threats and demands: Any pressure to pay for tax help \u201cnow or else,\u201d mentions of arrest or deportation, or refusals to let you question or appeal the taxes they say you owe.",

      "BANGKOK -- China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in U.S. tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, and analysts forecast sharp setbacks ahead.",
      "Imports fell 4.3% to $211.3 billion in March, the customs administration reported, far exceeded by exports worth $313.9 billion, leaving a trade surplus of $102.6 billion.",
      "\u201cBut shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.\u201d",
      "China's trade surplus surged to a record $992.2 billion in 2024 and its exports climbed 5.4%, helping to make up for sluggish growth at home as the country slowly recovers from a crisis in its property market and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States, based on the most recent revisions in Trump\u2019s trade policies. China has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. products and other measures meant to pinch the U.S. where it hurts most, such as controls on exports of critical minerals needed in high-tech manufacturing, such as electric vehicle production.",
      "China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States was $27.6 billion in March as its exports rose 4.5%. It logged a surplus of $76.6 billion with the U.S. in January-March even though exports were up only 2.3% the first two months of the year.",
      "\u201cSavvy U.S. importers likely saw tariff hikes coming in April onward and frontloaded imports,\u201d ING Economics said in a report, but that trend is likely to fall off as importers use up their inventories while they watch for the latest twists and turns in unpredictable U.S. trade policy.",
      "\u201cAs a result, it\u2019s likely that direct trade between the U.S. and China will crater starting in April,\u201d it said.",
      "Trade data already show some impact from the higher tariffs, with exports of lower value-added items like shoes and clothing falling, while shipments of computer chips, household appliances and vehicles surged. China\u2019s biggest exports in the first three months of the year were electronic machinery, a broad category that includes smart phones and laptops, and high-tech products, the report shows.",
      "China\u2019s exports of rare earths fell nearly 11% in the first quarter of the year as Beijing tightened controls on the strategically vital materials used in electric vehicles and other high-tech products.",
      "The customs data showed total exports from the world\u2019s second largest economy rose 5.8% in the first three months of the year from a year earlier while imports sank 7%, leaving a trade surplus of $273 billion.",
      "Late Friday, Trump exempted most computer-related goods from the higher China-specific tariffs, including laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them, though his administration says he plans to announce those within days. Such products accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year.",
      "Still, the harsh U.S. tariffs on Chinese products have raised questions about whether exporters might end up diverting their goods to other overseas markets as they give up on selling to American consumers due to the more than doubling of import duties.",
      "The biggest increases in exports in March were to China's Southeast Asian neighbors, which saw the dollar value of shipments from China jump 8% in March from a year earlier. Exports to Africa rose more than 11% and those to India by nearly 14%.",
      "A customs administration spokesperson, Lyu Daliang, said China was facing a \u201ccomplex and severe external situation\u201d but that the sky would not fall. He pointed to China\u2019s diversified export options and huge domestic market.",

      "\u201cThere are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war,\u201d Xi wrote in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media. \u201cOur two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.\u201d",
      "Xi's visit lets China show Southeast Asia it is a \u201cresponsible superpower in the way that contrasts with the way the U.S. under President Donald Trump presents to the whole world,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.",

Students of a drum art group performed as women waved the red and yellow Chinese and Communist Party flags.",
      "While Xi\u2019s trip likely was planned earlier, it has become significant because of the tariff fight between China and the U.S. The visit offers a path for Beijing to shore up its alliances and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese exports.",
      "In Vietnam, Xi will meet with Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, his counterpart, as well as the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.",
      "\u201cThe trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself against the from Trump,\u201d said Nguyen Khac Giang, pointing out that since Xi became the president in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice.",
      "The timing of the visit sends a \u201cstrong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,\u201d said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. She said that given the severity of Trump's tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development.",
      "Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the U.S and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with the U.S.",
      "In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, as businesses moved here. China is its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media.",
      "But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a \u201cvery precarious situation\u201d given the impression in the U.S. that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang, the analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.

      "LONDON -- Chinese companies will have to clear a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d when investing in key sectors in the U.K., the country's business secretary said Sunday, a day after he took effective control of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds said Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020, had not been negotiating \u201cin good faith\u201d with the government in recent months over the future of the heavily loss-making steel works in Scunthorpe in the north of England.",
      "Reynolds said it had become clear on Thursday that Jingye would not accept any financial offer from the government and that it was the company's intention to close the blast furnaces \u201ccome what may,\u201d while keeping the more profitable steel mill operations and supplying them from China.",
      "In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, he declined to accuse the company of deliberately sabotaging the business at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party, but did accept that there is now a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d to bringing Chinese investment into the U.K.",
      "\u201cI personally wouldn't bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think steel is a very sensitive area.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers back to Parliament on Saturday to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking Jingye from closing the two blast furnaces. The bill, which is now law, gives Reynolds the power to direct British Steel's board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running.",
      "The British government had been under pressure to act after Jingye\u2019s recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled.",
      "That would mean the U.K., which in the late 19th century was the world\u2019s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces.",
      "The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defense and rail and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at.",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Reynolds declined to give a full guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces going.",
      "He said he would not \u201cmake my situation or the nation\u2019s situation more difficult\u201d by commenting on specific commercial details.",
      "\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t acted, the blast furnaces were gone, steel production in the U.K., primary steel producing, would have gone,\" he said. \"So we\u2019ve given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that.\u201d",

      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.",
      "The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company\u2019s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google\u2019s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.",
      "Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel.",
      "The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration.",
      "To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what\u2019s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry\u2019s everyday workers have remained liberal \u2014 but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology.",
      "\u201cI think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\u201d said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry.",
      "\u201cThe shift hasn\u2019t been for a lot of people,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \u201cIt\u2019s a handful of people who\u2019ve gotten the attention.\u201d",
      "The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person and CEO of the world\u2019s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House\u2019s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington.",
      "Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors.",
      "Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe.",
      "It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk.",
      "Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still in the belly of the beast,\u201d said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \u201cIf the lake was frozen, there\u2019s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\u201d",
      "The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington\u2019s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world\u2019s problems.",
      "That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed.",
      "The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers\u2019 dreams of changing the world for the better. Google\u2019s motto was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth.",
      "Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re part of a startup, you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be absorbed in a way that\u2019s profitable.\u201d",
      "Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries.",
      "\u201cI feel sick to my stomach now,\u201d she said.",
      "Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden.",
      "\u201cI saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\u201d Sylvester said. \u201cIt was not all OK.\u201d",
      "It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration.",
      "At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs.",
      "But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump\u2019s challenges to the country\u2019s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley\u2019s top executives.",
      "\u201cThe money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\u201d said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust coming here, everyone\u2019s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\u201d Wood added. \u201cWe\u2019re all scared.\u201d",
      "Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift.",
      "\u201cThe trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\u201d",

      "Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby",
      "NEW YORK -- Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, you'll need to spend some time thinking about them.",
      "Keeping your documents organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits you're eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs.",
      "The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15.",
      "Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent.",
      "Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if it\u2019s pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app.",
      "\u201cJust take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together,\u201d Horn said.",
      "It's also good to keep your records for the future. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.",
      "If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, you\u2019ll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration.",
      "Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that people don\u2019t necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes it\u2019s it\u2019s too late,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "You can find out more about how to change your name on the Social Security Administration\u2019s website.",
      "One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said.",
      "To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but it\u2019s not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions.",
      "It\u2019s important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year.",
      "You can read more about each filing status on the IRS website.",
      "If you\u2019re planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding.",
      "Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.",
      "When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple.",
      "In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when you\u2019re filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time.",
      "It\u2019s important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after you\u2019ve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you,\" Grzes said.",
      "Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office.",
      "To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have.",
      "\u201cThe Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account.",
      "A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities,\u201d Grzes said.",

      "The 145% tariff from the U.S. and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge",
      "When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn't find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.",
      "But when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who\u2019s been exporting to the U.S. for more than a decade, was incredulous.",
      "\u201cThere's not a thread of feasibility,\" said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. \u201cIt looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Then came 50% more from Trump, followed by another hike \u2014 pushing the universal tariff on Chinese goods to the sky-high 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that the two leaders can communicate. \u201cWe are pausing the shipments,\" he said, \u201cuntil the leaders talk.\u201d",
      "The 145% tariff from the United States and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They're fretting not only about their next orders, but also the viability of their business if there's no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world's two largest economies could be unraveling.",
      "If the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, \u201cthat would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.",
      "Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center, said the sky-high tariff, if kept in place, amounts to \u201calmost a trade embargo,\u201d making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said.",
      "In China, the central tariff office flat-out declared there was \u201cno possibility for market acceptance\" of U.S. goods exported to China\u201d at the current tariff level.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty worried,\u201d said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. \u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there's no final number. And so everyone\u2019s still waiting to see how this will develop.\u201d",
      "The high-stakes tariff war has come more than 20 years after China \u2014 with the help of the United States \u2014 joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China's widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.",
      "The trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.",
      "During his four-year term, former President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to \u201cde-risk.\" He took the \u201csmall-yard, high-fence\u201d approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.",
      "Now, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on all Chinese goods but has said he's also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what his goals might be.",
      "\u201cWhat are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don't know what that would be,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.",
      "The message from China's leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops \u201cmaximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,\" said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that \u201cDonald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,\" Li said, and that Trump's policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.",
      "With no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.",
      "Lisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It's too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will \u201cdefinitely expand other avenues for sales,\u201d such as in Australia or Europe.",
      "In the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could \u201conly give up\u201d if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,\u201d Bo said. \u201cSo we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.\u201d",
      "In Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it's not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.",
      "At a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump's tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.",
      "For the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.",
      "Some might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. \u201cThe best plan is to not come into contact,\u201d said David Yu, who works in the company's foreign sales department.",
      "However, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as \u201creliable and without finicky demands.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the best market on Earth,\u201d he said. \"I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.\u201d",

      "The steep hike, compared to a 2.4% inflation rate for February, surprised financial analysts and worried Argentines who have become increasingly concerned that President Javier Milei's progress on lowering price increases might be stalling. The last time inflation rose this much on a monthly basis was in August 2024, when prices jumped 4.2%.",
      "The inflation numbers come at a critical juncture for South America's second-biggest economy. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund announced a new $20 billion loan agreement with Argentina. The IMF\u2019s executive board is expected to vote on the program later Friday.",
      "While Milei considers the IMF deal crucial to his efforts to stabilize Argentina's long troubled economy, the still-vague agreement has spread jitters among traders who expect that Argentina will have to impose a new monetary and foreign-exchange policy as a condition of receiving the cash. But further devaluing the peso, now pegged to the U.S. dollar, risks capital flight and even higher inflation.",

      "Experts say a slowdown in international trade might have a brief and slight benefit in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which come in part from fuels like gas and oil that are used to move goods around the world via ships, planes and vehicles. But any such benefit in reducing emissions, which cause climate change, will be swamped by sharply rising costs worldwide that will hurt efforts to transition to green energies.",
      "\u201cI would say it might help the climate in the first year or two if we have a downturn in economic activity or a recession, which no one wants,\u201d said Rob Jackson, head of the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor greenhouse gas emissions yearly. \u201cBut it will hurt the climate long-term because tariffs impact clean tech more than most other industries because of trade with China.",
      "\u201cAny emissions reduction would be temporary,\" said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown. \u201cI'm deeply skeptical that this would have positive impacts on climate change and in particular the energy transition.\u201d",
      "Climate experts have closely studied changes in world economic activity the last century, from the Great Depression to the recent coronavirus pandemic, looking for insights to help shape policies to reduce carbon emissions. A major U.S.-China trade war would be a very different dynamic than other recent slowdowns, as China produces much of the equipment needed for a transition to renewable energies, such as solar panels.",
      "Trump imposed, then suspended for 90 days, import taxes on dozens of countries Wednesday. He escalated his trade war with China, raising tariffs on its products to well above 100%. China makes more than 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels.",
      "The tariffs could slow global trade and economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and during the global financial crisis in 2009, then rebounded within a year.",
      "Jackson said he expects at most a 1% drop in emissions if full tariffs are implemented \u2014 significant, but far less than the 5.7% that his group calculated for the pandemic's first year. And Jackson noted that the world can't reach net-zero carbon emissions to try to limit future warming without structural changes, namely replacing fossil energy and manufacturing with clean renewable energy.",
      "\u201cA drop in emissions is important. But it boomerangs back to the same levels or keeps increasing afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really haven\u2019t done anything meaningful to address climate issues.\u201d",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, also thinks there could be a slight, temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions if tariffs paralyze businesses and people aren't working. But, he said, the higher prices for components for new renewable energy facilities will make some not economical to build and there will be far fewer imports of electric vehicles, both of which will lead to more emissions.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy to reduce emissions from road transport. The United States is a top importer of EVs and China is a top exporter.",
      "Renewable energy investor Excelsior Energy Capital announced Tuesday that it has raised just over $1 billion to continue investing equity in solar, energy storage, wind and other energy transition projects across the United States. Co-founder and managing partner Chris Moakley said they need stability and predictable costs \u2014 tariffs cause volatility.",
      "\u201cIf there is an increase in tariffs, I think there\u2019s going to be a time where we will have a slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall economics of these investments and transactions, there's going to need to be a reset.\u201d",
      "Grid-scale batteries and solar panels, as well as power transformers, are among the hardest hit by price increases on imports, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution. Batteries allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. Shepheard calculated a 55% price increase for grid-scale batteries if the tariffs are fully implemented on China, where about 80% of these batteries are manufactured, undermining the case for using solar and battery storage to satisfy a surging demand for electricity.",
      "If prices for renewables increase, the United States will turn more to fossil fuels, tying the nation to carbon-emitting power sources for decades, Shepheard added.",
      "President Joe Biden sought to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Trump began reversing the country\u2019s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. He's also moved aggressively against clean energy technologies, including halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters, canceling clean energy loans and threatening action against states' climate laws.",

      "Los Angeles-area residents whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January face a whole different set of struggles to their neighbors whose homes were burned to the ground",
      "All sense of survivors\u2019 guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\u201cEvery single item is a battle,\u201d said Maccalla. \u201cIt\u2019s denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\u201d",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents Unite, sharing environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve already had multiple people reach out and say: \u2018Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,\u2019\u201d said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \u201cThey should have a process to keep people safe because this isn\u2019t the first disaster like this.\u201d",

      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval of the settlement. In addition to asking for Monday's adjustments from attorneys on both sides of the case, Wilken has asked for objectors to respond to the new brief on Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys expect her final decision on the settlement to come in a matter of weeks, with the July 1 deadline bearing down.",
      "In what was supposed to be the final hearing a week ago, more than a dozen athletes and their lawyers outlines their objections to to the terms.",
      "Of all the arguments over the deal, which sets a template for schools to pay athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness and outlines $2.78 billion in back pay to athletes who played before NIL, those about roster limits appeared to make the biggest impact on Wilken.",
      "Under current rules, schools must adhere to a scholarship limit in each sport, but there are no roster limits. There are spots for walk-ons and partial scholarship recipients, all of whom can later qualify for aid.",
      "The new rules propose roster limits and make everyone eligible for scholarships. It could increase the total amount of aid available but is expected to cost athletes thousands of roster spots across the country as schools look to cut expenses to absorb higher costs.",
      "One example: Some women's swim teams currently divide 14 scholarships among 40 or more athletes. Under the new rules, most rosters would be capped at 30, but all those players could receive full rides.",
      "Wilken said figuring out a way to delay implementation wouldn't be that expensive and \u201cwould save a lot of good will and angst and unhappiness from a lot of students and their parents, so why not just do it?\u201d",
      "In their filing, attorneys said it would be too \u201cunworkable,\u201d with athletes perhaps seeking to start over after making a change: \u201cAnd every additional \u2018round\u2019 of re-dos permitted would create a new set of potentially affected student-athletes who might want re-dos themselves; with thousands if not more individual decisions having been made on the understanding the roster limits would likely go in effect in less than three months.\u201d",
      "The brief also argued that one of the most overlooked parts of the roster limits is how much more aid would go to athletes.",
      "\u201cIndeed, while it is unfortunate that a small number of athletes may ultimately have lost roster spots as a result of the settlement, the settlement afforded them an opportunity to compete for scholarships (or larger scholarships) and additional compensation and benefits that were not previously available,\u201d they attorneys wrote.",
      "The brief sought to address other concerns of the judge:",
      "\u2014 By agreeing to clarify that future Division I athletes -- they are covered under the 10-year term of the settlement even if they are not yet in college -- will have a chance to object to the deal and not release any claims until they have a chance to be heard or until their 60-day objection window ends. The defendants are hoping to avoid an endless series of court challenges over the same issues of athlete compensation.",
      "\u201cCollege sports would be entirely unmanageable if individual future college athletes (or groups of future athletes) pursued different types of injunctive relief year over year over year,\u201d the filing said. The settlement \u201cworks only if it is durable and applicable to all current and future class members.\u201d",
      "\u2014 By addressing what some objectors said were glitches in the system athletes use to calculate damages claims and asking the judge to OK a claims extension to May 16. A week ago, LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne told Wilken that the settlement hardly acknowledges her true value and potential earning power; the Monday filing said she would be among those receiving an updated allocation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",

      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",

      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the U",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.",
      "But that's an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China \u2014 the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "President Donald Trump offered some financial advice on Wednesday morning that ended up making a lot of money for any lucky investor who listened to him",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump offered some financial advice Wednesday morning, stocks were wavering between gains and losses.",
      "But that was about to change.",
      "\u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,\u201d he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social at 9:37 a.m.",
      "Less than four hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on nearly all his tariffs. Stocks soared on the news, closing up 9.5% by the end of trading. The market, measured by the S&P 500, gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days.",
      "It was a prescient call by the president. Maybe too prescient.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",
      "The question is, Was Trump already contemplating the tariff pause when he made that post?",
      "Asked about when he arrived at his decision, Trump gave a muddled answer.",
      "\u201cI would say this morning,\" he said. \u201cOver the last few days, I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201d",
      "He then added, \u201cFairly early this morning.\u201d",
      "Asked for clarification on the timing in an email to the White House later, a spokesperson didn't answer directly but defended Trump's post as part of his job.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,\" wrote White House spokesman Kush Desai.",
      "Another curiosity of the posting was Trump's signoff with his initials.",
      "DJT is also the stock symbol for Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of the president's social media platform Truth Social.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Trump was saying buying stocks in general, or Trump Media in particular. The White House was asked, but didn\u2019t address that either. Trump includes \u201cDJT\u201d on his posts intermittently, typically to emphasize that he has personally written the message.",
      "The ambiguity about what Trump meant didn't stop people from pouring money into that stock.",
      "Trump Media closed up 22.67%, soaring twice as much as the broader market, a stunning performance by a company that lost $400 million last year and is seemingly unaffected by whether tariffs would be imposed or paused.",
      "Trump\u2019s 53% ownership stake in the company, now in a trust controlled by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., rose by $415 million on the day.",
      "Trump Media was bested, albeit by only two-hundreds of a percentage point, by another Trump administration stock pick \u2014 Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Last month, Trump held an extraordinary news conference outside the White House praising the company and its cars. That was followed by a Fox TV appearance by his commerce secretary urging viewers to buy the stock.",
      "Tesla's surge Wednesday added $20 billion to Musk\u2019s fortunes.",
      "Kathleen Clark, a government ethics law expert at Washington University School of Law, says Trump's post in other administrations would have been investigated, but is not likely not to trigger any reaction, save for maybe more Truth Social viewers.",
      "\u201cHe's sending the message that he can effectively and with impunity manipulate the market,\u201d she said, \u201cAs in: Watch this space for future stock tips.\u201d",

    "summary": "The federal judge overseeing the wrongful deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia said she will order expedited discovery in order to \"apply the law to the facts.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia is entering his second month in an El Salvador mega-prison.",
      "The federal judge overseeing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia took Justice Department attorneys to task over their inaction Tuesday, ordering government officials to testify under oath in order to resolve Abrego Garcia's wrongful detention.",
      "Saying \"The Supreme Court has spoken,\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered expedited discovery -- in which officials are put under oath -- in order to \"apply the law to the facts.\"",
      "The judge told Justice Department lawyers that she was ordering expedited discovery \"specifically to determine whether you are fighting the court order, my court orders, whether you intend to abide by the court orders.\"",
      "\"You made your jurisdictional arguments, you made your venue arguments,\" Judge Xinis told the DOJ attorneys. \"You made your arguments on the merits. You lost. This is now about the scope of the remedy.\"",
      "In her subsequent written order granting expedited discovery, Judge Xinis said the Trump administration remains obligated to \"take steps available to them toward aiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.\"",
      "\"Defendants appear to have done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia's release from custody and return to the United States,\" Xinis wrote, saying that discovery is necessary in light of the Trump administration's refusal to disclose \"what it can\" or present justification for what they cannot disclose.",
      "Judge Xinis said Abrego Garcia is \"indisputably\" entitled to the due process the government has denied him and to be free from the risk \"of grave injury\" resulting from his detention in a notorious Salvadoran prison.",
      "The judge is ordering DOJ attorneys to provide discovery requests from Abrego Garcia's attorneys by April 21. She also ordered Abrego Garcia's attorneys to provide notice of depositions to the four government officials who have submitted status updates to the court.",
      "The depositions, according to Xinis, must be completed by April 23, with expedited discovery expected to be concluded no later than April 28.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration alleges is a member of the criminal gang MS-13, is entering his second month in an El Salvador mega-prison after he was deported there on March 15 despite being issued a 2019 court order barring his deportation to his home country due to the fear of persecution.",
      "In response to Judge Xinis' order for expedited discovery, DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said he doesn't believe discovery is appropriate because \"this is a legal dispute.\"",
      "Regarding the varying interpretations of what it means for the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release, Ensign asked Judge Xinis to clarify, for discovery, what \"facilitate\" means -- to which Xinis said she will issue an order \"which expands\" her view of the definition of \"facilitate.\"",
      "\"Until this matter is over and a final order is issued, we will operate within the parameters of that ruling, and it is consistent with the Supreme Court, and it is consistent with the plain meaning of the term,\" said Judge Xinis. \"And it is also consistent with the common practice in immigration law, when an individual is wrongfully removed from the United States.\"",
      "Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said they agree with the court's plan.",
      "Fifteen minutes before the hearing, DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazarra said in the Trump administration's daily status report to the court that the administration is \"prepared to facilitate Abrego Garcia's presence in the United States in accordance with those processes if he presents at a port of entry.\"",
      "However, Mazarra said, since Abrego Garcia is \"being held in the sovereign, domestic custody\" of El Salvador, DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract him \"from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "If Abrego Garcia does present at a port of entry, he would become subject to detention by DHS, due to his alleged membership in the criminal gang MS-13, said Mazarra.",
      "\"In that case, DHS would take him into custody in the United States and either remove him to a third country or terminate his withholding of removal because of his membership in MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organization, and remove him to El Salvador,\" Mazarra said.",
      "The development came a day after a highly anticipated Oval Office meeting in which the president of El Salvador said he would not return Abrego Garcia to the United States.",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News' Jay O'Brien Tuesday afternoon that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was the result of a \"clerical error.\"",
      "\"He should have been sent to a detention center in Mexico, Nicaragua, Egypt,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say Abrego Garcia, who escaped political violence in El Salvador 2011, is a member of the criminal gang MS-13, but to date they have provided little evidence of that assertion in court.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who has been living in Maryland with his U.S. citizen wife and 5-year-old child, is being held in El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, along with hundreds of other alleged migrant gang members, under an arrangement in which the Trump administration is paying El Salvador $6 million to house migrants deported from the United States as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, in an Oval Office meeting Monday with President Trump and the visiting El Salvador president, said that Abrego Garcia's return is \"up to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"If El Salvador ... wanted to return him, we would facilitate it,\" she said.",
      "Asked by reporters about Abrego Garcia, President Bukele responded, \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "In a motion filed Tuesday in advance of the hearing, lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued that the Trump administration has not taken any steps to comply with the orders to facilitate his release.",
      "\"There is no evidence that anyone has requested the release of Abrego Garcia,\" they wrote in the filing.",
      "The attorneys also took issue with the government's interpretation of the word \"facilitate,\" which the administration has argued in court filings is limited to removing any domestic obstacles that would impede the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States.",
      "Interpreting the term in that manner, Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued, would render \"null\" the Supreme Court's order that the government facilitate his release.",
      "\"To give any meaning to the Supreme Court's order, the Government should at least be required to request the release of Abrego Garcia. To date, the Government has not done so,\" they wrote in their motion.",
      "After Judge Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return, the Supreme Court last week unanimously ruled that Judge Xinis \"properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"The intended scope of the term 'effectuate' in the District Court's order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court's authority. The District Court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the Supreme Court wrote, which the Trump administration has interpreted as prohibiting the district court from ordering the executive branch to take any action that would violate the separation of powers.",
      "Judge Xinis subsequently amended her ruling to remove the word \"effectuate,\" leaving the order to \"facilitate.\"",
      "In an interview Monday evening with ABC News' Linsey Davis, an attorney for Abrego Garcia said he hopes Tuesday's hearing \"lights a fire under the government to comply with the Supreme Court's order\" to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release.",
      "\"What we're asking [of Trump] is exactly what the Supreme Court told him,\" attorney Benjamin Osorio said. \"I personally have worked with DHS before to facilitate the return of several other clients who were deported and then won their cases at circuit court levels or at the Supreme Court, and ICE facilitated their return.\"",
      "\"So we're not asking anybody to do anything illegal,\" Osorio said. \"We're asking them to follow the law.\"",
      "\"It feels a little bit like the Spider-Man meme where everybody's pointing at everybody else,\" Osorio said of Bukele's claim that he doesn't have the power to return Garcia. \"But at the same time, I mean, we are renting space from the Salvadorans. We are paying them to house these individuals, so we could stop payment and allow them to be returned to us.\"",
      "Asked if he is confident that Abrego Garcia will be returned, Osorio said he was concerned but hopeful.",
      "\"I'm worried about the rule of law, I'm worried about our Constitution, I'm worrying about due process,\" he said. \"So at this point, I am optimistic to see what happens in the federal court hearing.\"",

      "\u201cGambit\u201d had been beating its competition on NBC and ABC for over two years. But a new show debuted in 1975 on NBC called \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d By December 1976, \u201cGambit\u201d was off the air and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d became an institution that is still going strong today.",

      "He presided over the 88-game winning streak of Navy Lt. Thom McKee, who earned over $300,000 in cash and prizes that included eight cars, three sailboats and 16 vacation trips. At the time, McKee\u2019s winnings were a record for a game show contestant.",
      "\u201cI love working with contestants, interacting with the audience and to a degree, watching lives change,\u201d Martindale wrote. \u201cWinning a lot of cash can cause that to happen.\u201d",

      "Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.",
      "Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was \u201cIs Wink your real name?\u201d The second was \u201cHow did you get into game shows?\u201d",
      "He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.",
      "Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.",
      "He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.",
      "After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson\u2019s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.",
      "Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record \u201cThat\u2019s All Right\u201d was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.",

By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale\u2019s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of \u201cG.I. Blues\u201d in 1960.",

I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!\u201d Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.",

      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, \u201cBumper Stumpers,\u201d ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990.",
      "He hosted \u201cDebt\u201d from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and \u201cInstant Recall\u201d on GSN in 2010.",

      "No judge has held a member of the Trump administration in contempt of court.",
      "In the nearly three months since President Donald Trump's inauguration, lawyers challenging his actions in court have alleged that his administration has violated court orders on a half dozen occasions, according to court records reviewed by ABC News.",
      "From unilaterally freezing federal funding to the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport noncitizens, the clashes have raised concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for a constitutional crisis.",
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration have alleged the government violated or ignored court orders on at least six different occasions, but no judge so far has held a member of the Trump administration in contempt of court. On at least four occasions, judges have expressed concerns about the Trump administration's compliance with court orders.",
      "Lawyers with the Justice Department have vigorously defended the actions of the Trump administration and argued that federal officials have strictly complied with lawful court orders, while also questioning the legality of some orders. Each of the cases are ongoing or being appealed, so the district court orders may be vacated as higher courts weigh in.",
      "Trump has repeatedly vowed to respect a court order even if a judge rules against parts of his agenda, though he has attempted to cast doubt on the authority of some judges.",
      "\"Well, I always abide by the courts and then I'll have to appeal it,\" Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott in February, referencing cases involving Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. In those cases, Trump suggested a judge's order \"slowed down the momentum, and it gives crooked people more time to cover up the books. You know, if a person's crooked and they get caught, other people see that and all of a sudden it becomes harder later on.\"",
      "The Trump Administration now faces arguably its most high-profile legal battle, as it attempts to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Salvadoran custody despite the Supreme Court ordering his administration to facilitate his release.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration removed more than 100 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to a Salvadoran prison under the Alien Enemies Act despite a federal judge ordering they be returned to the U.S.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued a directive that two planes carrying the men to El Salvador be returned to the United States on March 15. Despite both planes still being in the air at the time of the order, the planes landed in Honduras before flying to El Salvador.",
      "Lawyers representing the Venezuelan men have argued that the Trump administration violated the court order, and Judge James Boasberg remarked that the government \"acted in bad faith\" when it rushed the deportation flights.",
      "The Supreme Court vacated his order blocking any future removals under the Alien Enemies Act because the plaintiffs lacked jurisdiction to bring a case in D.C. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, Judge Boasberg was considering beginning contempt proceedings.",
      "Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act \u2013 telling reporters last month that he has the authority to remove noncitizens under the law \u2013 and has repeatedly criticized Judge Boasberg for blocking the removals.",
      "\"[Secretary of State Marco Rubio has] the authority to get bad people out of our country. And you can't stop that with a judge sitting behind a bench that has no idea what goes on, who happens to be a radical left lunatic,\" Trump told ABC's Karen Travers.",
      "After the Trump administration acknowledged it had deported a Salvadoran native who was living in Maryland under protected legal status due to an \"administrative error,\" a federal judge ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.",
      "After the Trump administration appealed the decision, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that Judge Paula Xinis \"properly\" required that the U.S. facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody; however, the high court ordered Judge Xinis determine what \"deference\" Trump is owed related to his conduct of foreign affairs.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling, the Trump administration has doubled down on its allegation that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 -- without providing any evidence -- and claimed it lacks the authority to return him to the U.S. During a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele told reporters that he lacks the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.",
      "\"The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?\" Bukele said.",
      "Benjamin Osorio, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, told ABC News that he believes the Trump administration is defying the court's order and that a contempt order might be the only thing to prompt the U.S. government to return his client from El Salvador.",
      "Before his meeting with Bukele, Trump told reporters that he would respect an order from the Supreme Court to return Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,\" Trump said.",
      "During a hearing last week, a federal judge gave lawyers with the Justice Department two weeks to provide more information about three recent removals of noncitizens to El Salvador that took place two days after he issued a temporary order blocking similar deportations to countries other than their place of origin without a hearing to raise concerns about their safety.",
      "Judge Brian Murphy described the \"potential violations of the temporary restraining order\" as \"concerning\" and set an April 28 hearing to learn more about the deportations.",
      "\"This is something that is concerning to me,\" Judge Murphy said. \"I do think it's something that we need to address.\"",
      "Lawyers with the Justice Department agreed to provide more information about the removals and defended the administration's conduct.",
      "Judge Murphy is considering extending his court order that prevents the Trump administration from removing noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin without allowing the noncitizens to raise concerns about their safety.",
      "Two days after Judge Murphy temporarily blocked the deportations, the Trump administration announced that it had removed 17 alleged members of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to the plaintiffs, some of the men on those flights had final orders of removal to Venezuela and were never given the right to challenge their removal to El Salvador.",
      "In February, U.S. District Judge John McConnell said that a group of state attorneys general presented evidence that the Trump administration \"continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds\" to states despite a \"clear and unambiguous\" order barring them from blocking the funding.",
      "He ordered the government to \"immediately restore frozen funding\" though the state attorneys general later provided evidence that the Trump administration continued to pause funding from FEMA. Many of the funding streams were restored in the months following Judge McConnell's order.",
      "Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued the limiting of funds was a lawful way to identify and limit alleged fraud.",
      "Two months after Judge McConnell ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funding to states, he determined that the government \"covertly\" paused millions of dollars in FEMA funding in direct violation of a court order.",
      "Judge McConnell ordered the Trump Administration to \"immediately cease\" its efforts to impede the disbursement of federal funds, finding the government directly violated his order.",
      "Last month, a coalition of 22 attorneys general asked Judge McConnell to stop the freeze after they presented evidence that FEMA continued to restrict more than 215 federal grants despite a court order blocking Trump's unilateral funding freeze.",
      "Lawyers with the DOJ pushed back on the request, arguing that FEMA was \"merely implementing a manual review process\" of each grant.",
      "Judge McConnell disagreed, finding that the states presented \"undisputed evidence\" that FEMA \"essentially [imposed] an indefinite categorical pause on payments\" in direct violation of his preliminary injunction. He said the manual review process cited by the Trump administration \"violates\" a preliminary injunction issued in the case.",
      "A federal judge in February determined that the Trump administration was improperly withholding nearly $2 billion in foreign aid despite an order to restore the funding.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali blocked the Trump administration from imposing a blanket freeze on funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, yet the freeze continued for weeks, according to lawyers representing the foreign aid nonprofits. Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued the funding freeze was necessary to identify and block potential fraud.",
      "In an order, Judge Ali wrote that the Trump administration justified the freeze by advancing \"an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected\u2014a view that flouts multiple statutes.\"",
      "After the Trump administration appealed the order, a divided U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to block the order, though the justices ordered the lower court to clarify its original order.",

Chuck Grassley, pressing him on their concerns with the Trump administration\u2019s deportation operation, the administration\u2019s tariff policy, and government overreach.",
      "At Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall in her district in Georgia, three people were removed from the event minutes after it started.",
      "Almost immediately after the congresswoman took the stage, a man was dragged out by police officers. Shortly after that, another attendee shouted from the audience. Greene ordered him to leave, and he exited, trailed by an officer. Moments later, a third man was tackled and dragged out by police. When he attempted to reenter, officers tased him.",
      "Before her town hall, Greene warned, \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to act up, scream and protest, you\u2019re going to be thrown out.\u201d",
      "Many in Grassley's audience in Iowa expressed concerns over the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to comply with court orders to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a prison in El Salvador, arguing Grassley and Congress haven\u2019t adequately provided checks and balances on the Trump administration, allowing him to defy court orders.",
      "\u201cYou going to bring that guy back from El Salvador?\u201d an audience member shouted.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a power of Congress,\u201d Grassley responded.",
      "\u201cEl Salvador is an independent country \u2026 The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d he added later.",

      "Grassley is among a handful of Republican members of Congress to hold town halls during its spring recess. GOP leadership has advised their members to avoid in-person town halls after several members were grilled in their home districts earlier this year.",
      "At Grassley's town hall, another audience member asked, \u201cWe would like to know what you, as the people, the Congress, who are supposed to rein in this dictator, what are you going to do about these people who have been sentenced to life imprisonment in a foreign country with no due process?\u201d",
      "Before Grassley could answer, other members of the audience shouted about the lack of due process.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re allowing it to happen!\u201d",
      "During a gaggle with reporters after the town hall wrapped, Grassley again attempted to argue that the administration isn't \"responsible\" for bringing Garcia back to the U.S. if El Salvador refuses to comply.",
      "One reporter asked, \u201cDo you have concerns that Donald Trump is inching toward a constitutional crisis, or has already reached one when he chooses not to follow the court orders to make plans for his return?\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, it's not a question of the president following the court order. It's a question of is the president of El Salvador going to do what our Supreme Court wants done? And obviously our Supreme Court doesn't have any control over him, and he says he's not going to return him,\" Grassley said. \"So if there's a constitutional crisis, it's not being caused by President Trump, it's being caused by the president of El Salvador.\"",
      "\u201cI would expect our president to act in good faith, and I think our president will do that, of making those requests of the president of El Salvador, but whether or not, but how the president of El Salvador responds would be up to that president of El Salvador,\u201d he added.",
      "During the town hall, members made it known to Grassley that they believed there was more he could be doing to address their concerns about Trump and his actions since taking office.",
      "\u201cAre you proud of voting for Trump, what he\u2019s doing in office? Are you proud of everything he\u2019s doing right here?\u201d one asked.",

    "story": [
      "The White House has put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by the news agencies that serve media outlets around the world",
      "Fresh from a courtroom loss over The Associated Press' access to the presidency, the White House on Tuesday put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by news agencies that serve media outlets around the world. It was the latest attempt by the new administration to control coverage of its activities.",
      "The move would block the AP and other wire services that serve billions of readers through thousands of news outlets. It comes after a judge ruled the White House had violated the organization\u2019s free speech by banning it because it disagreed with the outlet\u2019s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "While outlining a new \u201cpool coverage\u201d policy for small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, the White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss, according to people who have seen the plan.",
      "The White House did not return messages for comment on Tuesday evening.",
      "A federal judge last week ruled the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico by blocking its reporters and photographers from covering the events. U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the administration to treat the AP as it does other news organizations.",
      "A day after defying McFadden's ruling and continuing AP's ban when Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele met with reporters in the Oval Office, the White House leaked a new policy to selected journalists.",
      "For many years, the White House Correspondents Association has run the pool for the limited space events, and each time it has included reporters from the wire services AP, Reuters and Bloomberg. One print reporter was also allowed, selected on a rotating basis from more than 30 news outlets.",
      "The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots \u2014 meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used in multiple locations around the country and the planet.",
      "Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump's press secretary \u201cshall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.\u201d The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in \u201cirrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the AP's Lauren Easton said the outlet was deeply disappointed that rather than restore the AP's access, the White House instead chose restrictions over all of the wire services.",
      "\u201cThe wire services represent thousands of news organizations across the U.S. and the world over,\u201d said Easton, an AP spokeswoman. \"Our coverage is used by local newspapers and television stations in all 50 states to inform their communities.",
      "\u201cThe administration's actions continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation,\u201d Easton said Tuesday night.",
      "The independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the administration\u2019s insistence on retaining control over who covers the president shows that it is unwilling to guarantee that it would not continue \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government should not be able to control the independent media that covers it,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, the association\u2019s president.",
      "Under Leavitt, the White House has given greater access to news outlets friendly to Trump. That was visible Tuesday, when the first reporter Leavitt addressed during a briefing asked two questions while also praising Trump policy.",
      "At Monday's Oval Office meeting, Trump bristled at questions from CNN's Kaitlan Collins about a man deported to an El Salvador prison, at one point accusing CNN of \u201chating our country.\u201d He made it a point to contrast her questions with a non-pointed one from another reporter.",
      "Despite the occasional fireworks, Trump has made himself accessible to the media more than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Cramped-quarters events, particularly in the Oval Office, are some of his favorite places to talk \u2014 rendering the new access policy all the more impactful.",
      "The new policy advanced on Tuesday did not address access for photographers. At an earlier court hearing about the AP's case, the outlet's chief White House photographer, Evan Vucci, and correspondent Zeke Miller testified about how the ban has hurt the business of a news agency built to quickly get news and images to its customers.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. McFadden agreed with AP's argument that the government cannot punish the news organization for what it says \u2014 for exercising its right to free speech.",
      "The White House has argued that press access to the president is a privilege, not a right, that it should control \u2014 much like it decides to whom Trump gives one-on-one interviews. In court papers filed last weekend, his lawyers signaled that even with McFadden's decision, the AP's days of unchallenged access to open presidential events were over.",
      "\u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d",
      "The administration has appealed McFadden's ruling, and is scheduled to be in an appeals court on Thursday to argue that ruling should be put on hold until the merits of the case are fully decided, perhaps by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The administration has not curtailed AP access to Leavitt's briefings over the past two months. It has blocked access to events in the East Room to White House-credentialed AP reporters \u2014 until Tuesday, when one was allowed into an event that involved the Navy football team.",

      "Any effort to deport an American citizen to a prison in El Salvador (its CECOT prison has been criticized for alleged human rights abuses) or elsewhere would likely be a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, Frost said.",
      "One potential loophole could be for the Trump administration to try to target naturalized U.S. citizens, who can lose their immigration status if they've committed treason or falsified information during their naturalization process. But those instances are rare.",
      "\"If someone\u2019s a naturalized citizen, there could be an effort to denaturalize that person and deport them,\" Frost said. \"But then it would have to be that they committed some sort of fraud or error in their naturalization process. An unrelated crime could not be the basis for denaturalizing and deporting somebody.\"",
      "Still, experts were alarmed by Trump's comments on wanting to send American citizens to foreign prisons -- especially as the legal battle regarding Kilmar Abrego Garcia continues to play out.",
      "Abrego Garcia is being held at CECOT after being wrongfully deported by the Trump administration last month. Trump and other officials claim he is a MS-13 gang member, though the administration has provided little evidence of that in court.",
      "The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and say he was deported illegally. Bondi on Monday said it was \"up to El Salvador\" to return him, and Salvadoran President Bukele said he wouldn't do so.",
      "\"That is chilling,\" Frost said, \"because if that's their view, then assuming they can manage to get people out of the country, they could then throw up their hands and say, 'We can do nothing about it.'\"",
      "ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott on Tuesday asked Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan if he believed it was illegal for Trump to send Americans to an El Salvador prison. Homan said he hasn't talked to the president yet.",
      "\"The notion is just so absurd,\" Leopold, the former president of American Immigration Lawyers Association, said. \"If it wasn't so terrifying that a sitting president of the United States so loosely uses rhetoric about deporting United States citizens, it would be laughable.\"",

    "summary": "Harvard's defiance marks first major pushback against administration's attempts to reform elite universities.",
    "story": [
      "Harvard faculty asked a federal judge to block the president's efforts Monday.",
      "After Harvard University said it is refusing to comply with a series of demands from President Donald Trump's administration, the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced a multi-billion-dollar freeze on funding to the university.",
      "The administration's task force said on Monday evening it would withhold $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in multi-year contract value to the institution.",
      "\"The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,\" the task force said in a statement.",
      "The decision comes after\u00a0Harvard University President Alan Garber said in a letter on Monday, the school \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights\" by agreeing to a series of terms proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "The Trump administration had demanded that Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion programs; adopt merit-based admissions; and cooperate with immigration authorities -- or risk losing $9 billion in federal funding. Garber at the time said the loss of funding would \"halt life-saving research.\"",
      "Garber said the loss of funding based on policy choices violates the first amendment and would \"halt life-saving research.\"",
      "Harvard's rejection of Trump's demands marks the first time a major university has pushed back against funding threats made by the Trump administration.",
      "In a letter on April 11, the Trump administration argued that the school \"failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment\" and proposed terms including changing the school's governance, adopting merit-based hiring, shuttering any DEI programs and allowing \"audits\" to ensure \"viewpoint diversity.\"",
      "In response, Harvard's president said the school is committed to making changes to create a \"welcoming and supportive learning environment\" and reaffirmed the school's vow to fight antisemitism. However, he argued the Trump administration's requests would go too far.",
      "\"The administration's prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard's First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government's authority under Title VI,\" Garber wrote. \"And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government -- regardless of which party is in power -- should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\"",
      "The letter came days after faculty members at Harvard University asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration's attempt to cut off billions in funding, arguing the threat of a funding cut is an \"existential 'gun to the head' for a university.\"",
      "In a lawsuit filed on April 11, two groups representing the faculty of Harvard University argued that the Trump administration is overstepping its authority by \"undermining free speech and academic inquiry in service of the government's political or policy preferences.\"",
      "\"This case involves an unprecedented threat from the Trump administration to withhold nearly nine billion dollars in federal funding to one of our nation's leading universities unless it accedes to changes that fundamentally compromise the university's independence and the free speech rights of its faculty and students,\" the lawsuit alleged, asking a judge to issue an emergency order that would bar the Trump administration from making funding conditional on policy changes.",
      "The American Association of University Professors and its chapter at Harvard argued that the Trump administration failed to follow the specific procedure put in place by the Civil Rights Act to terminate funding, instead threatening to terminate $255 million in funding, in addition to nearly $9 billion in multiyear grants, unless the school implements a series of policy changes.",
      "\"These sweeping yet indeterminate demands are not remedies targeting the causes of any determination of noncompliance with federal law. Instead, they overtly seek to impose on Harvard University political views and policy preferences advanced by the Trump administration and commit the University to punishing disfavored speech,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "Others within the higher education community have stood with Harvard in its response.",
      "Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president of the advocacy group the Education Trust, told ABC News the decision by Garber to reject the administration's demands is being celebrated throughout the higher education community.",
      "\"What it really represents for higher education is hope,\" Del Pilar said, adding: \"It represents hope for institutions that have been afraid to stand up to an administration that is trying to implement its will, on not only the admissions of institutions, but ultimately on the curriculum as well.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who went to Harvard Law School, praised Harvard University for its rejection of Trump\u2019s demands in a post on social media late Monday.",
      "\u201cHarvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions -- rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s hope other institutions follow suit.\u201d",
      "Obama did not specifically address the funding freeze announced by the Trump administration.",
      "The confrontation follows similar actions against other prestigious universities.",
      "Last month, Columbia University agreed to comply with the administration's demands regarding campus policies and governance after its federal funding was suspended following campus protests. The agreement came after the administration cited concerns about antisemitism and public safety.",
      "The Department of Education has also initiated investigations into Cornell University and Northwestern University, according to White House officials. The Trump administration has halted more than $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell and $790 million to Northwestern due to investigations into alleged civil rights violations.",

      "The lawsuit claims that their legal status was \"illegally\" terminated.",
      "International students pursuing degrees at Michigan public universities sought relief from detention and deportation during a federal court hearing on Tuesday, after their student immigration status was terminated this month, jeopardizing their legal status in the U.S.",
      "The students -- two citizens of China, one of Nepal and another from India -- filed a lawsuit on Friday against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and immigration officials, claiming that their student immigration status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was illegally terminated \"without sufficient notice and explanation.\"",
      "SEVIS is a database that tracks information about nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors in the U.S.",
      "\"According to the government, they no longer have legal status in the U.S., and they have to leave the country immediately,\" Ramis Wadood, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan who is representing the students, told ABC News.",
      "He noted that the students didn't get any kind of grace period.",
      "\"You no longer have status, and have to leave the country right away,\" Wadood said.",
      "The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court by the ACLU of Michigan on behalf of the students -- Xiangyun Bu, Qiuyi Yang, Yogesh Joshi and Chinmay Deore. According to the complaint, in addition to their student immigration status being terminated, Yang and Joshi were told that their F-1 student visas, which allowed them to enter the country, were also revoked.",
      "\"None of them has been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime in the United States,\" the complaint said. \"None has violated any immigration law. Nor have they been active in on-campus protests regarding any political issue.\"",
      "The students' attorneys argued during a Tuesday morning hearing in a Detroit federal court for a temporary restraining order that would restore their legal status and protect them from arrest or deportation as the case moves forward.",
      "According to Wadood, the judge indicated that he \"recognized the urgency of the situation and said he would rule soon.\"",
      "Wadood told ABC News on Monday that his clients are at risk of being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and are \"scared\" and have stopped showing up to classes in person.",
      "\"Our clients have been allowed to continue their studies to the extent that their professors and their programs will accommodate,\" Wadood said, adding that they are trying to resume their studies remotely since \"they're at risk of arrest and detention at any point.\"",
      "The lawsuit names DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and ICE Detroit Field Office Director Robert Lynch. ABC News reached out to the officials but requests for comment were not immediately returned.",
      "\"DHS did not provide the students or their schools any meaningful explanation for terminating their F-1 student status,\" the complaint said. \"At most, what seems to connect students targeted by this newfound and unlawful policy is that the students had some encounter with some American law enforcement official at some point in the past, no matter how innocuous -- including receiving a speeding or parking ticket (or even a warning) or lawfully withdrawing an application to enter the United States.\"",
      "Court records show four separate letters that each of the students received from their prospective universities informing them that their student immigration status has been terminated. The reason cited by DHS in all cases is \"individual identified in criminal records check,\" and for Yang and Joshi it also says \"and/or revoked visa.\"",
      "The Trump administration filed a response on Monday evening to the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order, urging the judge to \"deny this request because it is procedurally and substantively improper.\"",
      "\"An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order may only be used to maintain the status quo; it cannot be used to obtain the ultimate relief plaintiffs seek in this case, which is the alteration of their SEVIS record,\" it said.",
      "The government also alleged in Monday's filing that the students have criminal records, but did not provide additional details.",
      "\"DHS searched criminal records for each of the plaintiffs and criminal history matches were returned for each of the plaintiffs,\" its response said.",
      "Wadood denied that any of his clients have ever been charged with or convicted of a crime. He said that in explaining their reference to \"criminal records,\" the government cited three of his clients who were detained for alleged domestic disputes.",
      "They were subsequently released and not charged with any crimes, while one plaintiff \"doesn't have as much as a simple speeding ticket or parking ticket\" on their record, according to Wadood",
      "\"Our plaintiffs' criminal history is clean. They have no convictions, no charges,\" he said.",
      "The federal lawsuit comes as the Trump administration's immigration crackdown strikes higher education, prompting a slew of lawsuits against White House officials. Similar lawsuits have been filed across the country in states like New Hampshire, Indiana and California.",
      "According to Inside Higher Ed -- a publication that tracks news in higher education -- as of Tuesday over 180 colleges and universities have identified nearly 1,200 international students and recent graduates who have had their legal status changed by the State Department.",
      "\"If the courts don't put an end to this arbitrary government action, then generations of future international students are going to see what's happening today and decide, 'You know what, it's probably not safe for me to go to the U.S to study'\" Wadood said. \"And our academic institutions, our academic communities, are going to be so much worse off because of it.\"",
      "The Trump administration appears to be targeting some international students with student visas and green card holders for their participation in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses or for alleged criminal records.",
      "\"A visa is a gift. It's a voluntary thing. We decide to give you a visa,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said during a March 28 press conference. \"We deny visas all over the world every day for a variety of reasons, and that means we can also revoke those visas.

      "Health secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- As measles outbreaks popped up across the U.S. this winter, pediatricians waited for the nation's public health agency to send a routine, but important, letter that outlines how they could help stop the spread of the illness.",
      "It wasn't until last week \u2014 after the number of cases grew to more than 700, and a second young child in Texas had died from a measles infection \u2014 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally issued its correspondence.",
      "The delay of that letter may seem minor. But it is one in a string of missteps that more than a dozen doctors, nurses and public health officials interviewed by The Associated Press identified in the Trump administration's response to the outbreak.",
      "Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to contain an epidemic in a tight-knit, religious community in West Texas have run counter to established public health strategies deployed to end past epidemics.",
      "\u201cWhat we are lacking now is one, clear strong voice \u2014 from the federal to the state to the local \u2014 saying that the vaccine is the only thing that will prevent measles,\" said Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse and infectious disease expert who helped stop a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota's Somali community.",
      "Behind the scenes, Kennedy has not been regularly briefed in person on the outbreak by his own infectious disease experts at the CDC at least through March 21, according to Kevin Griffis, a career staffer who worked as the agency's communications director until he resigned that day.",
      "Even after the measles claimed its first young Texas victim in late February, Kennedy had still not been briefed by CDC staff, Griffis said. His account was confirmed by a second former federal health official, who resigned at the end of February.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not answer specific written questions about how he had been briefed or his communications with CDC staff.",
      "The spokesperson said the CDC activated an Atlanta-based response in early February to provide overall guidance on measles testing and vaccination strategy. An on-the-ground team was deployed to West Texas throughout most of March and withdrawn on April 1.",
      "It was a \u201cjoint decision\u201d between state and federal officials to send the team home, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. Another team of seven was dispatched back to the region this week.",
      "In previous administrations, health secretaries held weekly briefings with CDC staff, lasting between 25 and 30 minutes, during infectious disease outbreaks, both former HHS officials said. Kennedy, instead, received updates on paper or through email, Griffis said.",
      "\u201cThat is extremely unusual,\u201d said Griffis, who sat in on such briefings with the previous health secretary and said that none were held for Kennedy during his first month on the job. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d",
      "In another irregularity, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the nation's largest network of pediatricians, has not been tapped to work with the CDC on the outbreak, according to the organization's officials. Historically, the CDC and AAP have convened for monthly or biweekly briefings during outbreaks to share updates, which include details about what doctors are seeing and questions they're fielding from parents in exam rooms. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the health department's response.",
      "The only updates provided widely to pediatricians by the CDC have come from a health alert network update sent on March 7, a week after the first U.S. measles death in a decade, and the letter sent to providers last week, which, according to the pediatric academy officials, was late in the outbreak.",
      "Kennedy praised the CDC on Tuesday during an event in Indianapolis, saying it \u201chad done a very good job controlling the measles outbreak.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's inconsistent and unclear message on the measles vaccines has also made the outbreaks difficult to contain, experts say.",
      "He has occasionally endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as \u201ceffective,\u201d but also continues to raise safety concerns about the shots in other statements. In a CBS interview last week, he claimed the vaccines were \u201cnot safety tested.\u201d",
      "That approach has been the biggest flaw of the government's response, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, the president of the Infectious Disease Society of America.",
      "\u201cImagine if the captain of the Titanic had told you that you need to be careful about lifeboats and think about other opportunities,\u201d del Rio said.",
      "Trials were conducted on thousands of children before the vaccine was approved for use in the 1960s. The federal government has since used medical records to continue to monitor for side effects from use in millions of people since.",
      "Health secretaries have typically delivered a clear message urging the public to get vaccinated during outbreaks, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, a former deputy director at the CDC who retired after 33 years at the agency in 2021.",
      "President Donald Trump and his first-term health secretary, Alex Azar, urged people to get shots during news conferences in 2019, when measles ripped through Brooklyn and infected more than 1,200 nationwide.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need the secretary of health to attend a funeral, OK, but you don\u2019t want to have mixed messages on vaccines,\u201d Schuchat said. \u201cSomeone in a federal building in Washington can do a lot of harm from the way that they are messaging.\u201d",
      "Local leaders have largely been left alone to urge the public to take up vaccinations.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has not urged the public to get vaccinated, either. He has not held any news conferences about the outbreak and posted just once on social media about measles since January. Any statements about the illnesses, which have also put 56 people in the hospital at some point, have been left to his aides.",

      "Those types of statements are important for the public to hear leaders say from the top down, said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, who was New York City's health commissioner during the 2019 measles outbreak.",
      "Barbot worked with local rabbis, as well as doctors and nurses in the Jewish community, to send messages that encouraged vaccine uptake. Calls from Trump and Azar, who urged the public to vaccinate, helped her make the case, too.",
      "When national leaders distance themselves from that message, she said it \u201cstarts to erode the effectiveness of people who are trying to convey those messages at the local level.\u201d",

      "Bedtime routines aren\u2019t just for toddlers",
      "Navigating bedtime with a teenager is, in many homes, a nightly battle with a constant refrain: Get off your phone! Go to bed!",
      "Research shows that today\u2019s teenagers are more sleep-deprived than ever before. Adolescents need between eight and 10 hours of sleep, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But nearly 80% of American teenagers aren\u2019t getting that, and experts say it's affecting important areas like mental health and school attendance.",
      "Bedtime routines aren\u2019t just for toddlers. Teenagers need them too, says Denise Pope, an expert on child development and a senior lecturer at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Education.",
      "Experts in adolescent sleep say a few small changes to how parents and teens approach sleep can make a dramatic difference.",
      "The first step to setting up a better bedtime routine is dealing with technology.",
      "\u2014 Separate children from their devices at night. Phones, tablets, streaming services and video games aren\u2019t the only things keeping kids up at night, but experts agree they are a major factor in delaying sleep.",
      "\u201cGet the temptation out of the bedroom,\u201d Pope says. If the phone is within arm\u2019s reach, it\u2019s hard to ignore when notifications buzz. Many teens say they fall asleep while scrolling, or reach for their phone if they have trouble sleeping, and end up scrolling for hours.",
      "\u2014 Be prepared for excuses. \u201cMy phone is my alarm clock\u201d is something a lot of parents hear. The solution: Buy an alarm clock.",
      "\u2014 Put screens away an hour before bedtime. Exposure to light prevents the release of melatonin, the hormone released by the brain that makes us feel drowsy.",
      "Then, replace screens with a new wind-down routine.",
      "\u2014 Try to get to bed around the same time each night and start winding down at least 30 minutes before. During that time, silence notifications, take a warm shower, read a book. To get an idea of what your teen's bedtime should be, try an online \u201c bedtime calculator,\" such as the one from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.",
      "\u2014 Avoid caffeine and energy drinks in the afternoon and evening.",
      "\u2014 The best sleep environment is a cool, dark, quiet room. In noisy households, earplugs and a sleep mask can help. If a bedroom is too warm, it can affect getting to sleep and staying asleep, says adolescent sleep expert Kyla Wahlstrom.",
      "Some of the telltale evidence of sleep deprivation: being irritable, grumpy, short-tempered, emotionally fragile, unmotivated, impulsive and more likely to see the world and oneself through a negative lens. A sleep-deprived teen also may fall asleep during the daytime, in the car or in class.",
      "\u201cWe often blame adolescents for being lazy or unruly or having bad behavior, much of which could be attributed to the fact that they are chronically sleep-deprived,\u201d says Wendy Troxel, a clinical psychologist who has conducted numerous studies on adolescent sleep.",
      "How do you tell the difference between a sleepy teen and a cranky-but-well-rested one?",
      "\u2014 One key sign is what sleep expert Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse calls \u201czombie mornings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf your teen hits snooze five times, takes forever to get out of bed, asks you for a big cup of coffee first thing in the morning, most likely they are running on empty,\" says Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh.",
      "\u2014 Extreme mood swings are another sign. Sleep is critical for emotional processing, which is why sleep-deprived teens are more likely to be irritable, anxious or depressed.",
      "\u2014 A sleep-deprived teen may fall behind in school, because sleep is essential for learning and memory consolidation.",
      "\u2014 Teens who sleep less are more likely to make bad choices when it comes to drug or alcohol use, drowsy or reckless driving and risky sexual behavior.",
      "\u2014 Does your teen sleep until lunchtime on weekends? \"Most likely they are not getting enough sleep during the week,\u201d says Fong-Isariyawongse. It\u2019s fine to sleep in a bit, but try to limit it to a couple hours. Otherwise, it throws off the body clock and makes it harder to wake up when the new school week begins.",
      "Explain to your teens why sleep matters, and that it\u2019s not just nagging parents who say so. The data on mental health and sleep is vast.",
      "\u2014 Many studies show that depression, anxiety and the risk of suicidal thinking go up as sleep goes down.",
      "\u2014 Beyond mood, sleep deprivation affects physical and athletic ability. That\u2019s why several NFL and NBA teams have hired sleep coaches. Teens who are sleep-deprived sustain more physical injuries, because they take more risks, their judgment is impaired, and reflexes and reaction times are not as fast. Teens who get more sleep perform better in sports, and when they do get injuries, they have a quicker recovery time.",
      "\u2014 More teenage car accidents come from drowsy driving than driving under the influence of alcohol, studies show. Teens who say they get less than eight hours of sleep a night are more likely to text while driving, not wear a seat belt, drink and drive \u2014 or get in a car with a driver who has been drinking.",
      "As any parent knows, telling their teenager to go to sleep does not always work. You need to get their buy-in.",
      "\u201cKids need to be educated about sleep, and their brain health and emotional health, and how it all ties together,\u201d says Wahlstrom. \u201cTell your kids, \u2018You\u2019ll do better in school, better in sports, you\u2019ll look better after a good night\u2019s sleep.\u2019 Because until they want to help themselves, they won\u2019t do it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The White House has put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by the news agencies that serve media outlets around the world",
      "Fresh from a courtroom loss over The Associated Press' access to the presidency, the White House on Tuesday put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by news agencies that serve media outlets around the world. It was the latest attempt by the new administration to control coverage of its activities.",
      "The move would block the AP and other wire services that serve billions of readers through thousands of news outlets. It comes after a judge ruled the White House had violated the organization\u2019s free speech by banning it because it disagreed with the outlet\u2019s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "While outlining a new \u201cpool coverage\u201d policy for small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, the White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss, according to people who have seen the plan.",
      "The White House did not return messages for comment on Tuesday evening.",
      "A federal judge last week ruled the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico by blocking its reporters and photographers from covering the events. U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the administration to treat the AP as it does other news organizations.",
      "A day after defying McFadden's ruling and continuing AP's ban when Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele met with reporters in the Oval Office, the White House leaked a new policy to selected journalists.",
      "For many years, the White House Correspondents Association has run the pool for the limited space events, and each time it has included reporters from the wire services AP, Reuters and Bloomberg. One print reporter was also allowed, selected on a rotating basis from more than 30 news outlets.",
      "The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots \u2014 meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used in multiple locations around the country and the planet.",
      "Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump's press secretary \u201cshall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.\u201d The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in \u201cirrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the AP's Lauren Easton said the outlet was deeply disappointed that rather than restore the AP's access, the White House instead chose restrictions over all of the wire services.",
      "\u201cThe wire services represent thousands of news organizations across the U.S. and the world over,\u201d said Easton, an AP spokeswoman. \"Our coverage is used by local newspapers and television stations in all 50 states to inform their communities.",
      "\u201cThe administration's actions continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation,\u201d Easton said Tuesday night.",
      "The independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the administration\u2019s insistence on retaining control over who covers the president shows that it is unwilling to guarantee that it would not continue \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government should not be able to control the independent media that covers it,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, the association\u2019s president.",
      "Under Leavitt, the White House has given greater access to news outlets friendly to Trump. That was visible Tuesday, when the first reporter Leavitt addressed during a briefing asked two questions while also praising Trump policy.",
      "At Monday's Oval Office meeting, Trump bristled at questions from CNN's Kaitlan Collins about a man deported to an El Salvador prison, at one point accusing CNN of \u201chating our country.\u201d He made it a point to contrast her questions with a non-pointed one from another reporter.",
      "Despite the occasional fireworks, Trump has made himself accessible to the media more than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Cramped-quarters events, particularly in the Oval Office, are some of his favorite places to talk \u2014 rendering the new access policy all the more impactful.",
      "The new policy advanced on Tuesday did not address access for photographers. At an earlier court hearing about the AP's case, the outlet's chief White House photographer, Evan Vucci, and correspondent Zeke Miller testified about how the ban has hurt the business of a news agency built to quickly get news and images to its customers.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. McFadden agreed with AP's argument that the government cannot punish the news organization for what it says \u2014 for exercising its right to free speech.",
      "The White House has argued that press access to the president is a privilege, not a right, that it should control \u2014 much like it decides to whom Trump gives one-on-one interviews. In court papers filed last weekend, his lawyers signaled that even with McFadden's decision, the AP's days of unchallenged access to open presidential events were over.",
      "\u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d",
      "The administration has appealed McFadden's ruling, and is scheduled to be in an appeals court on Thursday to argue that ruling should be put on hold until the merits of the case are fully decided, perhaps by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The administration has not curtailed AP access to Leavitt's briefings over the past two months. It has blocked access to events in the East Room to White House-credentialed AP reporters \u2014 until Tuesday, when one was allowed into an event that involved the Navy football team.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Rancher Brett Kenzy hopes President Donald Trump's tariffs will make imported beef expensive enough that Americans will turn to cattle raised at home for all their hamburgers and steaks.",
      "That might raise prices enough to give Kenzy and others the incentive they need to expand their herds for the first time in decades. But doing that would take at least two years, and it's not clear if Trump's tariffs on most of the world besides China are high enough to make that worth the investment.",
      "\u201cIf we can just fix a few key things, I think that we can reinvigorate rural America,\u201d said the South Dakota rancher. \u201cJust get these imports under control, get them to a level that we can understand and plan on, and then let us fill the void. And I think that the American rancher can do that.\u201d",
      "Trump has enjoyed overwhelming support in rural parts of the country in his three campaigns for president. Still, the uncertainty created by the trade war he instigated has given some ranchers pause as they've watched cattle prices drop after the tariffs were announced.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t like manipulated markets because somebody is going to artificially win and somebody is going to artificially lose,\u201d said Bryant Kagay, who raises and feeds cattle as well as growing crops on his farm in northwest Missouri. \u201cAnd how do I know it\u2019s not going to be me?\u201d",
      "Ranchers hope the tariffs might create an incentive for them to raise more cattle, and the National Cattlemen trade group is salivating at the idea of selling more cuts of meat overseas if the tariffs lead to new trade deals with countries that don't buy much U.S. beef.",
      "That's a big if \u2014 Trump has said dozens of countries have reached out to negotiate new trade deals, but no agreements have been reached.",
      "About the only thing clear so far is that American ranchers will likely lose one of their biggest markets as a result of the 125% tariffs imposed by China in response to Trump. They sold $1.6 billion worth of beef there last year, and since many ranchers also raise crops, they are reeling about the prospect of losing China as a market for those, too.",
      "Most beef exports to China are already on hold because the certificates from that country that meat plants need weren't renewed at most beef plants in the United States after they expired in March. So the U.S. Meat Export Federation said few American beef plants are even eligible to ship to China right now.",
      "Kenzy hopes Trump's tariffs represent a lasting change in U.S. trade policy. So far the tariffs have been changing so much since they were announced that ranchers can\u2019t count on them yet.",
      "\u201cIf this is just a short-term negotiating tactic \u2014 Tarzan beating his chest \u2014 then I would say that that would be an epic failure because that will not result in reshoring industry,\u201d Kenzy said.",
      "The problem, as Kenzy and other members of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America see it, is that the more than 4 billion pounds of beef that's imported every year \u2014 along with cattle brought in from other countries to be slaughtered here \u2014 keeps cattle prices lower.",
      "Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced here in the United States to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want. Even though Trump placed most of his proposed tariffs on hold, the across-the-board 10% tariffs he imposed for 90 days will make imported beef more expensive, so consumers are likely to see the price of hamburger increase.",
      "Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. That means meat processors will likely pay higher prices for that imported beef for at least that long. And the ongoing drought across most of the West will continue to make it difficult to raise more cattle.",
      "Plus, if American ranchers want to produce more of that lean beef they might have to change the way they raise their animals because the entire system in this country is designed to produce fattier meat to get deliciously marbled and tender steaks that help ranchers make the most money. Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said most of the lean beef America buys comes from Australia and New Zealand where cattle are fed grass \u2014 not grain \u2014 their entire lives, and that's an entirely different system.",
      "The number of cattle being raised across the country has been shrinking for decades to reach the current historic lows of around 28 million, but Texas A&M livestock economist David Anderson said even though that's less than two-thirds of the number of cattle there were in 1975, more beef \u2014 some 26.7 billion pounds \u2014 was actually produced last year. That's because the American beef industry has become so good at feeding cattle and breeding larger animals that now every head of cattle produces more meat. Anderson said that means there's less incentive to expand the herd.",
      "Casey Maher, owner of the Maher Angus Ranch in Morristown, S.D., said he hopes Trump\u2019s tariffs will level the playing field for American beef producers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic and we\u2019re going to stay the course,\u201d said Maher, a third-generation rancher. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through tough times, and if it\u2019s for the greater good, I think ranchers are all in.\u201d",
      "Not all of them, though. Kagay, the Missouri farmer, said uncertainty causes problems of its own.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not real confident about these tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they stick around? Will they not stick around? Can I count on them? What exactly is going to happen? You know, nobody knows. So it makes it hard for me to plan my business. I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d",
      "That uncertainty could extend well beyond farming and ranching if it creates new fears about the economy as a whole. If consumers buy less beef because they are worried about their grocery budgets, it won't matter how much beef is imported.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re less likely to pay up for a ribeye steak if you\u2019re worried about losing your job,\u201d Tonsor said.",

      "Former President Joe Biden is returning to the national stage to help elevate concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is threatening the health of Social Security",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former President Joe Biden returns to the national stage Tuesday to elevate liberal concerns that President Donald Trump's agenda is threatening the health of Social Security.",
      "The 82-year-old Democrat has largely avoided speaking publicly since leaving the White House in January. That's even as Trump frequently blames Biden for many of the nation's problems, often attacking his predecessor by name.",
      "Biden is expected to fight back in an early evening speech to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago. While Biden has made a handful of public appearances in recent weeks, Tuesday's high-profile address focuses on a critical issue for tens of millions of Americans that could define next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cAs bipartisan leaders have long agreed, Americans who retire after paying into Social Security their whole lives deserve the vital support and caring services they receive,\u201d said Rachel Buck, executive director of the ACRD. \u201cWe are thrilled the president will be joining us to discuss how we can work together for a stable and successful future for Social Security.\u201d",
      "Trump almost immediately began slashing the government workforce upon his return to the White House, including thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Along with a planned layoff of 7,000 workers and controversial plans to impose tighter identity-proofing measures for recipients, the SSA has been sued over a decision to allow Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access individuals\u2019 Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information.",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and one of Trump\u2019s most influential advisers, has called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Social Security recipients have complained about long call wait times as the agency\u2019s \u201cmy Social Security\u201d benefits portal has seen an increase in outages. Individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income, including disabled seniors and low-income adults and children, also reported receiving a notice that said they were \u201cnot receiving benefits.\u201d",
      "The agency said the notice was a mistake. And the White House has vowed that it would not cut Social Security benefits, saying any changes are intended to reduce waste and fraud.",
      "Biden will be joined in Chicago by a bipartisan group of former elected officials, including former Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and former Social Security Administrator Martin O\u2019Malley.",
      "\u201cSocial Security is a sacred promise between generations,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \"We are deeply grateful to the President for joining us at ACRD to discuss how we can keep that promise for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Biden is not expected to make frequent public appearances as he transitions into his post-presidency. He still maintains an office in Washington, but has returned to Delaware as his regular home base. Trump has revoked his security clearances.",
      "While Biden may be in position to help his party with fundraising and messaging, he left the White House with weak approval ratings. Biden also faces blame from some progressives who argue he shouldn't have sought a second term. Biden ended his reelection bid after his disastrous debate performance against Trump and made way for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in the fall.",
      "Just 39% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden in January, according to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Views of the Democratic former president were essentially unchanged from a Gallup poll taken shortly after the November election. They broadly track with the steadily low favorability ratings that Biden experienced throughout the second half of his presidential term.",

      "Lawyers for the driver charged with killing NHL hockey player Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, are expected to argue in court Tuesday that the brothers contributed to the fatal crash by cycling while impaired.",
      "According to the defense, the Gaudreaus had blood-alcohol levels of .129 or above, higher than the .08 legal limit in New Jersey and the .087 that police recorded for Sean Higgins. They hope to have the manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges reduced or dismissed.",
      "However, Salem County prosecutors note that there is no law banning cycling while intoxicated in New Jersey, and that witnesses said the brothers were riding single-file on the edge of the rural road, not weaving into traffic. Prosecutors have accused Higgins of being impaired by alcohol and fueled by road rage when he ran into them.",
      "\u201cThere are four witnesses that witnessed the defendant speeding and illegally passing the Bronco on the right when he struck the brothers. The witnesses also saw the brothers riding single file, with the flow of traffic, on the fog line just prior to being struck by the defendant,\u201d Assistant Prosecutor Michael Mestern wrote this month in asking the judge to exclude the defense\u2019s \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d theory at trial.",
      "He said there was \u201cno credible argument\u201d that would make the cyclists' intoxication levels relevant.",
      "The Gaudreaus were bicycling near their hometown in southern New Jersey on the eve of their sister\u2019s wedding on Aug. 29. Both of their wives have since given birth to sons. Johnny Gaudreau's widow, Meredith, gave birth to their third child on April 1. The sister's wedding was postponed until this summer.",
      "Johnny Gaudreau, known as \u201cJohnny Hockey,\u201d played 10 full seasons in the NHL and was set to start his third with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He played his first eight seasons with the Calgary Flames.",
      "Higgins, 44, of nearby Woodstown, New Jersey, is charged with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and reckless vehicular homicide, along with evidence tampering and leaving the scene of an accident. He was found beside his damaged vehicle about a quarter mile from the scene.",
      "A combat veteran and married father of two who worked for an addiction treatment company, he told police he had consumed about a half-dozen beers that day, some while driving, after an upsetting phone call with his mother.",
      "He faces a maximum 70 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His lawyers have rejected a plea offer of 35 years, arguing that defendants in comparable cases received far less time. The defense also wants to review the laboratory testing methods.",
      "\u201cMr. Higgins is not demanding to be treated differently than any other but rather is respectfully requesting that the presentation of the charges against him be full, complete and transparent,\" defense lawyer Matthew Portella wrote in a motion to dismiss the indictment.",
      "The hearing is set to take place before Superior Court Judge Michael Silvanio. It's not clear if he will rule from the bench.",

    "story": [
      "Jury selection is set to begin Tuesday in Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- The last time a New York City jury sat in judgment of Harvey Weinstein, the ex-movie studio boss was convicted of rape and sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "Five years later, that landmark #MeToo verdict is gone \u2014 wiped away on appeal \u2014 and Weinstein is set to go on trial again, beginning Tuesday with jury selection.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned Weinstein\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that his original one in 2020 was tainted by improper rulings and prejudicial testimony. That ruling gave Weinstein a second chance to fight the charges, and do so in a different atmosphere than his first trial, which was held in the middle of a global reckoning over sexual misconduct.",
      "Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone, is older and more frail, in and out of the hospital regularly for a variety of health problems. He's now far removed from the time when he was among the most powerful men in the movie business.",
      "And even if he is acquitted, he will not walk free.",
      "Weinstein is also appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, though his lawyers said he needs to be resentenced because the since-vacated New York conviction was a factor in how his punishment was calculated.",
      "In the New York retrial, Judge Curtis Farber has set aside at least four days for jury selection and expects opening statements and the start of testimony next week.",
      "The judge, prosecution and defense will work to whittle a massive pool of potential jurors down to the 18 people \u2014 12 jurors and six alternates \u2014 needed for the trial by asking questions and seeking to eliminate anyone they feel can\u2019t judge the case fairly.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on two charges from his original trial. He is accused of raping an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performing a criminal sex act by forcing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006. He is also charged with one count of criminal sex act based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the original trial. That woman, who has not been named publicly, alleges Weinstein forced oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Selecting a jury will involve bringing in around 80 potential jurors at a time for two basic screening questions.",
      "First, the judge will ask for a show of hands from anyone who has work, family or other obligations that will prevent them from serving. Then, he\u2019ll ask for a show of hands from anyone who feels they can\u2019t be impartial based on the nature of the charges or news coverage.",
      "Anyone who raises a hand will be sent home, Farber has said.",
      "Those who remain will be seated in or near the jury box, 24 at a time, and asked additional questions about things like their education, work, and whether anyone they know is in law enforcement or has been a victim of a crime.",
      "Prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers will then each have 40 minutes to ask questions to each subset of 24 potential jurors. Often, lawyers will use that time to follow up on things raised in earlier questioning or to zero in on concerns about potential biases.",
      "Either side can ask the judge to dismiss a potential juror. If too many jurors are dismissed, another group will be brought in and the process will repeat until the full jury is seated.",

      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political groups are preparing for the possibility that President Donald Trump\u2019s allies may soon launch criminal investigations that could handicap Democratic infrastructure",
      "NEW YORK -- As President Donald Trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party's core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "The Democrats' dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party's largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump's top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution.",
      "Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now.",
      "\u201cEvery one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,\" said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target.",
      "An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has (not) broken the law should not be worried,\" Leavitt told The Associated Press. \"If you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it.",
      "Trump's allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in New York. There's no evidence former President Joe Biden influenced the Trump prosecutions in any way.",
      "Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove.",
      "\u201cSomeone needs to get burned for all this activity or they\u2019re just gonna do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hypocrisy; that\u2019s justice.\u201d",
      "Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries.",
      "During a norm-breaking speech at the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country\u2019s \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty.",
      "Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group\u2019s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country.",
      "This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country.",
      "Trump top adviser and billionaire Elon Musk has publicly condemned Indivisible as \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. Indivisible\u2019s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property.",
      "No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it\u2019s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThey may try to come at us directly, or it\u2019s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd that is a risk in a moment where you\u2019re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won\u2019t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?\u201d",
      "Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cI think the FBI\u2019s going to do something on ActBlue soon,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin.",
      "ActBlue officials this week told the AP that they would continue to cooperate with a congressional investigation led by House Republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. ActBlue is preparing a second batch of documents to comply with a new request by House Republicans. Additionally, two ActBlue staffers are expected to testify before a House panel behind closed doors later this month.",
      "Multiple House Republicans in recent weeks have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to \u201cterror-linked organizations.\u201d Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to \u201cto skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws\u201d by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIt must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,\u201d Biggs wrote.",
      "ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of \u201cmany different attacks on various fronts,\u201d including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before.",
      "Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue's two-decade history.",
      "While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that's funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation.",
      "\u201cThese unfounded attacks haven\u2019t shaken us \u2014 they\u2019ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,\" ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. \"As our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.\u201d",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the AP on First- and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

      "New York Helicopter Tours' sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and plunged into the Hudson River Thursday, killing five tourists from Spain and the pilot.",
      "Rocheleau said the agency also began a comprehensive review of the company\u2019s operations. The review is designed to determine whether an operator complies with regulations and effectively manages safety, and identifies hazards and risks.",
      "The victims included passengers Agustin Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal, 39, and their three children, Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10. The pilot was Seankese Johnson, 36, a U.S. Navy veteran who received his commercial pilot\u2019s license in 2023.

      "The company's director of operations, Jason Costello, agreed on Sunday to voluntarily halt flights while the crash was being investigated.

      "BEL AIR, Md. -- A fugitive from El Salvador was convicted Monday in the 2023 slaying of a Maryland woman who was attacked while exercising on a popular hiking trail northeast of Baltimore.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 24, was carrying out a planned attack when he grabbed Rachel Morin off the trail, bashed her head against nearby rocks, raped her and concealed her body in a drainage culvert. Their case hinged on DNA evidence connecting him to the crime.",
      "A jury found Martinez-Hernandez guilty of first-degree murder and first-degree rape, among other offenses, according to Randolph Rice, an attorney representing Morin\u2019s relatives.",
      "\u201cThe Morin family is incredibly relieved that justice was served today,\u201d Rice said in a statement.",
      "Martinez-Hernandez was accused of entering the United States illegally after allegedly killing another woman in his home country. Authorities also linked him to a 2023 home invasion in Los Angeles.",
      "Morin was killed in August 2023. The act of violence sent shock waves through Bel Air, a suburban community northeast of Baltimore. It also became a political flashpoint during the 2024 presidential election campaign as Donald Trump called for increased border security and mass deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Trump posted on social media about the verdict Monday night, saying Morin\u2019s \u201clife was taken at the hands of a monster who should have NEVER been here in the first place\u201d and blaming the Biden administration for failing to properly secure the border.",
      "Martinez-Hernandez was arrested last summer in Oklahoma. He had been living in Bel Air around the time of Morin\u2019s death, prosecutors said. They said Morin went walking or running along the same route almost every day, usually in the evenings.",
      "Defense attorneys challenged prosecutors' assertion that the crime was a random attack and said police simply got the wrong guy. They also asked jurors to pay close attention to unanswered questions during the trial, including questions of motive.",

      "They remain huddled for several minutes as the older elephants look outward, appearing to be at the ready, their ears spread and flapping \u2014 even after the rocking stopped.",
      "The quake was felt from San Diego to Los Angeles, 120 miles (193 kilometers) away. It sent boulders tumbling onto rural roads in San Diego County and knocked items off store shelves in the tiny mountain town of Julian near the epicenter but caused no injuries or major damage.",
      "But it spooked the elephants.",
      "Once in a circle, \u201cthey sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,\u201d said Mindy Albright, a curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.",
      "Elephants are highly intelligent and social animals that have the ability to feel sound through their feet. When they perceive a threat, they often bunch together in an \u201calert circle,\" typically with the young clustered in the center and the adults facing outward to defend the group.",
      "In the video, one of the calves can be seen running for refuge between the adults, a group of matriarchs that all helped raise her. But the other calf, the only male, remained on the edge of the circle, wanting to show his courage and independence, Albright said. Meanwhile, the female elephant, Khosi, a teenager who helped raise him along with his biological mother, Ndlula, repeatedly tapped him on the back with her trunk, and even on the face, as if patting him to say, \u201cThings are OK,\u201d and \u201cStay back in the circle.\u201d",
      "Zuli is still a baby and is coddled as such, Albright said, but his role will change over the next few years as he becomes a bull and moves to join a bachelor group while the female elephants stay with the family unit for their entire lives.",
      "\u201cIt's so great to see them doing the thing we all should be doing \u2014 that any parent does, which is protect their children,\u201d Albright said.",
      "About an hour later when an aftershock hit, they briefly huddled again and then dispersed once they determined everyone was safe.",

      "The city of St. Louis and the leader of its city council have filed a federal lawsuit against a new Missouri law that puts a state-appointed board in control of the local police department",
      "ST. LOUIS -- The city of St. Louis and the leader of its city council filed a federal lawsuit Monday against a new Missouri law putting a state-appointed board back in control of the local police department, putting St. Louis among a handful of major U.S. cities that don't fully oversee law enforcement.",
      "The president of the city's Board of Aldermen, Megan Green, argues in the lawsuit that the new law violates her rights to free expression, freedom of assembly and to petition state government, all guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The city says the law violates a provision of the Missouri Constitution that prohibits unfunded mandates from the state.",
      "The law, approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe last month, gives the governor the power to appoint four city residents as voting members of a new board to manage the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to serve along with the city's elected mayor, currently Democrat Tishaura Jones. The police department of Kansas City, Missouri, is overseen by such a board.",
      "Some critics suggested that Republican lawmakers wanted to wrest control of the police away from Jones, a Black woman, but Kehoe has said legislators were \u201cprioritizing public safety.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the new law violates Green\u2019s rights through vague and overly broad provisions that prohibit city officials from taking any action to \u201cimpede, obstruct or interfere\u201d with the state board, subjecting them to fines and removal from office. The new law also requires St. Louis to increase its spending on the police department each year through 2028.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is promising to defend the law.",
      "\u201cRather than waste taxpayer funds in an attempt to defund the police, we would encourage city leaders to focus their efforts on building a safer St. Louis,\u201d James Lawson, a deputy chief of staff for Bailey, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "St. Louis first lost full control over its police department during the Civil War in 1861, when Missouri was sharply divided between Union and Confederate supporters. St. Louis and Kansas City had larger Black populations than other parts of the state and were centers of Union support. A pro-Confederate government persuaded the Legislature to give the state control of the local police.",
      "That control lasted until a statewide vote in 2012 decisively approved an amendment to the state constitution to allow St. Louis to take control of the police department. However, Republicans argued this year that it was necessary to return control to the state to restore order in the city following years of population loss, a rise in homicides, and power struggles between city leaders and GOP state officials.",

      "A history scholar convicted of spying on Chinese dissidents by ingratiating himself as a sympathizer has been spared prison time by a U.S. judge",
      "NEW YORK -- A Chinese American scholar convicted of spying on Chinese dissidents was spared prison time Monday by a U.S. judge.",
      "Shujun Wang was sentenced by U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin to time served and three years\u2019 supervised release, according to attorneys. Wang has been free on bail since the day of his arrest.",
      "Wang, 76, was convicted last summer of charges including conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent.",
      "With a story that federal prosecutors have described as akin to a spy novel, the case is part of their portfolio on what Washington views as \" transnational repression \" by authoritarian governments targeting critics abroad. The Chinese government has said it's being slandered by the \u201cmalicious fabrication of the so-called \u2018transnational suppression\u2019 narrative.\"",
      "A Chinese-born American citizen, Wang was a history professor in his homeland. He became a visiting fellow at Columbia University for a time in the 1990s and emigrated to the U.S., where he wrote books and co-founded a pro-democracy group in New York City.",
      "Prosecutors portrayed Wang's advocacy as a facade that garnered him credibility with sincere activists, allowing him to gather information on Hong Kong democracy protesters, supporters of Taiwanese independence, Uyghur and Tibetan activists and others.",
      "He relayed the intel to China\u2019s main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, in the form of emails styled as \u201cdiaries,\" according to prosecutors and trial evidence. The messages concerned demonstrations planned during Chinese President Xi Jinping' s visits to the U.S., anniversary events for the 1989 protests and bloody crackdown in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, and more.",
      "Wang also met with ministry officials on trips to China, according to prosecutors and evidence.",
      "One activist and fellow academic mentioned in the \u201cdiaries,\u201d Ming Xia, told the court in a letter that he\u2019d altered his daily routine as a result. Another activist, Anna Yeung-Cheung, wrote that Wang's \u201cbetrayal not only damaged personal bonds and shattered our collective trust but also exacerbated harmful stereotypes that depict Chinese and Asian Americans as potential spies.\u201d",
      "Another figure in the \u201cdiaries\u201d \u2014 Juntao Wang, an academic and dissident who spent years in prison in China \u2014 said he knew about Shujun Wang's Chinese Communist Party connections but still appreciated his work with the pro-democracy movement.",
      "\u201cFrom the perspective of traditional Chinese political culture and contemporary Chinese politics, his dual identity is a common and understandable phenomenon,\u201d he wrote to the court. Saying that some genuine supporters of democracy also deal with Chinese officials to gain some benefits, he asked for a short sentence for Shujun Wang.",
      "Shujun Wang told FBI agents in interviews that his communiqu\u00e9s were just accounts of publicly available tidbits.",
      "In a New York Times Magazine interview after his conviction, he at times called the diaries a hobby and said he hadn't known his contacts in China worked for the security agency. At other points, he acknowledged sharing information with Chinese officials and said he was just trying to promote democracy to the Communist government, according to the magazine.",
      "Wang\u2019s attorney, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, called Judge Chin's sentence a \u201cwise\u201d decision.",
      "\u201cIt appropriately recognized that his conduct was not driven by any financial motive and did limited, if any harm,\u201d said Margulis-Ohnuma, who also noted that Wang has multiple health problems.",
      "In court papers, Margulis-Ohnuma said the case didn't depict a debonair spy but rather \u201can aging democracy activist \u2014 lonesome and starved for attention, eager to please and always delighted to engage \u2014 who occasionally provided mostly-useless information to the Chinese government and lied about it as he became older, more impaired and more isolated.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in New Hampshire says two dads who oppose allowing transgender athletes to play high school sports won\u2019t be allowed to wear pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to games while their lawsuit against the school district continues",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Two fathers who oppose allowing transgender athletes to play high school sports won't be allowed to wear pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to games while their lawsuit against the school district continues, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote were banned from school grounds in Bow after wearing the wristbands to a soccer game in September that included a transgender girl on the opposing team. They later sued the school district, and while the no-trespass orders have since expired, they asked the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear the wristbands featuring the symbol for female chromosomes at school events while the case proceeds.",
      "Both men testified at a hearing in November that they didn\u2019t intend to harass or otherwise target transgender athlete Parker Tirrell, and their attorneys argued they did nothing more than silently express their support for reserving girls\u2019 sports for those assigned female at birth.",
      "But in denying their motion Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe said the parents' \u201cnarrow, plausibly inoffensive\u201d intentions weren't as important as the wider context, and that adults attending a high school athletic event do not enjoy a First Amendment protected right to convey messages that demean, harass or harm students.",
      "\"While plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at Parker Tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,\" he wrote. \u201cAnd, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.\u201d",
      "School officials described receiving strongly-worded emails from Foote in which he called himself a \u201creal leader\u201d who was prepared to take action and seeing his social media posts urging others to attend the game. In the days leading up to the game, another parent told school officials she overheard others talk about showing up to the game wearing dresses and heckling Tirrell.",
      "\u201cThis was organized and targeted,\u201d Superintendent Marcy Kelley said.",
      "Brian Cullen, an attorney for the school district, said Monday he was pleased with what he called a well-reasoned ruling that affirms that school districts can and should protect students from harassment from adults on school grounds. And he noted that the ruling doesn't prevent the plaintiffs from expressing their views in other ways.",
      "\u201cIt simply prevents them from bringing their protest to the sidelines of a game being played by kids. That should not be a controversial limitation,\u201d he said.",
      "Del Kolde, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he strongly disagrees with the ruling.",
      "\u201cThis was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,\u201d said Kolde, senior attorney for the Institute for Free Speech. \u201cBow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be \u2018trans-exclusionary.'\u201d",
      "After the ruling was issued, the plaintiffs filed a notice saying they do not intend to enter more evidence before the judge makes a final decision.",
      "Meanwhile, Tirrell and another student athlete are challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes  in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity, as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s Feb. 5 executive order, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d A federal judge ruled in their case that they can play sports during the ongoing lawsuit that seeks to overturn the law.",

      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied Washington state's request for emergency relief funds to help repair an estimated $34 million in damage from a deadly bomb cyclone storm system in November, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "Ferguson said in a news release on Monday that the state\u2019s January application for assistance was denied in a letter he received on Friday. The state's application had met all of the criteria necessary to qualify, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding,\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, said. \"Washington communities have been waiting for months for the resources they need to fully recover from last winter\u2019s devastating storms, and this decision will cause further delay. We will appeal.\u201d",
      "The November storm system battered the state with strong winds and rain that caused widespread damage and power outages, and toppled trees that killed at least two people. It was considered a \u201c bomb cyclone,\u201d which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. Bomb cyclones have been associated with major weather events across the country including hurricanes in recent years.",
      "After Washington's storms, then-Gov. Jay Inslee issued a disaster declaration in 11 counties \u2014 including where Seattle is located \u2014 and filed the application for disaster relief with FEMA to repair damage to public highways, public utilities and electrical power systems.",
      "FEMA's letter denying the application didn't give an explanation and said the assistance was \u201cnot warranted.\u201d The state has 30 days to appeal.",
      "The denial comes as FEMA's future is in question. President Donald Trump has questioned whether to disband it entirely and give money directly to states to handle disasters. Trump has created a council to study what to do with FEMA and whether to get rid of it.",
      "Earlier this month FEMA said it was ending a key program that has been used by communities across the country to pay for projects designed to help them prepare for natural disasters like flooding and fires.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the agency was instrumental in responding to a growing number of disasters linked to climate change. The agency also tried to address historical inequalities in how aid is dispersed after disasters.",
      "FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond the state\u2019s ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap financial assistance to individual residents.",
      "Washington\u2019s preliminary damage estimate of $34 million will likely increase as the state works with counties to update their information for an appeal, Ferguson said.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- More than 300 civilians were killed in two days of intense fighting in Sudan\u2019s conflict-wracked Darfur region, the U.N. humanitarian agency reported Monday, as the African country's brutal civil war nears the two-year mark.",
      "The attacks launched by Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group on two famine-hit camps for displaced people in North Darfur and its nearby capital on Friday and Saturday were initially reported to have left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to a U.N. official.",
      "But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, reported the much higher death toll Monday, citing local sources that were not identified. The Associated Press could not independently verify the numbers due to the conditions and communications on the ground.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Since then, at least 24,000 people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.",
      "The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, known as the RSF, carried out the recent attacks after the Sudanese military late last month regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war.",
      "The war has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis and worst displacement crisis, and it has led to Sudan becoming the only country in the world experiencing famine.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said OCHA has received reports of mass casualties and large-scale displacement following the recent fighting in and around the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk displacement camps, as well as North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher, the only capital in Darfur that the RSF doesn\u2019t control. North Darfur is one of five states in the Darfur region.",
      "\u201cPreliminary figures from local sources indicate that more than 300 civilians have been killed, including 10 humanitarian personnel from the NGO Relief International who lost their lives while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp,\u201d Dujarric said.",
      "The escalation in the fighting came ahead of a conference in London to spotlight the war's anniversary on Tuesday organized by Britain, the European Union, Germany and France, where more than 20 foreign ministers are expected along with representatives of global organizations.",
      "Dujarric said the United Nations wants the conference to see Sudan\u2019s \u201cneighbors and the international community move in unity of purpose towards peace instead of fueling the conflict.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council has scheduled emergency closed consultations on Sudan.",
      "The U.N. migration agency said Monday the RSF attacks in Zamzam camp have displaced between 60,000 to 80,000 families in the past two days. The majority of the families remain within El Fasher, which is under military control but has been besieged by the RSF for over a year.",
      "Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N. refugee office\u2019s regional director, said in a video press conference with U.N. correspondents that \u201cmassive violations of human rights\u201d have forced almost 13 million Sudanese to flee their homes, including 4 million who fled to other countries. Most fled to Sudan's immediate neighbors, but more than 200,000 have gone to Libya and about 70,000 to Uganda, he said.",
      "Balde said the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s appeal for $1.8 billion to help the millions of refugees and their host nations is only 10% funded. He warned that if it doesn\u2019t get more money, people will move toward southern Africa, east Africa, the Gulf countries and Europe.",
      "\u201cWe really hope that tomorrow\u2019s event in London will also show greater support for the Sudanese brothers and sisters who have been displaced,\u201d Balde said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget has proposed gutting the State Department\u2019s budget by almost 50%, closing a number of overseas diplomatic missions, slashing the number of diplomatic staff, and eliminating funding for nearly all international organizations, including the United Nations, many of its agencies and for NATO headquarters, officials said.",
      "The proposal, which was presented to the State Department last week and is still in a highly preliminary phase, is not expected to pass muster with either the department\u2019s leadership or Congress, which will ultimately be asked to vote on the entire federal budget in the coming months.",
      "Officials familiar with the proposal say it must still go through several rounds of review before it even gets to lawmakers, who in the past have amended and even rejected White House budget requests. Though the proposal is preliminary, it gives an indication of the Trump administration's priorities and coincides with massive job and funding cuts across the federal government, from Health and Human Services and the Education Department to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Notes from an internal meeting about the proposal have been circulated in online chat groups among foreign service officers since the weekend but exploded Monday when the State Department was due to present a separate unrelated reorganization plan to the OMB.",
      "One senior U.S. official familiar with the OMB proposal called it \u201caggressive\u201d in terms of cost-cutting, but also stressed that it was an early outline that mirrored what OMB chief Russell Vought sought to do in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration when he served in the same job. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.",
      "So did two people familiar with the matter who confirmed the proposal, one of whom also said it originated from OMB.",
      "OMB spokesperson Alexandra McCandless said that \u201cno final funding decisions have been made.\u201d The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts.",
      "OMB\u2019s efforts to severely reduce the State Department\u2019s budget during Trump\u2019s first term were met with fierce resistance on Capitol Hill and largely failed.",
      "However, Trump\u2019s second administration has moved swiftly to scale back the federal government, slashing jobs and funding across agencies. It's already dismantled USAID and moved to defund so-called other \u201csoft power\u201d institutions of foreign policy importance like the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Radio Free Asia and Radio/TV Marti, which broadcasts to Cuba.",
      "Thus, State Department officials and others have expressed increasing concern about the possibility that the proposed drastic cuts could actually be implemented.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the proposed cuts.",
      "\u201cWhen America First becomes America Alone, our economy, security and prosperity will suffer as adversaries fill the void the Trump Administration leaves behind,\" Shaheen said in a statement. \u201cInvestments in diplomatic programs that promote peace and stability, and advance American national security interests are commonsense priorities that should be reflected in the State Department\u2019s budget request.\u201d",
      "According to the notes from the internal State Department meeting, the budget proposal calls for:",
      "\u2014 Halving foreign assistance funding managed by State and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which stood at $52 billion in 2024.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating more than a quarter of foreign assistance through State and USAID overall, freeze pay through next year, and cut travel and benefits for U.S. foreign service staffers.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating global health funding other than small amounts for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Require global health partners to contribute a bigger share.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating funding to the United Nations, a major logistical partner key to many humanitarian efforts around the world, and other major nongovernment organizations, including NATO.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating the main office helping Afghan allies resettle in other countries to escape Taliban rule.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating the government\u2019s independent watchdog office looking for waste and inefficiency in U.S. programs in Afghanistan.",
      "\u2014 Cutting a number of refugee and immigration programs, and move them under a new bureau for international humanitarian affairs.",

      "The Trump administration has turned a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press away from covering an Oval Office news conference involving President Donald Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele",
      "Despite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with President Donald Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele.",
      "Last week's federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump's request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible.",
      "Later Monday, two AP photographers were admitted to an event honoring Ohio State's championship football team on the more spacious South Lawn. A text reporter was turned away.",
      "Since mid-February, AP reporters and photographers have been blocked from attending events in the Oval Office, where President Donald Trump frequently addresses journalists, and on Air Force One. The AP has seen sporadic access elsewhere, and regularly covers White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s briefings. Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in the AP's lawsuit.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. The AP argued \u2013 and U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden agreed last week \u2013 that the government cannot punish the news organization for exercising its right to free speech.",
      "McFadden on Friday had rejected Trump\u2019s request for more delay in implementing the ruling; now the president is asking an appeals court for the same thing.",
      "\u201cWe expect the White House to restore AP's participation in the (White House press) pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Monday.",
      "The extent of AP's future access remains uncertain, even with the court decision.",
      "Until being blocked by Trump, AP has traditionally always had a reporter and photographer among the small group of journalists invited into the Oval Office. McFadden did not order that to be restored, only that no news organization should be shut out because the president objects to its news decisions \u2014 under a principle called \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued in court papers over the weekend. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- For the first time in over a decade, Chicago\u2019s public school teachers have a new contract without a strike or threat of a walkout. The four-year agreement includes pay hikes, hiring more teachers and class size limits.",
      "While negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district didn\u2019t escalate this time, there was unprecedented turmoil surrounding the unusual yearlong talks. The drama included the school superintendent\u2019s firing, the entire board resigning and historic elections that tested the union\u2019s power.",
      "Now, Chicago faces uncertainty with Trump administration education cuts and looming questions about how the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district will pay for the contract.",
      "While all parties are celebrating the agreement now, there\u2019s been no shortage of turbulence.",
      "Perhaps the main reason negotiations didn\u2019t devolve into a strike, as was the case in 2019 and 2012, was union ally Mayor Brandon Johnson. A former teacher and CTU organizer, the union helped elect him in 2023.",
      "He spent months trying to oust Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez, an appointee of former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in a public spat.",
      "\u201cAll of that chaos and turmoil there clearly dragged down the bargaining and probably shut it down for a fair amount of time,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois professor of labor and employment relations.",
      "Johnson wanted a $300 million high-interest loan to cover the new contract and a pension payment, which Martinez and the board rejected as fiscally irresponsible. In October, the board resigned in protest.",
      "The next month, the city held its first school elections. The transitional board \u2014 a mix of union-backed candidates, charter school supporters and independents \u2014 includes mayoral appointees until it\u2019s fully elected in 2027.",
      "In December, the board moved to fire Martinez, though he\u2019ll remain until June. At one point, Martinez accused new members of meeting privately with the union and won a judge\u2019s restraining order.",
      "The union started contract talks last year with more than 700 requests, a record for the almost 30,000-member union.",
      "Union leaders say their goal is always equality in the segregated city. Roughly 70% of the 325,000 students in the district are low-income and more than 80% are Black or Latino.",
      "But district officials said those lofty requests would have cost over $10 billion. The district\u2019s annual budget is roughly $10 billion.",
      "The new agreement\u2019s price tag is about $1.5 billion.",
      "\u201cWe stayed true to our values,\u201d Martinez said after the deal was announced. \u201cWe succeeded in keeping the best interest of our students always at the center.\"",
      "Both sides touted transparency. For the first time, some bargaining sessions were publicly livestreamed.",
      "It was also the first time in nearly about decades the union was allowed to bargain on issues like class size. In 1995, a Republican-led Illinois legislature passed a law limiting collective bargaining rights largely to pay and benefits. Democratic leaders changed that in 2021.",
      "CTU President Stacy Davis Gates celebrated the contract as a win that protects students, particularly those who are vulnerable under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s big, it\u2019s complex and it is certainly a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson also took a victory lap, trumpeting his union ties.",
      "\u201cWhen I was running for office, they said it would be a liability,\u201d he told reporters recently. \u201cBut it sounds like to me that no other mayor could have brought Chicago Public Schools, the Board of Education, the mayor\u2019s office and the CTU together to the table to make sure that our children get exactly what they deserve, which is a fully funded, well-rounded education.\u201d",
      "Under the deal, teachers will get 4% retroactive raises as the contract expired last year. Then they\u2019ll get 4% or 5% raises each year after.",
      "Starting next year, the median teacher pay will be $98,000. By the contract\u2019s end in 2028, the average teacher will earn around $110,000, according to the district.",
      "The district, which employs roughly 7,000 teachers, will hire 800 more, and nearly 100 additional librarians. Teachers will get an extra 10 minutes of daily prep time, for 70 minutes total.",
      "Also, class sizes will be limited by grade level. For instance, kindergarten will have the smallest and be capped at 25 students.",
      "Union leaders announced Monday that 97% of members who voted approved the deal. Davis Gates called it \u201coverwhelmingly historic levels\u201d of support for a contract that built on previous years' work, including strikes.",
      "Experts say what happened in Chicago could give other unions momentum. Los Angeles teachers, who are currently negotiating, noted CTU in a recent newsletter.",
      "\u201cOrganizing is how we resist political agendas to dismantle our public schools and public services. And we can Win Our Future in Los Angeles, just like our union siblings in Chicago,\u201d the United Teachers Los Angeles newsletter read.",
      "Still, serious funding questions remain.",
      "The district has a roughly $500 million annual deficit and a pending $175 million pension reimbursement to the city. The district is also about to enter contract negotiations with the principals\u2019 union.",
      "Martinez said the first year of the contract is covered, but there\u2019s uncertainty after that.",
      "Where the two sides agree is that the talks took too long.",
      "As Trump took office, union organizers said there was more gravity to their work, even as both sides in the Democratic stronghold are aligned on issues including immigrant rights.",
      "\u201cWe had a sense of urgency, we had a sense of responsibility,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cThe district shared the responsibility, but not the urgency.\u201d",
      "School officials accused the union of taking their time.",
      "\u201cWe should have had this contract months ago,\u201d Martinez said.",

    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",
      "This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.",
      "In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.",
      "Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.",
      "This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.",
      "The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.",
      "However, there is a big problem now.",
      "The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "Nvidia said its $5.5bn charges would be associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves.",

      "Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.",
      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",
      "\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.",
      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",
      "It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.",
      "Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.",
      "Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.",
      "Can Finland compete as Europe\u2019s start-up capital?",
      "The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over \u20ac1bn in funding.",
      "This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.",
      "Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.",

      "Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.",

      "It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.",
      "\"There is an authenticity with the Finns,\" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.",
      "\"Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.\"",
      "Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.",
      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",
      "In 2024 Business Finland alone invested \u20ac112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.",
      "\"The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.\"",
      "The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.",
      "The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.",
      "These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.",
      "\"They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,\" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.",
      "Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.",
      "\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.",
      "But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.",
      "Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.",
      "It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.",

      "\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"",
      "Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.",
      "A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.",
      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ljwgg9y0o",
    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality produce in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Making microchips: the secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

    "summary": "Business Secretary says steel is a 'sensitive sector' after crucial materials arrive at British Steel",
    "story": [
      "The government has admitted it would \"look at a Chinese firm in a different way\" when considering investment in the steel industry after being forced to seize control British Steel.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said steel is a \"sensitive sector\" after key raw materials needed to keep the company's blast furnaces running were being transported to its Scunthorpe plant on Tuesday.",
      "The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off.",
      "Beijing has accused the government of \"politicising trade co-operation\" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK.",
      "The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations.",
      "But Reynolds said when it came to looking for potential investors: \"I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way\".",
      "\"[Steel] is a sensitive sector around the world and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China,\" he added.",
      "After its intervention at the weekend, the government then had to scramble to secure the supplies needed to keep Scunthorpe going.",
      "Coking coal and iron ore from the US arrived at Immingham docks on Tuesday to be transported to British Steel's Scunthorpe site.",
      "Reynolds said he was \"keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest\".",
      "Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of the union Community, said the arrival was a \"huge relief\".",
      "A separate shipment of materials is back on its way to the UK from Australia after a legal dispute over who owned the cargo was resolved between the government and Jingye.",
      "If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly.",
      "Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways.",
      "The materials have been paid for by the government, which industry minister Sarah Jones said are covered by existing budgets.",
      "\"We have a \u00a32.5bn fund for steel within the department for business so we won't be drawing down on any extra resources and people can be reassured of that,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials.",
      "Asked if the government could guarantee there would be no job cuts at the North Lincolnshire steelworks, Reynolds there may be a \"different employment footprint\".",
      "\"That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.\"",
      "British Steel has been granted planning permission to build new \"greener\" electric arc furnaces which unions have claimed would lead to job losses.",
      "Why did the government take control of British Steel?",
      "Ex-Tata workers 'frustrated' by Scunthorpe takeover",
      "'Bad faith'",
      "In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.",
      "Talks between officials and Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough.",
      "The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "\"We were working in good faith on what we thought was a good deal on the table,\" said Jones.",
      "\"That relationship broke down when, in the middle of a consultation about the future of the site, they refused to buy the raw materials to keep that site going. That was an act of bad faith and that's why we had to intervene in the way that we did.\"",
      "Reynolds previously said it \"became clear\" that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting the government to secure control of the site.",

      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "Ministers say they have secured the raw materials needed to keep the plant's blast furnaces working in the \"coming weeks\", while they look for a long-term solution.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",

      "British Steel to get supplies to keep furnaces burning",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",

      "Though the trip was long-planned, it has taken on heightened significance in the wake of a mounting trade war between the US and China. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46% before the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause last week.",
      "US President Donald Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to \"screw the United States of America\".",

      "But Trump later chimed in on social media saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that \"they are just moving to a different tariff 'bucket'\".",

      "However, this is likely to be a considerable underrepresentation of the true scale of Chinese investment in the UK because the official data only includes the immediate investing country, not the ultimate source of the money - and because of a lack of transparency from Beijing when it comes to overseas ownership stakes.",
      "Independent estimates from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, using corporate reports, suggest total public and private Chinese investment in the UK between 2005 and 2024 added up to $105bn, or \u00a382bn.",

      "The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Meta says there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube.",
      "Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr Zuckerberg was the first witness in the case on Monday at a federal court in Washington DC. The trial is expected to last for two months.",
      "The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.\"",
      "The following year, he sent another email saying the company was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up\".",
      "On the stand, Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails \"relatively early\" conversations about buying the app. He added that Meta had improved Instagram over the years.",

      "\"Acquisitions to improve and grow\" have never been found unlawful, Meta's lead litigator, said on Monday, \"and they should not be found unlawful here\".",
      "Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products.",
      "Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025. according to research firm Emarketer.",
      "Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election.",
      "The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.",

      "\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.",
      "\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",

      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",

      "Well, well, well.",
      "In a US customs messaging note quietly slipped out in the early hours of Saturday, a series of numbers were listed as exempt from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.",
      "The code \"8517.13.00.00\" means very little to most of the world, but in the US customs list it represents smartphones.",
      "The inclusion meant the number one Chinese export to America by value last year was exempted from the import taxes, alongside other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards.",
      "In the context of the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just days ago announcing that part of the point of escalating tariffs on China was to bring back iPhone production to the US, this was a stunning about-turn.",
      "The US has now excluded the single biggest Chinese export, and certainly the most high-profile finished good from tariffs, without publicly announcing it at first.",
      "It is worth considering what would have happened in the absence of this exemption.",
      "The effect of 125% tariffs on Apple's Zhengzhou manufacturing facility in eastern China would have started to show in weeks at most American Apple stores. It would have been a totemic \"sticker shock\" for the White House's tumultuous tariff push.",
      "According to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm, as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China.",
      "The tech giant's manufacturing profit margins are estimated to be between 40-60%. Typical iPhone prices might have moved closer to $2,000 (\u00a31,528) than $1,000. The other option for Apple could have been to spread the cost across all of its global prices, but would the rest of the world accept paying a Trump tariff tax?",
      "A very public repricing of iPhones has been avoided, but still may occur if, as the White House has said, the previously imposed 20% tariffs on China related to the powerful opioid fentanyl, remain in place.",
      "Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here. He can walk into a meeting with both US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is not an outlandish prediction to suggest that, if it comes, any peace in the US-China trade war could be brokered by Mr Cook.",
      "That's based on his deep fundamental role in connecting the two economies. He was hand-selected by Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs for his unrivalled expertise in just-in-time supply logistics.",
      "'Art of the Repeal'",
      "This is all moving rather quickly now. Weekend reports in the US press claim White House trade hawk Pete Navarro is being sidelined too, in favour of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Navarro was the author of the infamous equation that set so-called reciprocal tariff rates in proportion to the size of a country's trade surplus with the US, calling it \"the sum of all cheating\".",
      "Bessent is now leading negotiations with trade partners seeking to avoid the reapplication of those rates after the 90-day pause.",
      "There is a big question after 10 days of chaos. What is the incentive for other nations to offer much here? The Trump administration is clearly spooked by the bond market reaction to the president's trade plans, and questions surrounding the safe haven status of US debt for investors.",
      "In trying to stave off effective interest rates on bonds rising to 5%, the US needs deals more than just those in surplus countries.",
      "Indeed this weekend's broad range of exemptions are in and of themselves an astonishing U-turn on the principle embodied in the notorious tariff chart held up by Trump in the Rose Garden.",
      "Just under a quarter of China's total exports are now exempt from the 125% tariff, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The consultancy suggests there are other big winners from the exemptions, with 64% of exports to the US from Taiwan, 44% from Malaysia, and just under 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand now also exempt.",
      "The 10% universal tariff is now riddled with exemptions, and the biggest carve outs are for many nations with massive trade surpluses from electronics manufacturing.",
      "The new tariff equation is to give an effective discount from the universal 10% (through exemptions) to those with the biggest surpluses. For example, Taiwan has a $74bn surplus with the US, and Vietnam a $124bn surplus.",
      "This is the exact opposite of the infamous Navarro calculation from last week. In 10 days we've gone from the \"looters and pillagers\" will be hit the hardest, to (apart from China) those with big surpluses getting the biggest exemptions.",
      "Meanwhile an ally such as the UK, which according to US figures has a $12bn deficit - i.e. the US sells more to the UK than the other way round, has a 25% tariff on cars, its biggest goods exports, with number two, medicines, in line for similar charges.",
      "The White House has gone from clearly suggesting there would be no negotiation on the baseline 10% tariffs to offering exemptions to the very products causing the deficit the entire policy was supposed to solve.",
      "This is a lot more than a \"row back\". Some have called it the \"Art of the Repeal\". The 4D chess has been replaced by someone playing one dimensional checkers, but unable to tell the difference between opposing pieces.",

      "\"You never used to do your shopping nervous,\" the 74-year-old said. \"I feel like you have to buy a lot of things because you don't know what's going to happen.\"",
      "The dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil.",
      "Last week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties.",
      "The disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week.",
      "Analysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway.",
      "If price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending.",
      "Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, is predicting the US economy will grow just 0.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 5% - the highest level since 2021 amid Covid.",
      "Other firms, such as JP Morgan, are forecasting an outright recession.",
      "\"In terms of the consumer, it does get a little tricky,\" Ms Bostjancic said.",
      "\"We could see consumer spending actually be strong in March and April but it's just because of this surge ahead of the tariff increases,\" she added. \"Going forward, consumer spending is going to be weaker.\"",
      "On surveys, fears about both the economy and price rises are flaring, even though hiring has been solid and inflation cooled to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Some people shopping in New York said it felt like a whole way of life could be coming to an end.",
      "Louis Lopez, an elevator mechanic in New York City, said he was so worried about the economy he had started to squirrel away cash under the mattress. But he was also holding shopping bags with new work clothes and a pair of Nike trainers for the summer.",
      "\"You might as well buy it now ... while you have it good,\" the 56-year-old said. \"It's going to change everything for everybody.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",

    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",

      "The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla.",
      "The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.",

      "Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023.",
      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",

      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "The government said the move would \"ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support\".",
      "In an email to stakeholders, seen by the BBC, the Department for Education said the \"difficult decision\" came as demand for the fund \"continues to grow significantly\".",

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",

      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men, Batman and The Departed.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",

      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",
      "But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?",
      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",

      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",
      "Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills.",

      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication.",
      "The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings.",
      "In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue.",
      "Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.",
      "The 'whole field of womanly action'",
      "The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life.",
      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

    "story": [
      "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests.",
      "In 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies that make their own productions - ranging from the National Theatre to the Colchester Mercury - opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%.",
      "Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".",
      "But some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.",
      "Last week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.",
      "\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.",
      "'Serious problem'",
      "Leeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.",
      "\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"",
      "British theatre has \"a serious problem\" with the reduction in opportunities, added Brining, who is about to move from Leeds to run the Edinburgh Lyceum.",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "Many performers and crew start their careers in theatres before going on to work in TV and film, arts education consultant and theatre blogger Carl Woodward said.",
      "\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.",
      "\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"",
      "The theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.",
      "Many venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.",
      "\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.",
      "\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"",
      "However, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.",
      "\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"",
      "In 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.",
      "\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.",
      "\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"",
      "'Less serious drama'",
      "Salisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.",
      "\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.",
      "\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.",
      "\"So there's less misery and risk.\"",
      "Nottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".",
      "\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.",
      "\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"",
      "However, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.",
      "'More with less'",
      "A handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.",
      "Curve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.",
      "\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.",
      "\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.",
      "Annual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.",
      "Last year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".",
      "Performer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.",
      "\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"",
      "The research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week. If a co-production was jointly made by more than one theatre, it was counted as a single production.",
      "The research covered the 40 venues, festivals and touring companies that produce original theatre, were operating in 2014 and 2024, and had the highest annual grants in 2024/25 from the Arts Councils of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Creative Scotland and the Scottish government.",

      "The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood has called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny\".",
      "The British actress said the US comedy programme \"punched down\" on her and suggested the sketch was misogynistic.",
      "In a series of Instagram posts, Wood wrote that she was happy to be made fun of \"when it's clever and in good spirits\" but that there \"must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way\".",
      "Wood, 31, said she had received \"apologies from SNL\" after sharing her criticism. The BBC has contacted broadcaster NBC for a response.",
      "The actress's role in the third series of The White Lotus, which follows a group of guests at a resort, prompted significant media attention surrounding what she calls her \"big gap teeth\".",
      "The SNL sketch, which aired this week, imagined US President Donald Trump and his top team spending time at the fictional hotel.",
      "Wood's character Chelsea was portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and fake teeth.",
      "At one point, in a reference to the actress's teeth, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "Wood, who burst onto screens in Netflix's Sex Education, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday.",
      "\"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "\"The rest of the skit was punching up,\" Wood added, \"and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on\".",
      "She said that she was not \"hating on\" Sarah Sherman, but \"hating on the concept\".",
      "Wood also shared a comment by an unnamed user describing the sketch as \"sharp and funny\" before taking \"a screeching turn into 1970s misogyny\".",
      "\"This sums up my view,\" the actress added.",
      "She also criticised Sherman's accent, writing: \"I respect accuracy even if it's mean.\"",
      "Wood, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, wrote that she had received \"thousands of messages\" agreeing with her since sharing her posts, and that she was glad she \"said something\".",
      "Speaking to GQ magazine last week, Wood said that the conversation surrounding her teeth made her \"a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work\".",
      "\"It makes me really happy that it's symbolising rebellion and freedom, but there's a limit,\" she said.",
      "Wood added: \"I don't know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It's still going on about a woman's appearance.\"",
      "Sister's support",
      "Following her posts, Wood's younger sister Emily offered her support for the actress on her own Instagram story.",
      "Sharing a picture of the pair together, Emily Wood said her sister was \"out here personifying the word powerhouse\".",
      "\"The admiration I have for this woman is nuts. Beyond comprehension,\" she continued, adding that she felt \"deep animalistic protectiveness\" over her.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41r4kx0lko",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The distinguished Peruvian author won the Nobel Prize and courted controversy most of his life.",
    "story": [
      "Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy.",
      "With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a \"divinely gifted story-teller\". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent.",
      "At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990.",
      "Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris.",
      "His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962.",
      "Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a \"degenerate mind\".",
      "It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as \"an extremely traumatic experience\". His two years there made him see his country \"as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition\". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed.",
      "His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel.",
      "The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.",
      "Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world.",
      "Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ.",
      "Friends of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said the dispute had revolved around Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro.",
      "They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took the honour in 1982.",
      "Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule.",
      "His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odr\u00eda controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people.",
      "Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the \"Padilla Affair\" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971.",
      "In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre.",
      "Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.",
      "The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of \"indigenous violence\".",
      "Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years.",
      "Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature.",
      "His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to \"structures of power\" and \"images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".",
      "Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.",
      "His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012).",
      "He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.",
      "The author appeared in the pages of Spanish gossip magazine Hola after he left his wife of 50 years in 2015 to be with Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler, the mother of popular Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.",
      "He also continued to attract criticism for controversial remarks.",
      "In 2019 he was condemned for blaming the rise in killings of journalists in Mexico - more than 100 in the past decade - on the expansion of press freedom \"which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously\". While he also said that \"narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this\", some commentators felt that he failed to express sympathy with the victims and their families.",
      "And in 2018 he caused a stir when, in a column for Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, he called feminism \"the most determined enemy of literature, trying to decontaminate it from machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities\".",
      "He died in Lima on 13 April surrounded by his family and \"at peace\", his son \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa announced.",
      "With his death, the last of the Latin American Boom's great stars has gone."

    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",

      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said.",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - essentially rewrote the rules of hip-hop in the 1990s, but his career has been punctuated by controversies.",
      "Here is a timeline of his career and the accusations against him.",
      "1969-89: Early life in New York",
      "Sean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "His mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.",
      "In 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.",
      "Raised by his mother, he was a flashy kid who loved rap music and played football for the school team.",
      "As a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.",
      "Taking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.",
      "Early 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy",
      "At university, Mr Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.",
      "After booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.",
      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",
      "No criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.",
      "The case was settled for $3.8m (\u00a33m), of which Mr Combs paid $750,000.",
      "Mid-to-late 1990s: A new beginning",
      "Mr Combs struck upon the idea of pairing R&B singers like Mary J Blige with the street-tough sounds of hip-hop",

      "To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.",
      "Building an iconic rollercoaster",
      "Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.",
      "While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.",
      "\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.",
      "A good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.",
      "\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.",
      "How Universal Studios almost came to Essex",
      "Bond and Paddington could star at Universal park",
      "If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.",
      "During the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.",
      "While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".",
      "Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.",
      "He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.",
      "Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".",
      "Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.",
      "Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.",
      "\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"",
      "Your route to the ride is key",
      "When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.",
      "During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.",
      "The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"",
      "Discussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.",
      "An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.",
      "Alton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler). She heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.",
      "At the back of parks designed in this way you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction\", says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.",
      "\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"",
      "Another tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Mr Sinclair-Harris.",
      "\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point... like the castle in the Magic Kingdom... with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"",
      "Universal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.",
      "The finer details",
      "So the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.",
      "Then come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.",
      "Trees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".",
      "Even the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.",
      "As Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.",
      "The sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

    "summary": "The four-part series tells the story of Daniel Brennan, a deaf man on a journey of revenge.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every day, as a deaf person, you're reminded of your deafness,\" says William Mager, writer of new BBC thriller Reunion.",
      "These reminders can range from having to face medical appointments with no available interpreter to being excluded from important decisions about your own life, he says.",
      "\"All those things add up over time and generate a sense of injustice,\" Mager says, adding that artist Christine Sun Kim describes this feeling as \"deaf rage\".",
      "It is a feeling partly borne out of the frustration and isolation of living in a hearing-centred world.",
      "This rage, alongside a love of 70s thrillers, is what inspired Mager's new drama.",
      "The bilingual thriller features both British Sign Language (BSL), with subtitles, and spoken English. The majority of the cast in Reunion are deaf or use BSL in their roles.",
      "The four-part series, from the producers of Adolescence, tells the story of Daniel Brennan (Matthew Gurney), a deaf man on a journey of revenge after spending a decade in prison.",
      "Mager, a lifelong fan of 70s thrillers, says he wanted to put his own \"twist\" on films like Get Carter and The Outfit (which feature \"intimidating men in cool clothes\" on a mission of vengeance) by drawing on the deaf experience as well.",
      "\"Reunion starts out like those classic thrillers, but ends up in a very different place,\" the writer says.",
      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",
      "The Guardian called the performances in the show \"outstanding\" and the switch between signed and spoken language \"utterly seamless\", while the Independent says Reunion is \"in many ways, a groundbreaking show\".",
      "Ultimately, Mager says he wanted to touch on issues unique to the deaf community in the programme, as well as providing opportunities for deaf creatives.",
      "'Unfortunately, that's still the reality'",
      "Mager says communication is a central theme of Reunion and the drama shows how each character struggles with it.",
      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",
      "Mager says this shows how deaf people often have to rely on someone else voicing them in order to be understood.",
      "\"That can be hard for a deaf person to relinquish that control over what they're saying to someone else,\" he says.",
      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that, in his opinion, this is partly due to language deprivation, resulting from deaf children not being given access to the language they're most comfortable with from a young age.",
      "According to Simon Want, from the National Deaf Children's Society, many deaf children face barriers to accessing a good education.",
      "'I hope that door stays open'",
      "Mager says it was a \"joy\" to see the actors both deaf and hearing bringing his script to life.",
      "On set, deaf first assistant director Sam Arnold worked with hearing first assistant director Alex Szygowski to relay directions to the cast and crew.",
      "And hearing actors Anne-Marie Duff and Lara Peake learned to sign for their roles.",
      "\"They're all fantastic. My favourite thing about making Reunion has been to see the genuine enthusiasm and excitement [of] the cast and crew,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that he hopes the series will \"open a door\" for deaf creatives both in front of and behind the camera.",

    "story": [
      "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.",
      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",
      "Poulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.",
      "\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...",

      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, according to University College London (UCL) research.",
      "Overall vaping use stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16, after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds."

      "Synnovis, a public-private partnership between the medical company Synlab and Guy's and St Thomas' and King's College hospital foundation trusts, secured the contract in 2021 to deliver pathology services for just under 200 GP surgeries across south-east London.",
      "The BBC has spoken to GPs who say incorrect and delayed blood results are a \"regular concern\" and that the firm's performance is causing great distress to patients.",
      "Synnovis said it was \"incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset caused to those affected\".",
      "'National scandal'",
      "The company, which fell victim to a ransomware cyberattack in June 2024 that caused more than 1,000 NHS operations to be postponed, said the attack had \"significantly reduced our capacity to process samples\". Synnovis, which serves six hospitals in London, added that it had \"dedicated every available resource to delivering clinically safe and largely manual interim solutions\".",
      "According to more than a dozen GPs we heard from, across all of south-east London's boroughs, the severity of challenges they face under Synnovis is causing anxiety for both patients and doctors.",
      "The GPs told the BBC that the blood-test issues were leading to unnecessary hospital referrals and wasted patient appointments. In one case the BBC was told about, an elderly man who was caring for his wife with dementia needlessly spent hours in accident and emergency (A&E) due to problems with his test.",
      "One GP, who spoke to the BBC anonymously, said: \"It would [previously] never cross our minds that a blood test might not be reliable. This is now an everyday concern.",
      "\"The current problems with Synnovis is nothing short of a national scandal,\" they added.",
      "Kemi, a 17-year-old college student, started to experience heart palpitations, breathlessness and fatigue six months ago.",
      "Unable to attend college because of her health issues, in November she sought an appointment at her GP surgery, which relies on Synnovis for blood testing.",
      "When the results came back, she was told there was a problem. \"I found out there was something wrong with the blood test - my potassium was too high, which is not normal,\" she said.",
      "However, Kemi said her GP told her that her potassium levels were not actually high, but that this result was found because her blood sample had coagulated as it had waited too long to be processed.",
      "When she received her results on the NHS app - which the BBC has seen - it said they were \"invalid due to laboratory error\". Kemi said the situation had left her \"frustrated, sad and confused\".",
      "\"I'm really stuck. I'm depressed, I'm anxious that something's going to happen to me before I get a diagnosis,\" she told us. \"I am worried that I am going to end up seriously hurt because I can't get the diagnosis I need.\"",
      "GPs have told the BBC that unreliable blood results, with erroneously high levels of potassium caused by processing delays, are a regular occurrence since Synnovis began the service.",
      "High potassium levels in the blood can point to serious health issues, such as heart problems.",
      "Because of this, GPs say they cannot ignore blood-test results that indicate high potassium - even if they believe them to be incorrect - and they are obliged to refer patients immediately to A&E.",
      "GPs say these patients are often turned away after being retested at hospital, where normal potassium levels are discovered.",
      "'I couldn't reassure them'",
      "It is an issue Dr Shah - not his real name - says he experiences on a weekly basis.",
      "\"If the potassium level is above six it can cause problems with the heart and heart rhythm disturbances that could potentially prove to be fatal,\" Dr Shah said. \"It's an urgent thing that needs to have the sample repeated and to make sure the result is genuine or a false reading.\"",
      "Dr Shah, who has been a GP for nearly three decades, said the frequency of elevated potassium in blood results had been unusually high at his surgery in recent years.",
      "\"It turned out that there were delays in the collection of samples from the GP surgeries, then to the labs\u2026 delays in processing in the labs, which was causing the results to be high,\" he said.",
      "Dr Shah told the BBC he recently had to send a man in his 80s to hospital as his potassium level appeared elevated on a Synnovis blood test. He explained that the patient had come to the surgery with his wife who had dementia and his daughter, and the family were concerned about long waiting times at A&E that evening.",
      "\"I had to say to them they shouldn't leave it until the next day because whilst I thought it was normal, I couldn't reassure them,\" Dr Shah explained. At hospital, the patient's potassium level was eventually found to be normal and he was discharged.",
      "Trainees urged to help hospitals after cyber-attack",
      "Dr Shah added: \"I'm probably sending a couple of patients to A&E a week because of results I suspect to be faulty. Since Synnovis took over pathology services for south-east London, it's pretty much been a catalogue of disasters.",
      "\"We're almost second-guessing the pathology system and it's something that never used to happen.",
      "\"You go to a shoe shop, you expect to buy a pair of shoes; you have a pathology service, you expect accuracy and reliability. That's not happening.\"",
      "Dr Shah's account is not a lone one.",
      "A range of claims has been made by the 14 GPs we have heard from \u2013 who all wanted to remain anonymous for professional reasons.",
      "One GP told the BBC that the increased workload resulting from having to assess and then escalate unreliable results was leading to \"increased burnout and people wanting to leave the profession\".",
      "Several GPs told of recent instances where they were unable to do timely diabetes tests for patients because of Synnovis delays.",
      "Londonwide LMCs (local medical committees), the body that represents and supports GPs across the capital, said the problems with blood-test delays and inaccuracies experienced by GPs in south-east London were not consistent with the pathology service across other parts of the city.",
      "\"We have never had so many emails and questions, apart from the beginning of Covid, about one particular thing, from one area in London, said Michelle Drage, CEO of Londonwide LMCs.",
      "\"This is happening on a daily basis, on a clinic-by-clinic basis,\" she added.",
      "Acknowledging the impact the problems have had on the morale and workload of GPs, Dr Drage said: \"We do not believe we can rely on Synnovis for accuracy. Our GPs have lost faith and trust in that service \u2013 that's a horrible situation to be in.\"",
      "In October, Londonwide LMCs escalated its concerns to the Southeast London Integrated Care Board \u2013 the body charged with holding to account the NHS hospital trusts partnered with Synnovis.",
      "Dr Drage said the written response it received was \"unsatisfactory\".",
      "As well as hearing the testimony of doctors, the BBC has seen dozens of Synnovis emails, sent to GPs from 2021 to the present day, apologising and attempting to account for various pathology problems, for instance regarding tests for malaria and diabetes.",
      "One email showed Synnovis apologising for a backlog of 70,000 test results in spring 2024 - before the cyber-attack.",
      "Dr Jayne - not her real name - explained that it took Synnovis a month to discover the backlog and begin to address it. \"It's really difficult to quantify that problem\u2026 70,000 worries,\" the GP of nearly 20 years told the BBC.",
      "\"It's really stressful. We try to protect our patients. I feel like I'm constantly apologising for the system. It's not my fault. We really want to be getting on with our work properly and not managing Synnovis's errors.\"",
      "Don't blame us for people suffering - London hospital hackers",
      "Southeast London Integrated Care Board said in a statement that tests requested by south-east London GPs alone amounted to about 10,000 a day, \"with a number of logistical steps involved, from blood taking through to results reporting\".",
      "It said there had been \"a number of incidents\" since Synnovis took on pathology services for south-east London that had been driven by a \"number of factors, including incidents that have impacted on the Synnovis service but which were outside of their control\".",
      "The statement continued: \"You will also be aware that one of these incidents was a criminal cyberattack, the response to which was an extraordinary effort from multiple partners, including Synnovis, to maintain a viable service for our GP colleagues, while Synnovis undertook the significant task of rebuilding their systems from the ground up.\"",
      "According to a statement released by NHS England in October, 10,152 acute outpatient appointments and 1,710 elective procedures were postponed as a result of the cyberattack.",
      "The statement said: \"The final stages of recovery following the cyber attack on pathology services provider Synnovis in June are almost complete, which means nearly all services are now up and running.\"",
      "'Extremely challenging'",
      "In its statement, Synnovis said it offered more than 6,000 different types of test, serving almost two million patients, six hospitals and 191 GP practices across 249 sites.",
      "\"While we understand that any error at all can cause patient and practitioner distress, erroneous Synnovis tests account for significantly less than 0.001% of the 150,000 tests we process per day.\"",
      "However, these figures appear to include all Synnovis testing, including urine tests.",
      "Synnovis added in its statement: \"The provision of Synnovis's pathology services for GPs is enabled through a range of test-request and results systems and software, a significant portion of which predates the Synnovis contract and are provided by legacy third-party suppliers.",
      "\"We are very aware that this has been an extremely challenging and sometimes distressing period for patients and front-line NHS colleagues and are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset caused to those affected.\"",
      "For college student Kemi, her recent experiences have made her lose confidence in the health service.",
      "She said: \"I feel like as a young person, not being able to have access to reliable results sets the precedent that I can't have an independent health journey as a 17-year-old. It's hard to know where I can go from here.",
      "\"It might seem like it's just a blood test but it's serious. It can be a matter of life and death.\"",

      "More than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health.",
      "Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work.",
      "It has been identified as one of the biggest public health threats facing the world's population.",
      "A new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children.",

      "Increased use of antibiotics",
      "Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia.",
      "They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid.",
      "But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down.",
      "The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections.",
      "Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa.",
      "Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.",
      "Dwindling options",
      "The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.",
      "Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month.",
      "\"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event.",

      "Is there a solution to AMR?",
      "The WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threats we face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers.",
      "\"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said.",
      "\"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\"",
      "The best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds.",
      "\"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\"",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\".",
      "\"These findings should serve as a wake-up call for global health leaders. Without decisive action, AMR could undermine decades of progress in child health, particularly in the world's most vulnerable regions.\"",

      "\"[Steel] is a sensitive sector around the world and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China,\" he added.",

      "Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways.",
      "The materials have been paid for by the government, which industry minister Sarah Jones said are covered by existing budgets.",
      "\"We have a \u00a32.5bn fund for steel within the department for business so we won't be drawing down on any extra resources and people can be reassured of that,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials.",
      "Asked if the government could guarantee there would be no job cuts at the North Lincolnshire steelworks, Reynolds there may be a \"different employment footprint\".",

      "Talks between officials and Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough.",
      "The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "\"We were working in good faith on what we thought was a good deal on the table,\" said Jones.",
      "\"That relationship broke down when, in the middle of a consultation about the future of the site, they refused to buy the raw materials to keep that site going. That was an act of bad faith and that's why we had to intervene in the way that we did.\"",
      "Reynolds previously said it \"became clear\" that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting the government to secure control of the site.",

      "The DWP currently only aims to check half of these alerts on its internal database, but now 20 extra staff will join a team of just over 70 to increase that to 100%.",
      "The charity Carers UK welcomed the move as one that could prevent overpayments running into thousands of pounds.",
      "Inquiry announced after carers forced to repay benefits",
      "Carer's Allowance overpayment debt rises to \u00a3250m",
      "But its chief executive, Helen Walker, warned clearing the backlog was likely to result in many more carers discovering they have debts.",
      "The latest available figures show there were 32,533 outstanding \"alerts\" on the DWP's system as of 14 February.",
      "The department estimated a further 99,000 alerts would be generated in 2025/26.",
      "Recent analysis for the department found that when those alerts were investigated, 28% of cases resulted in no change, while 5% resulted in arrears being paid to carers, and 67% identified overpayments.",

      "Claimants are required by law to inform the DWP promptly if their circumstances change.",
      "But some carers have previously told the BBC they were unaware they had exceeded the earnings limit until they were informed years later, when they owed thousands. They described demands for repayments as \"wrong\" and \"unfair\".",
      "The DWP has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite its systems flagging when a claimant is earning too much.",
      "Charities have called on the government to write off existing substantial overpayment debts where carers could have been notified sooner.",

      "But in a letter to Carers UK, the Minister for Social Security and Disability Sir Stephen Timms said the department must \"carefully balance our duty to the taxpayer to recover overpayments with safeguards in place to manage repayments fairly\".",
      "He said the DWP was carrying out \"scoping work\" on whether introducing a taper might incentivise unpaid carers to do some paid work.",

      "Adoption UK said the news was \"distressing\" for families, who had already faced \"an agonising wait\" to find out whether the adoption and special guardian support fund would continue.",
      "Last year each eligible child could access \u00a32,500 for specialist assessment and \u00a35,000 for therapy. But the therapy limit has now been cut to \u00a33,000 per year, while separate funding for specialist assessment has been axed.",
      "The government said the move would \"ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support\".",
      "In an email to stakeholders, seen by the BBC, the Department for Education said the \"difficult decision\" came as demand for the fund \"continues to grow significantly\".",

      "Adoption fund to continue after families 'left in limbo'",

      "The overall funding for the scheme remains the same as last year.",

      "Louisa said her own family and others affected were \"anxious, fearful, sad and in disbelief at what [the cut] means for their children\".",
      "For the last two years, her eldest has used the maximum allocation of funding for therapy.",
      "He had already been forced to stop his therapy sessions at the end of January because future funding had not been confirmed, leaving the family in \"limbo\" and \"watching the decline in front of our eyes\".",
      "Louisa said this meant he had not been able to attend school full-time and she feared he would continue to go backwards if he could no longer get the same level of support.",

      "Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, children and families Munira Wilson has written to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson calling on her to reverse the cuts.",

      "The charity Kinship, which represents friends and families who step in to raise a child when parents are not able to, said the news was a \"further blow\", after therapy had been disrupted by the delay in renewing the scheme.",
      "Chief executive Dr Lucy Peake said the government's \"confused and ill-considered approach\" of boosting awareness of the scheme but not supporting this with extra funding \"risks pushing more families to breaking point\".",
      "Charities said the announcement would mean further delays for families trying to access therapy, while adoption agencies made adjustments to funding applications.",
      "The fund is available for adopted children and young people up to the age of 21, as well as those aged up to 25 if they have an education, health and care plan.",

      "The unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre included a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all imports from the UK, France and other long-standing trade partners.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
      "UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. It is understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs, and cover elements of trade in both goods and services.",
      "In Vance's wide-ranging interview with UnHerd, he suggested a US-UK trade deal would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "He mentioned Germany as an example of a country that exported heavily to the US but by comparison was \"pretty tough on a lot of American\" exports.",

      "She told BBC Breakfast that talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US. We think that would be the best way to secure jobs and growth in our country,\" she added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally\".",
      "\"It seems to me that President Trump is bypassing Congress. We don't want to copy that,\" he told the BBC's World at One programme.",
      "Any trade deal with the US should be \"properly examined\" by ministers, he added.",

      "The president has since made some exemptions, and stock markets on Monday showed signs of recovery, although they are still down on the month.",
      "Vance said any implementation of a new system is going to make financial markets \"jittery\" and that Trump is committed to the tariff strategy as \"a long-term play\".",
      "\"What we want is to see lower trade deficits, really across the board,\" Vance said.",
      "The vice-president also expressed an affinity for Europe, after disparaging remarks between him and other top US officials were leaked from a private chat.",
      "\"I love European people. I've said repeatedly that I think that you can't separate American culture from European culture,\" Vance said.",
      "He also emphasised points that he and the White House have made repeatedly, saying that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defence.",
      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance went on to address the war in Ukraine and criticism that the US might be getting too cosy with Russia President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",

      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",

    "summary": "An emergency law has handed control of the UK's only remaining plant making virgin steel to the government.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "Ministers say they have secured the raw materials needed to keep the plant's blast furnaces working in the \"coming weeks\", while they look for a long-term solution.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",
      "British Steel to get supplies to keep furnaces burningUK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "British Steel to get supplies to keep furnaces burning",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

      "Surfers Against Sewage said the Environment Agency data showed the number of incidents was more than double its target.",
      "Such spills have the potential to cause damage to wildlife and illness for people making use of the country's rivers and seas.",
      "Water UK, the industry body representing UK water and sewage companies, said companies plan to invest \u00a312bn to reduce spills by the end of the decade.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Government has broken the law on sewage, says watchdog",
      "As well as reporting the total number of sewage spills annually, environmental regulator the Environment Agency also records the number of most serious pollution incidents, which are likely to cause serious harm to wildlife and people.",
      "Eight years ago, the EA remarked that the water sector was not doing enough to reduce serious pollution incidents. It said this was causing \"distress to local communities and blighting rivers and beaches.\"",
      "The industry was set a target to reduce these incidents by 40% by 2025 against 2016 levels.",
      "The latest publicly availably data is to the end of 2023. But following a Freedom of Information request, Surfers Against Sewage obtained the data up to the start of 2025.",
      "This showed that 2,487 pollution incidents were recorded last year - a 31% increase on the 2016 levels, and almost double the original EA target.",
      "\"The water industry fails, fails and fails again,\" said Giles Bristow, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned.",
      "They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal.",
      "The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed \"the last remaining\" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands.",

      "Wildfire home scare has owners fearing about future",
      "Some wildlife may not return after recurring fires",
      "Aerial images show land devastated by wildfire",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to \"act responsibly\" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.",
      "The National Trust said 2025 was \"turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country\".",
      "\"We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,\" said Ben MacCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation.",
      "A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.",
      "Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.",
      "Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.",
      "In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.",
      "While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".",
      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr MacCarthy said.",
      "He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.",
      "Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.",
      "Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.",
      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",
      "The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.",
      "\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",
      "When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.",
      "'Deliberate fire setting is a crime'",
      "Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.",

      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",

      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",

      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",

      "Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world",
      "'Black Swan Event'",
      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",
      "However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.",
      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",
      "But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\"",
      "If a volcano erupted with really high levels of ash affecting UK or European airspace, then \"absolutely we will see disruption because it's a safety issue\", added  Mr Nicholson.",

      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, manager for clean industry & transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality produce in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Making microchips: the secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "The MP's office confirmed her account was hacked on Tuesday morning and said \"steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts\".",

      "Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by cyber criminals.",

      "Luke Nolan, a senior research associate at CoinShares, an asset management company specialising in digital assets, said the hack of Powell's account was an example of \"pump and dump\".",
      "This is when the people who created the cryptocoin inflate its value, get others to invest, and then sell their majority share to get profit, but leave the coin worthless.",
      "Mr Nolan said there had only been 34 transactions on the coin, which would have led to a profit of about \u00a3225.",

      "His testimony is part of a case first brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020 during the final days of the first Trump administration.",
      "The US competition watchdog alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.",
      "The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Meta says there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube.",
      "Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr Zuckerberg was the first witness in the case on Monday at a federal court in Washington DC. The trial is expected to last for two months.",
      "The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.\"",
      "The following year, he sent another email saying the company was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up\".",
      "On the stand, Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails \"relatively early\" conversations about buying the app. He added that Meta had improved Instagram over the years.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg also said he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network. He is expected to continue his testimony on Tuesday.",
      "The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1bn and WhatsApp for $19bn as a defensive move.",
      "\"They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" said FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in his opening statement at Monday's trial.",
      "Meta countered that the lawsuit from the FTC, which originally reviewed and approved both those acquisitions, was \"misguided\".",
      "Meta \"acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them alongside Facebook\", the company's attorney Mark Hansen argued.",
      "The FTC lawyer cited a 2012 memo from Mr Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of \"neutralising\" Instagram.",
      "Mr Matheson called that message \"a smoking gun\".",
      "Meta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better.",
      "\"Acquisitions to improve and grow\" have never been found unlawful, Meta's lead litigator, said on Monday, \"and they should not be found unlawful here\".",
      "Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products.",
      "Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025. according to research firm Emarketer.",
      "Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election.",
      "The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.",
      "The company also announced in January that it was rolling back content moderation policies that Republicans said had amounted to censorship.",
      "It also agreed to pay Trump $25m to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the US Capitol riot in 2021.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg has also visited the White House in recent weeks.",
      "The Meta boss has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: \"The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.\"",
      "FTC v Meta begins as another major antitrust case - USA v Google - grinds on.",
      "The Department of Justice won the first phase of that case last summer when Judge Amit Mehta found that Google holds a monopoly in online search, with a market share of around 90%.",
      "Last month, government attorneys reiterated a demand made during the Biden administration that a court break up Google's search monopoly.",
      "The FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.",
      "\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"",
      "That's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said.",
      "Amazon and Apple also face antitrust lawsuits by US enforcers."

      "This is the second time Sony has increased the RRP for its latest console.",
      "Its initial \u00a3360 price tag for the disc drive-free digital edition was seen as a low price at the time, as Sony sought to match its price to that of the Xbox Series X.",
      "But it rose the price by \u00a330 in 2022 - meaning with the latest price increase, the digital edition of the PS5 has increased by roughly \u00a370 since it first went on sale.",

      "It took a couple of minutes to generate each version and overall the process was slower than I would have liked, potentially because of its popularity.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

      "\"He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,\" Ms Allensworth says.",
      "On Monday, Matheson referenced a 2012 memo from Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of \"neutralising\" Instagram. Matheson called the message \"a smoking gun.\"",
      "Meta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better.",

      "This has bewildered traders from more than 30,000 businesses who have come to the annual fair to show off their goods in several exhibition halls the size of 200 football pitches.",

      "While China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export-driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth.",

      "China is facing the prospect of losing a trading partner which buys more than $400bn (\u00a3302bn) worth of goods each year, but the pain will also be felt on the other side, with economists warning that the US could be heading for a recession.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty is President Trump, who is known for his brinkmanship. He has continued to push Beijing and China has refused to back down.",
      "However, Beijing has said it will not add any more to the current 125% tariff rate on US goods. They could retaliate in other ways \u2013 but it offers the two sides some breathing room from a week that sparked an economic war.",

      "Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government.",
      "Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries.",
      "Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza.",
      "It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released.",
      "The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering.",
      "Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough.",
      "The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: \"We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great.\"",
      "\"We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,\" the official went on.",
      "\"They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them.\"",
      "Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held \"under fire\".",
      "Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC.",
      "The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged.",
      "Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him.",
      "The IDF said in a statement that it \"struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander\" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence.",
      "It also said a \"precise munition\" was used to mitigate harm in the area.",
      "The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said he was \"deeply alarmed\" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said.",
      "Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as \"a command-and-control centre\" - something the group denied.",
      "Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted.",
      "The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients.",
      "\"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" the spokesman for Guterres said.",
      "He added that the attack dealt \"a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip\", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water.",
      "The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population.",
      "Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population.",
      "The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in \"no-go\" zones,\" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements.",
      "In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities.",
      "However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war.",
      "Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage.",
      "It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting.",
      "In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities.",
      "There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement.",
      "This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers."

    "story": [
      "Peru's former president, Ollanta Humala, has been found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "A court in the capital, Lima, said that Humala had accepted illegal funds from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaigns in 2006 and 2011.",
      "His wife, Nadine Heredia, who co-founded the Nationalist Party with Humala, was also found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years.",
      "Heredia was granted asylum by Brazil and will have safe passage to travel there with her son, Peru's foreign ministry said.",
      "Prosecutors had asked that Humala be sentenced to 20 years in jail and Heredia to 26 and a half years.",
      "After a trial lasting more than three years, the court gave its long-awaited verdict on Tuesday.",
      "Humala attended the verdict in person while his wife heard it via video link.",
      "The 62-year-old former president and his wife had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Who is Ollanta Humala?",
      "Humala, a former army officer who fought against the Maoist Shining Path rebels, first came to national prominence in 2000 when he led a short-lived military rebellion against then-President Alberto Fujimori.",
      "In 2006, he ran for president. He allied himself with the Venezuelan president at the time, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and prosecutors alleged that Humala had accepted illegal funding from Ch\u00e1vez to finance his campaign.",
      "His rival for the presidency, Alan Garc\u00eda, used Humala's close ties to Ch\u00e1vez as a way to attack him, warning voters \"not to let Peru turn into another Venezuela\".",
      "In 2011, Humala ran for the presidency again, this time on a more moderate platform.",
      "He said that rather than emulating Ch\u00e1vez's socialist revolution in Venezuela, he would model his policies on those of the Brazilian president at the time, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "His approach proved successful and he defeated his right-wing rival, Keiko Fujimori.",
      "But violent social conflicts early on his presidency quickly dented his popularity.",
      "He also lost the support of many members of Congress, further weakening his position.",
      "His legal troubles started shortly after his term had finished in 2016.",
      "That year, the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht confessed to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and political parties across Latin America, to win business orders.",
      "Prosecutors accused Humala and his wife of receiving millions of dollars from Odebrecht.",
      "A year later, a judge ordered that the couple be placed in pre-trial detention.",
      "They were released after a year but the investigation into their links with Odebrecht continued, culminating in today's verdict."

      "The cardinal continued: \"He is saying you... amid life's difficulties, amid work, amid pain, amid suffering, are destined to be saints.\"",
      "The usual formal process for someone to be declared a saint would next involve beatification, one step short of full sainthood.",

      "The former president, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, has rarely criticised or rebuked government officials or government policies on social media since leaving the White House almost a decade ago.

      "Ghana has banned all foreigners from trading in its local gold market as part of efforts to boost national revenue and streamline the country's mining sector.",
      "It follows the enactment of a new law earlier this month that grants exclusive authority of gold mining to a new state body, the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod).",
      "\"All foreigners are hereby notified to exit the local gold trading market not later than 30th April, 2025,\" said GoldBod spokesperson Prince Kwame Minkah in a statement.",

      "However, foreigners are allowed to apply to buy or off-take gold directly from the GoldBod but can no longer operate within the local gold value chain.",
      "The licenses of local dealers have also been revoked but given a grace period to allow a smooth transition before the directive takes effect next month.",

      "GoldBod warned that \"it shall constitute a punishable offence for a person to purchase or deal in gold in the country without a licence issued by the new board.",
      "The government has allocated $279m (\u00a3212) to the new body to purchase and export at least three tonnes of gold per week.",
      "The move is meant to help boost foreign exchange inflows and stabilise the local currency, said Finance Minister Cassel Ato Forson.",
      "But Kwaku Effah Asuahene, the chairman of the  Chamber of Bullion Traders Ghana, fears that the government may not be able to raise enough revenue to purchase all the gold.",
      "He told BBC that while they support the initiative, they would have preferred to be allowed to partner with foreign investors to purchase the gold and export it through GoldBod.",
      "Although GoldBod has not been created to specifically deal with illegal mining, the new directive could also make it difficult for illegal miners to sell gold in the country.",
      "Ghana has been dealing with severe environmental pollution caused by the activities of illegal miners, and over 60% of the country's water bodies have been affected.",
      "The ban is seen as the first concrete step by the new administration of President Mahama to tighten regulation and control of the gold sector and deliver on its anti-galamsey campaign promises.",
      "\"It sends a strong message to foreign actors - especially Chinese operatives - who have circumvented local laws for years,\" Nana Asante Krobea, a mining governance consultant, told the AFP news agency.",
      "He said if properly applied, the new law could bolster government revenue and \"bring some order to the chaos in the gold sector\".",

    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality produce in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Making microchips: the secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",

      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's return to the White House has created flashpoints between the North American neighbours.",
    "story": [
      "Machias Seal Island is a tiny dot on maps of North America. But the fogbound rock is significant for its location in an area known as the \"Grey Zone\" \u2013 the site of a rare international dispute between Canada and the United States.",
      "The two neighbours and long-time allies have each long laid claim to the island and surrounding water, where the US state of Maine meets Canada's New Brunswick province \u2013 and with that claim, the right to catch and sell the prized local lobsters.",
      "John Drouin, a US lobsterman who has fished in the Grey Zone for 30 years, tells of the mad dash by Canadian and American fishermen to place lobster traps at the start of the summer catching season each year.",
      "\"People have literally lost parts of their bodies, have had concussions, [their] head smashed and everything,\" he says.",
      "The injuries have been caused when lobstermen have been caught up in each other's lines. He says one friend lost his thumb after it became caught up in a Canadian line, what Mr Drouin calls his battle scar from the Grey Zone.",
      "The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s \u2013 and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway.",
      "It has stood as a quirk \u2013 an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries.",
      "But that could all be about to change.",
      "US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, steep tariffs on Canadian imports and rhetoric about making the country the 51st state has sparked a series of fresh flashpoints, with the possibility that he may ultimately wish to subsume Canada into the US hanging over everything. Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada?",
      "Lobster wars",
      "Cutler, Maine, is the closest US town to the Grey Zone. It has a collection of scattered houses, one supply store and, for good reason, a lobster wholesaler.",
      "Aside from a few big-city retirees and holiday-goers, Cutler owes its existence to the bountiful crustaceans that inhabit the offshore waters. And for the lobstermen of Cutler, the international limbo of the Grey Zone is their everyday reality, as they scatter their traps along the bottom of the Gulf of Maine to catch the prized lobsters and bring them to market.",
      "During lobster season, the Grey Zone is packed with boats and buoys marking the location of their traps. When the waters get crowded and livelihoods are at stake, things can get ugly.",
      "\"Do we like it? Not in the least,\" says Mr Drouin. He has caught lobsters in the Grey Zone for 30 years. \"I will continue to complain about it until I can't breathe anymore.\"",
      "Another Maine lobsterman, Nick Lemieux, said he and his sons have had nearly 200 traps stolen in recent years \u2013 and he blames their rivals to the north.",
      "\"This is our area, and it's all we have to work with,\" he said. \"Things like that don't sit very well with us.\"",
      "Americans accuse the Canadians of operating under a different, more accommodating set of rules that allow them to catch larger lobsters.",
      "Canadians counter that the Americans have higher catch limits and are surreptitiously fishing in their territorial waters.",
      "The union representing Canada's fishery officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence \u2013 and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone.",
      "The Machias Seal Island lightstation has lightkeepers on site all year round but the Canadian Coast Guard sends additional technical support if there is an issue with the automated aid to navigation.",
      "The Americans point to US Marines who occupied the island during World War One as their proof of sovereignty.",
      "A series of border disputes",
      "The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada.",
      "When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the \"special bonds\" between the two nations that \"share much more than a border\".",
      "Yet his rhetoric has since changed sharply.",
      "In recent months, Trump has repeatedly called Canada the \"51st state\" of the US \u2013 and the White House has expressed a willingness to open up new areas of dispute all along the US-Canada border.",
      "In September, the president voiced designs on Canadian water in British Columbia in the west of the country, for instance, suggesting it could be piped to drought-parched California: \"You have millions of gallons of water pouring down from the north\u2026 they have essentially a very large faucet\".",
      "Approximately 1,500 miles further east, the Great Lakes could become another site of potential conflict, as US officials told their Canadian counterparts they are considering withdrawing from treaties over their coordinated environmental regulation.",
      "And even further east, a library has become the unlikely setting for a flashpoint: built deliberately to straddle the Vermont-Quebec border as a symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House used to be open to residents from both nations.",
      "However in March, America changed the rules so that Canadians are required to pass through immigration control before they access the building, with the US Department of Homeland Security claiming it was in response to drug trafficking.",
      "Battle for natural resources",
      "Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber \u2013 the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized.",
      "While Trump has disavowed any desire for Canada's lumber, energy stockpiles or manufactured products, in February Trudeau reportedly told a closed-door meeting of Canadian business and labour leaders that he saw it differently.",
      "\"I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have but that may even be why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state. They're very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,\" the CBC quoted Trudeau as saying.",
      "Jordan Heath-Rawlings, a Canadian journalist and host of The Big Story podcast, believes Trump wants Canadian resources, and that the president's annexation comments should be taken seriously.",
      "\"He likes the idea of being the guy to bring in a huge land mass,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. \"He probably wants the Arctic, which is obviously going to become much more valuable in the years to come.\"",
      "For Trump, even the US-Canadian border itself is suspect. \"If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it between Canada and the US,\" he said in March. \"Somebody did it a long time ago, and it makes no sense.\"",
      "Needless to say, Trump's comments have rankled Canadian leaders, who warn of the president's ultimate designs on their homeland.",
      "In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\".",
      "The previous month, after Trump first announced new tariffs on Canada, Trudeau had said: \"Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that [annexing Canada] is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.\"",
      "If US territorial ambitions for Canada are, in fact, a \"real thing\", it presents a simple, vexing question. Why? Why would the US, which has had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties with its northern neighbour for more than a century, put all of that at risk?",
      "Exception rather than the norm",
      "Some see a pattern in Trump's designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2013 one that reflects a dramatic change in how the US sees itself in the world.",
      "It has been most clearly articulated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in January that the post-World War Two dominance of the US was more the exception than the norm.",
      "\"Eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multi-polar world, multiple great powers in different parts of the planet,\" he said. \"We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and \u2026 rogue states like Iran and North Korea.\"",
      "According to Michael Williams, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, if the current Trump administration thinks that American world dominance is no longer possible or even desired, the US might pull back from far-flung conflicts and European commitments.",
      "Instead, says Prof Williams, the US would prioritise its \"territorial core\", creating a continental fortress of sorts, insulated on both sides by the vastness of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.",
      "\"If this is your plan, you seek to control key geographic choke points,\" he says. \"You maximise access to natural resources, of which Canada has plenty, and you reshore industry whenever possible.\"",
      "Such a geopolitical outlook is hardly new. In the 1820s, US President James Monroe articulated a new global order in which America and Europe confined themselves to their own hemispheres.",
      "But it does represent a remarkable shift in US foreign policy since the end of World War Two.",
      "A plan or a whim?",
      "Prof Williams acknowledges that it's difficult to figure out exactly what the US president is thinking \u2013 a view wholeheartedly endorsed by John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser for more than a year of his first presidential term.",
      "\"Trump has no philosophy,\" he says. \"He gets ideas, but does not follow a coherent pattern. There is no underlying strategy.\"",
      "The president is currently fixated on minerals and natural resources, he said, but Mr Bolton argues the best way to go about doing that is through the private sector, not by floating the idea of annexing an ally. Canada, for its part, has offered to work with US companies on joint mining partnerships.",
      "Prof Williams and Mr Bolton agree that whatever the motivations behind Trump's designs on Canada, the diplomatic damage that's being done will be difficult to undo \u2013 and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high.",
      "Boycotts and cancelled trips",
      "\"Trump likes to say in a lot of contexts that other people don't have any cards,\" says Prof Williams. \"But the further you push people to the wall, the more you may find that they have cards that you didn't know they had \u2013 and they might be willing to play them. And even if you have more cards, the consequences of doing so can easily spiral out of control in some really bad ways.\"",
      "Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling winter trips south, which has had an impact on tourist communities in Florida.",
      "\"We're not looking for a fight, but Canada's ready for one,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings.",
      "The idea that the trust between the US and Canada has been broken is one that's been embraced by the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as a general election looms.",
      "\"The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,\" he said recently. \"I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "Back in the 19th Century, territorial conflicts and flare-ups along the US-Canada border were a more frequent occurrence. Americans made multiple unsuccessful attempts to capture Canadian territory during the 1812 War.",
      "In 1844, some Americans called for military force if the UK wouldn't agree to its claims in the Pacific Northwest.",
      "The 1859 \"pig dispute\" involved contested islands near Vancouver and the unfortunate shooting of a British hog that had intruded on an American's garden.",
      "All that seemed the stuff of dusty history books, where the Grey Zone was a diplomatic oddity \u2013 an exception to a peaceful norm in the modern world of developed and integrated democracies.",
      "But that calm is now broken, and no one is sure where these stormy waters will lead either country.",

    "story": [
      "\"She left no last words. She was dead when she was carried away,\" says Hafiza quietly, as she describes how her mother was killed in a city under siege in Darfur, during Sudan's civil war, which began exactly two years ago.",
      "The 21-year-old recorded how her family's life was turned upside down by her mother's death, on one of several phones the BBC World Service managed to get to people trapped in the crossfire in el-Fasher.",
      "Under constant bombardment, el-Fasher has been largely cut off from the outside world for a year, making it impossible for journalists to enter the city. For safety reasons, we are only using the first names of people who wanted to film their lives and share their stories on the BBC phones.",
      "Hafiza describes how she suddenly found herself responsible for her five-year-old brother and two teenage sisters.",
      "Their father had died before the start of the war, which has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and caused the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.",
      "The two rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",
      "Hafiza's home is the last major city controlled by the military in Sudan's western region of Darfur, and has been under siege by the RSF for the past 12 months.",
      "In August 2024, a shell hit the market where her mother had gone to sell household goods.",
      "\"Grief is very difficult, I still can't bring myself to visit her workplace,\" says Hafiza in one of her first video messages after receiving her phone, shortly after her mother's death.",
      "\"I spend my time crying alone at home.\"",
      "Both sides in the war have been accused of war crimes and deliberately targeting civilians - which they deny. The RSF has also previously denied accusations from the US and human rights groups that it has committed a genocide against non-Arab groups in other parts of Darfur after it seized control of those areas.",
      "The RSF controls passage in and out the city and sometimes allows civilians to leave, so Hafiza managed to send her siblings to stay with family in a neutral area.",
      "But she stayed to try to earn money to support them.",
      "In her messages, she describes her days distributing blankets and water to displaced people living in shelters, helping at a community kitchen and supporting a breast cancer awareness group in return for a little money to help her survive.",
      "Her nights are spent alone.",
      "\"I remember the places where my mother and siblings used to sit, I feel broken,\" she adds.",
      "In almost every video 32-year-old Mostafa sent us, the sound of shelling and gunfire can be heard in the background.",
      "\"We endure relentless artillery shelling, both day and night, by the RSF,\" he says.",
      "One day, after visiting family, he returned to find his house near the city centre had been hit by shells - the roof and walls were damaged - and looters had ransacked what was left.",
      "\"Everything was turned upside down. Most houses in our neighbourhood have been looted,\" he says, blaming the RSF.",
      "While Mostafa was volunteering at a shelter for displaced people, the area came under intense attack. He kept his camera rolling as he hid, flinching at each explosion.",
      "\"There is no safe place in el-Fasher,\" he says. \"Even refugee camps are being bombed with artillery shells.",
      "\"Death can strike anyone, anytime, without warning\u2026 by a bullet, shelling, hunger or thirst.\"",
      "In another message, he talks about the lack of clean water, describing how people drink from sources contaminated with sewage.",
      "Both Mostafa and 26-year-old Manahel, who also received a BBC phone, volunteered at community kitchens funded by donations from Sudanese people living elsewhere.",
      "The UN has warned of famine in the city, something that has already happened at the nearby Zamzam camp, which is home to more than 500,000 displaced people.",
      "Many people cannot get to the market \"and if they go, they find high prices\", explains Manahel.",
      "\"Every family is equal now - there is no rich or poor. People can't afford the basic necessities like food.\"",
      "After cooking meals such as rice and stew, they deliver the food to people in shelters. For many, it is the only meal they will have for the day.",
      "When the war started, Manahel had just finished university, where she studied Sharia and law.",
      "As the fighting reached el-Fasher, she moved with her mother and six siblings to a safer area, further away from the front line.",
      "\"You lose your home, everything you own and find yourself in a new place with nothing,\" she says.",
      "But her father refused to leave their house. Some neighbours had entrusted him with their belongings, and he decided to stay to protect them - a decision that cost him his life.",
      "She says he was killed by RSF artillery in September 2024.",
      "Since the siege began a year ago, almost 2,000 people have been killed or injured in el-Fasher, according to the UN.",
      "After sunset, people rarely leave their homes. The lack of electricity can make night-time frightening for many of el-Fasher's one million residents.",
      "People with solar power or batteries are scared to turn lights on because they \"could be detected by drones\", explains Manahel.",
      "There were times we could not reach her or the others for several days because they had no internet access.",
      "But above all these worries, there is one particular fear that both Manahel and Hafiza share if the city falls to the RSF.",
      "\"As a girl, I might get raped,\" Hafiza says in one of her messages.",
      "She, Manahel and Mostafa are all from non-Arabic communities and their fear stems from what happened in other cities that the RSF has taken, most notably el-Geneina, 250 miles (400km) west of el-Fasher.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "In 2023 it witnessed horrific massacres, along ethnic lines, which the US and others say amounted to genocide. RSF fighters and allied Arab militia allegedly targeted people from non-Arab ethnic groups, such as the Massalit - which the RSF has previously denied.",
      "A Massalit woman I met in a refugee camp over the border in Chad described how she was gang-raped by RSF fighters and was unable to walk for nearly two weeks, while the UN has said girls as young as 14 were raped.",
      "One man told me how he witnessed a massacre by RSF forces - he escaped after he was injured and left for dead.",
      "The UN estimates that between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in el-Geneina alone in 2023. And now more than a quarter of a million people from the city - half its former population - are among those living in refugee camps in Chad.",
      "We put these accusations to the RSF but it did not respond. However, in the past it has denied any involvement in ethnic cleansing in Darfur, saying the perpetrators had worn RSF clothing to shift the blame to them.",
      "Few reporters have had access to el-Geneina since then, but after months of negotiation with the city's civil authorities, a BBC team was allowed to visit in December 2024.",
      "We were assigned minders from the governor's office and were only allowed to see what they wanted to show us.",
      "It was immediately clear that the RSF was in control. I saw their fighters patrolling the streets in armed vehicles and had a brief conversation with some of them, when they showed me their anti-vehicle rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.",
      "It did not take long to realise how differently they viewed the conflict. Their commander insisted there were no civilians like Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel living in el-Fasher.",
      "\"The person who stays in a war zone is participating in the war, there are no civilians, they are all from the army,\" he said.",
      "He claimed el-Geneina was now peaceful and that most of its residents - \"around 90%\" - had come back. \"Homes that were previously empty are now occupied again.\"",
      "But hundreds of thousands of the city's residents are still living as refugees in Chad, and I saw many deserted and destroyed neighbourhoods as we drove around.",
      "With the minders watching us, it was hard to get a true picture of life in el-Geneina. They took us to a bustling vegetable market, where I asked people about their lives.",
      "Each time I asked someone a question, I noticed them glance at the minder over my shoulder before answering that everything was \"fine\", apart from a few comments about high prices.",
      "However, my minder would often whisper in my ear afterwards, saying people were exaggerating about the prices.",
      "We ended our trip with an interview with Tijani Karshoum, the governor of West Darfur whose predecessor was killed in May 2023 after accusing the RSF of committing genocide.",
      "It was his first interview since 2023, and he maintained he was a neutral civilian during the el-Geneina unrest and did not side with anyone.",
      "\"We have turned a new page with the slogan of peace, coexistence, moving beyond the bitterness of the past,\" he said, adding that the UN's casualty figures were \"exaggerated\".",
      "Also in the room was a man who we understood to be a representative of the RSF.",
      "Karshoum's answers to nearly all my questions were almost identical, whether I was asking about accusations of ethnic cleansing or about what happened to the former governor, Khamis Abakar.",
      "Nearly two weeks after I spoke to Karshoum, the European Union imposed sanctions on him, saying he \"holds responsibility in the fatal attack\" on his predecessor and that he had \"been involved in planning, directing or committing\u2026 serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including killings, rape and other serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence, and abduction\".",
      "I followed up with him to get his response to these accusations, and he said: \"Since I am a suspect in this matter, I believe any statement from me would lack credibility.\"",
      "But he stated that he \"was never part of the tribal conflict and remained at home during the clashes\" and added that he was not involved in any violations of humanitarian law.",
      "\"Accusations of killings, abductions, or rape must be addressed through an independent investigation\" with which he would co-operate, Karshoum said.",
      "\"From the start of the conflict in Khartoum, we pushed for peace and proposed well-known initiatives to prevent violence in our socially fragile state,\" he added.",
      "Given the stark contrast between the narrative promoted by those in control of el-Geneina and the countless stories I heard from refugees across the border, it is hard to imagine people ever returning home.",
      "The same goes for 12 million other Sudanese people who have fled their homes and are either refugees abroad or living in camps inside Sudan.",
      "In the end, Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel found life in el-Fasher unbearable and in November 2024 all three left the city to stay in nearby towns.",
      "With the military regaining control of the capital, Khartoum, in March, Darfur remains the last major region where the paramilitaries are still largely in control - and that has turned el-Fasher into an even more intense battlefield.",
      "\"El-Fasher has become scary,\" Manahel said as she packed her belongings.",

      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",
      "This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.",
      "In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.",
      "Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.",
      "This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.",
      "The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.",
      "However, there is a big problem now.",
      "The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

    "summary": "As Cate Blanchett considers giving up acting, we take a look at other stars who quit the profession.",
    "story": [
      "Actress Cate Blanchett has said she wants to quit acting to do other things, joining a long line of big Hollywood stars who gave up the red carpets for a different lifestyle.",
      "The 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen.",
      "\"My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,\" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. \"[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\"",
      "Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.",
      "\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"",
      "Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.",
      "Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.",
      "She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):",
      "1. Cameron Diaz",
      "The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.",
      "Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.",
      "But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"",
      "She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.",
      "2. Daniel Day-Lewis",
      "The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.",
      "Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.",
      "Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.",
      "He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.",
      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men, Batman and The Departed.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",
      "But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened?",
      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",
      "Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills.",
      "\"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People.",
      "\"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance.",
      "10. Ke Huy Quan",
      "Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?",
      "He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies.",
      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",
      "He reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

The brain becomes unable to control muscle movement, and people eventually lose their ability to speak, eat, move and breathe, according to the\u00a0ALS Association. About 1 in 300 Americans are affected by ALS, Brian Frederick, senior vice president of communication at the ALS Association, told CBS News in August 2023.",
      "Experts don't know the exact cause of ALS. About 5% to 10% of cases appear to have a genetic link, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Most cases are sporadic, the NIH said. The average life expectancy with the disease is 2 to 5 years. Most patients die from respiratory failure, the NIH said. The condition has no cure.",
      "\"It can strike anyone at any time and is always fatal,\" Frederick said.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 16:52:43 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "The CDC also released a statement, noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

    "story": [
      "The Chinese government has told the country's domestic airlines to stop accepting deliveries of Boeing jets as a trade war between the world's two largest economies escalates, Bloomberg News\u00a0reports.",
      "China is also instructing its carriers to stop buying airline parts and other components from U.S. companies, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the situation.",
      "Boeing declined to comment. The aviation giant's shares fell $2.59, or 1.6%, to $156.74 in morning trading.",
      "The order to stop accepting Boeing jets comes after China boosted its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports, although those taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products. China's tariffs would have more than doubled the price of U.S.-made aircraft and parts, making the cost unaffordable, Bloomberg reported.",
      "Boeing is scheduled to ship about 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines, Air China and Xiamen Airlines, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Aviation Flights Group. During the first quarter, Boeing delivered 130 aircraft in all, including more than 100 737 jets, the company\u00a0said on April 8.",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the report in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, writing that China \"just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will 'not take possession' of fully committed to aircraft.\"",
      "Bloomberg reported that some of the payment and delivery paperwork on some of those jets ordered by Chinese airlines might have been completed before the trade war expanded earlier this month. In that case, some planes might be able to enter China, the news service reported.",

    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:21:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",

      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",

    "summary": "President Trump is considering exempting U.S. automakers from paying steep tariffs that could damage the industry.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday suggested he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector\u00a0to give carmakers time to overhaul their complex supply chains.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office that automakers \"need a little bit of time\" to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere to the U.S.",
      "Car manufacturers' supply chains are tightly interwoven with other nations, making it almost impossible to make vehicles entirely in the United States.",
      "Because U.S. automakers source many of their car parts from key trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and China, a fully American-made car doesn't exist, according to experts.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously reversed course on tariffs, causing upheaval in financial markets and leading economists to raise the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year.",
      "The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars, which Mr. Trump designed with the intention of reshoring auto manufacturing to the U.S., is likely to boost car prices by thousands of dollars, experts say.",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives."

    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:24 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,410\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 8-11, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "After one of the most turbulent weeks on Wall Street in recent history, stocks ended higher on Friday, with investors setting aside concerns \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 about the growing trade war between the U.S. and China.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",
      "After a week full of monstrous swings, the S&P 500 posted its best weekly performance since November 23, while the Nasdaq saw its best week since November 2022, according to the financial data firm FactSet. Even so, economists are cautioning that the growing trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp the nation's growth.",
      "\"'Rollercoaster' is not a technical term but it is probably the best adjective to describe price action across equity markets this week,\" noted Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in an email.",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",
      "Pressure also eased a bit from within the U.S. bond market. The typically more boring corner of Wall Street has been flashing signals of stress this week that have been serious enough to demand attention from both Wall Street and President Trump.",
      "\"China's tit-for-tat retaliation in its rapidly escalating trade war with the U.S. exerted some renewed pressure on equities and the dollar today, with bonds still buffeted by expectations of monetary easing and signs of market dislocation,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Gold prices rose more than 2% to $3,250 per ounce Friday following China's tariff hike as investors crowd into safe havens.",
      "The S&P 500 remains down nearly 13% from its latest peak on Feb. 19, while the Dow and Nasdaq have fallen 12% and 17%, respectively.",
      "Those declines reflect investor concerns about the impact of multilateral tariffs on corporate profits and on the broader economy, with some analysts raising the odds of a recession.",
      "\"While the White House has tried hard in the last 1.5 days to spin things positively on trade, with a lot of talk about negotiations, investors are seeing through the noise and realize the irreparable damage inflicted on the global economy from Trump's reckless tariff campaign,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",

      "Despite Mr. Trump's move this week to ratchet down trade tensions, Americans seem worried. New data from the University of Michigan shows consumer confidence sinking to its lowest level since the depths of the pandemic, with more people expecting unemployment to rise.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website. The company does not indicate what kind of price hikes it could implement in the future, though, as a result of the new levies.",

      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, also decried the tariffs this week,\u00a0saying\u00a0on social media Sunday that \"we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "CBS has lost distribution rights to \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!,\" with a Los Angeles court rejecting the network's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked Sony from taking over.",
      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. Specifically, the entertainment company claimed CBS licensed the shows at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenue, among other alleged contract violations (CBS News and CBS are owned by Paramount Global.)",
      "After accusing CBS of breaching its contract, Sony in February assumed distribution. In response, CBS sought, and was granted, a restraining order, which allowed the network to retain distribution rights to the programs.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:45:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

The company, co-owned by Karen Sadaka and Teddy Sadaka, works with brands including Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole, but most of its plants have shut down as garment jobs were shipped overseas.",
      "\"We had factories in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky,\" Karen Sadaka said. \"It wasn't a problem. Today, they're all out of business.\"",
      "Today, the average age of workers at Apparel Production is 50, and filling those jobs when they retire is likely to prove challenging. Sadaka said it is too son to tell if Mr. Trump's tariffs will spur domestic production, but she fears the shift \"is too much, too fast.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "A man accused of trying to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club last September can hire an expert to examine the rifle recovered from the scene, but only to determine its operability, a federal judge said Tuesday.",
      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",
      "Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and two firearm charges. His federal trial is scheduled for September, and he's expected to face additional state charges.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump \u2014 then a presidential candidate \u2014 for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before the president came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged last week\u00a0Routh also tried to buy an anti-aircraft weapon online to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane. \"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh allegedly told an associate from whom he hoped to buy the weapon.",

    "summary": "Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested Monday at a citizenship interview in Vermont \u2014 one day after telling CBS News he'd \"accept the outcome.\"",
    "story": [
      "Just one day before Mohsen Mahdawi was detained by immigration agents at what he was told was his citizenship interview, the Columbia student and Palestinian activist told CBS News he thought there was a chance the long-awaited appointment could be a trap.",
      "\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mahdawi \u2014 a native of the Israeli-occupied West Bank who has held a green card for the last decade \u2014 told CBS News on the eve of his detention. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"",
      "Mahdawi was taken into custody after arriving at his interview in Vermont on Monday. CBS News witnessed federal agents strapping on vests shortly after he walked into the building, emerging about an hour later with Mahdawi in handcuffs.",
      "His attorneys say he was detained under a little-used law allowing foreign nationals to be deported if they pose \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" \u2014 making him the latest student to face detention, including fellow Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's legal team has petitioned a judge to release him and alleged he is being punished for protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment and his right to due process.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's detention, federal Judge William Sessions ordered the Trump administration not to deport him or move him out of the state of Vermont while Sessions reviews the case, granting a request from Mahdawi's attorneys.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment to the State Department, which declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi \u2014 who says he was set to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in May \u2014 co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023 along with Khalil. Mahdawi was later active in protests on Columbia's campus against Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas' terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. His attorneys said in a court filing that Mahdawi \"took a step back\" from organizing the protests in March 2024, before the protests escalated later that spring, with demonstrators forming encampments and occupying a campus building.",
      "The nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests was a political lightning rod, with critics arguing the demonstrations \u2014 and their leaders \u2014 were disruptive and featured antisemitic rhetoric. Columbia is one of several schools to face a freeze in federal funding by the Trump administration, which alleges the Ivy League school \"failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\"",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News last weekend he faced \"threats\" and \"intimidation\" after speaking about the protests in a late 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview. Shortly after President Trump took office, he also drew the attention of Betar USA, a controversial pro-Israel group that tweeted in January that Mahdawi was on its \"deport list.\"",
      "The group's former Executive Director Ross Glick told CBS News that Betar USA has collected information on thousands of pro-Palestinian activists and passed it on to the Trump administration. He said it's up to the government to decide whether somebody actually supports Hamas: \"Once information is handed off, we're out of the process, right? It's ultimately up to the government, the various officials.\"",
      "Mahdawi pushed back on Betar's criticism, saying groups like Betar \"manipulate information, create lies, and attach them to the profiles of those either students or activists.\" Mahdawi has vehemently denied claims of antisemitism in the Columbia University protests more generally, calling them a \"false accusation.\"",
      "He also told CBS News over the weekend that if he's detained by federal agents, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "After Khalil was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month, Mahdawi feared he could be ensnared next. Khalil is currently held in Louisiana, and his legal future is uncertain: An immigration judge ruled last week the Trump administration can move forward with deportation but gave his lawyers until late April to file applications for relief. His lawyers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, and they are separately suing the government for his release.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he began taking precautions for his own safety, including avoiding public spaces, after Khalil's detention. Still, when he received word of a citizenship appointment, he chose to attend \u2014 though he suspected it may lead to his detention.",
      "\"It's an irony. The irony of destiny. And I accept the outcome,\" Mahdawi said a day beforehand. \"If my story will become another story for the struggle to have justice and democracy in this country, let it be.\"",

      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis had ordered the Justice Department to provide her with answers to those questions after the Supreme Court last week unanimously affirmed a portion of an earlier order that required the U.S. to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "summary": "Under a program known as CHNV, migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration can't immediately revoke the deportation protections and work permits of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden-era program, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to terminate the legal status of those migrants on April 24. The administration had warned those affected by its announcement that they would need to self deport by that date or face arrest and deportation by federal immigration agents.",
      "But Talwani suspended the deportation warnings the government had sent and prohibited officials from revoking the legal protection, known as immigration parole, that the Biden administration granted to more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Talwani said those mass parole terminations could not happen without each case being reviewed.",
      "The \"early termination, without any case-by-case justification, of legal status for noncitizens who have complied with DHS programs and entered the country lawfully undermines the rule of law,\" wrote Talwani, who sits on the federal district court in Boston.",
      "Monday's ruling is a significant reprieve for those who arrived under a policy the Biden administration argued promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border unlawfully.",
      "Under that program, known as CHNV, a total of 532,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals. Upon entry, they were granted immigration parole and allowed to work in the U.S. lawfully for two years.",
      "Biden administration officials partially credited the policy for a sharp reduction in illegal border crossings by migrants from the four countries whose citizens were eligible to be sponsored. But the program was not implemented without controversy.",
      "Republican-led states challenged the policy's legality in federal court, arguing that the parole authority did not grant the federal government the power to admit such large numbers of foreigners through a program with broad eligibility rules.",
      "The Biden administration paused the initiative for several weeks in 2024 due to concerns about fraudulent applications. It also declined to allow those who arrived under the policy to renew their parole beyond the two-year period, saying they could seek other benefits, like asylum or temporary protected status, to remain in the U.S.",
      "The CHNV policy was paused immediately after President Trump returned to the White House in January. His administration quickly took steps to dismantle parole-based immigration policies, which it argued exceeded the president's authority. Trump administration officials have also argued those allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV initiative were not properly vetted.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would give CHNV beneficiaries 30 days to leave the U.S. voluntarily, or it would seek their arrest and removal from the country. Officials said they would prioritize the arrest of migrants who had failed to apply for another immigration benefit, like asylum or a green card.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin denounced the CHNV policy, claiming it \"unleashed over 530,000 poorly vetted aliens into America, fueling crime and stealing jobs \u2014 forcing our agents in the field to ignore rampant fraud.\"",
      "\"While this ruling delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary (Kristi) Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos, prioritizing the safety of Americans,\" McLaughlin added.",
      "The ruling is another legal setback for the Trump administration and its effort to discontinue Biden administration immigration programs that protect hundreds of thousands of migrants from deportation.",
      "Late last month, a federal judge in California prevented the administration from ending a Temporary Protected Status policy that shields more than 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. from deportation.",

      "President Trump issued a new threat to Harvard University on Tuesday after the federal government froze $2.2 billion in grant funding for the institution, suggesting that the Ivy League school \"should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity.\"",
      "The president's latest statement came after the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution announced Monday that it will reject a list of demands from the Trump administration governing the school's policies and leadership. Harvard is the latest university to be targeted by the Trump administration, which is using federal funding as leverage to try to change internal governance at universities and how they manage student expression on campus.",
      "\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"",
      "Nearly all public and private colleges in the United States are exempt from paying taxes because they are educational organizations, according to the Association of American Universities.",
      "Harvard rejects Trump's demands",
      "The conflict between some universities and the Trump administration stems from pro-Palestinian encampments that grew at Harvard Yard and on other college campuses last year. The Trump administration said at the end of March it was reviewing about $9 billion in grants with Harvard as it investigates alleged antisemitic incidents at colleges.",
      "A letter\u00a0the Trump administration sent Harvard on April 11 demanded several changes, including leadership reforms at the school and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Harvard President Alan Garber responded by saying the university \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\"",
      "\"I think so many of us want to work at a place and be part of a community that stands up for its principles, right?\" Harvard political science professor Ryan Enos said. \"If you don't have that, you don't have anything.\"",

      "\"It's not just that things have been stopped cold, which a lot of it has,\" Enos said. \"One day, they're doing research and then the next day they can't. It's also the fact that they can't plan.\"",
      "But Shabbos Kestenbaum, who received his master's degree from Harvard and campaigned for Mr. Trump, says this sort of penalty on the university is long overdue.",
      "\"What the federal government is doing is saying, 'You have a track record of discrimination, you have a track record of violating the civil rights of your own students, and we're not going to fund this,'\" he said. \"Harvard is trying to, you know, have its cake and eat it too.\"",
      "With Harvard reporting an endowment of more than $53 billion last year, some critics may wonder why the school needs federal funding at all.",
      "\"There is some truth to that, of course. That's why it's important for Harvard to fight,\" Enos said. \"They're sort of digging in for battle, and we all have to prepare to go through that now.\"",

      "Officials said Cody Balmer, 38, hopped a fence and intentionally set a fire at the residence early on Sunday, April 13, while Shapiro and his family were home. Balmer, of Harrisburg, was charged Monday with criminal homicide/attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and more.",
      "Balmer was arraigned on the charges on Monday evening, and a judge denied bail. Earlier Monday, Pennsylvania State Police said Balmer was treated at a hospital for a \"medical event not related to this incident or his arrest.\" He was taken into custody on Sunday in the Harrisburg area.",

When we were in the State Dining Room last night, gathered with the community and family and friends, we told the story of Passover, and it's a story of going from bondage, from slavery, into freedom. I think it's an important story, both literally and figuratively, to tell, and I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us, as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love, stop me from being a leader of this commonwealth and looking out for all Pennsylvanians.

      "But internal disagreements over that policy manifested well before that, with leaders offering predictions of serious economic instability, multiple sources familiar with the exchanges told CBS News.",
      "One argument took place between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in chief of staff Susie Wiles' office in late March, in the days before Mr. Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs were announced.",
      "The following account is from multiple sources familiar with the meeting. Navarro wanted 25% across-the-board tariffs on all $3 trillion of imported goods. Bessent, who made a career as a Wall Street investor, warned of market turmoil and outlined various scenarios.",
      "Heated words flew.",
      "Navarro sneered: \"You're doing the same thing they did in the first term. Don't pull this. Don't be him.\"",
      "Advisers in the room later told people close to them that they interpreted that to mean don't be like then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or then-economic adviser Gary Cohn, both former Goldman Sachs executives who served in the first Trump administration and pushed back against hardline tariffs ideas.",
      "Spokespeople for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the spat.",
      "Navarro told CBS News: \"Fake news from malevolent anonymous sources. Scottie and I don't argue. We think things through.\"",
      "In other internal debates before the Rose Garden announcement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that certain tariffs could cause global disaster.",
      "Bessent on multiple occasions pushed for a calculated rollout with more targeted tariffs than what Navarro pushed.",
      "Elon Musk, the administration's top government efficiency adviser, was not part of key decision meetings on the tariffs. Musk was careful to not broadcast his strong disdain for certain aspects of the tariff policy except in very small circles, although some of that eventually emerged in criticism of Navarro on social media. Musk also publicly advocated for zero tariffs between the United States and the European Union.",
      "Navarro maintained that there should be no negotiations \u2014 the tariffs should be left in place to generate revenue and to muscle manufacturers into domestic production.",
      "But in the days after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement, financial markets reeled, proving correct some of Trump's advisers' predictions. Trillions of dollars were erased from the major stock indexes and the bond market sent alarming signals. Wall Street investment firms like Goldman Sachs predicted higher odds of recession and some of America's top CEOs publicly expressed their concerns.",
      "In an interview on the morning of April 9, America's top banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Maria Bartiromo that a recession was \"a likely outcome.\"",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on CNBC that the turmoil was \"self-inflicted,\" and announced that the company was suspending its full year guidance given the \"uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty.\"",
      "The same morning, Mr. Trump attempted to reassure investors and executives and posted: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well.\"",
      "By the afternoon, with input from Bessent and Lutnick, Mr. Trump opened a pressure release valve and paused some of the tariffs for 90 days.",
      "\"Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They were getting yippy \u2014 you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man involved in protests at Columbia University, was taken into custody by federal agents Monday when he arrived at a citizenship interview in Vermont, his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "Mahdawi's detention comes as the Trump administration fights to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
      "Mahdawi's legal team told CBS News federal agents informed them the Trump administration detained Mahdawi under an obscure law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State decides someone poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The administration cited the same provision to detain Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers filed a petition in court asking for his release, claiming his detention violated the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\" his attorney, Luna Droubi, alleged in a statement. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News' request for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Mahdawi's attorney Luna Droubi said in a statement Mahdawi's legal team has \"not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him.\" Federal Judge William Sessions temporarily barred the government from removing Mahdawi from Vermont on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi was born in a West Bank refugee camp and has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade, according to his lawyers. He completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year, and was expected to graduate in May before seeking a master's degree from the university this fall.",
      "Khalil and Mahdawi co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023, Mahdawi's lawyers said in court documents. Khalil later spoke at campus protests over Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, which began after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Mahdawi has drawn attention in the past. Betar USA \u2014 a controversial pro-Israel group that regularly encourages the Trump administration to detain pro-Palestinian protest leaders \u2014 tweeted a video of Mahdawi in January and said he's on the organization's \"deport list.\"",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told CBS News in a statement the group has \"provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump Administration of visitors to America who support Hamas and will continue to.\"",
      "Mahdawi's lawyers say he has backed a \"peaceful political solution\" to the Palestinian conflict. In a 2023 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Mahdawi told Bill Whitaker about a campus rally during which an unidentified person yelled an antisemitic statement. Mahdawi said he was \"shocked\" and told the person, \"you don't represent us.\"",
      "Mahdawi is the latest student to face immigration detention. Khalil, who also holds a green card, was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month. The government is seeking his removal from the country, accusing him of supporting Hamas and participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" When asked to provide evidence for Khalil's detention, the government cited a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that said that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives but did not provide any evidence of Khalil declaring support for Hamas.",
      "Tufts University\u00a0student\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk was detained weeks later, with her attorneys claiming she was targeted for co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper.",
      "Khalil and Ozturk are both detained in Louisiana. A federal immigration judge ruled last week the government can move forward with its push to deport Khalil, but he has until later this month to seek relief from deportation. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal, and he's separately suing over his detention. Ozturk is also suing for her release, and her attorneys faced off against the Trump administration in a hearing Monday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the practice of revoking visas, writing on X after Khalil's arrest, \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

    "summary": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said \"of course I'm not going to do it\" about returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to an El Salvadoran prison.",
    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives in\u00a0Maryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. An\u00a0analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"",
      "\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"",
      "Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,\u00a0Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",

With the Marine Corps Band's rendition of Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" still blaring in the background, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was standing next to Vance, swiftly recovered the fumble.",
      "Vance later shrugged off the near-turnover, posting on X, \"I didn't want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.\"",
      "The moment came after Vance and President Trump spoke at the celebration, flanked by Ohio State players and coaches. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame 34-23 in the title game on Jan. 20 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In a set of brief remarks, Mr. Trump congratulated the Buckeyes on their victory and praised the state of Ohio more generally: \"We won that state in a landslide.\"",
      "Vance talked up the team, but also took a moment to needle Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The two agreed to a friendly wager on an Ohio State-University of Texas playoff game earlier this year, with the loser agreeing to wear the winning team's jersey and drop off food and beer from their home state \u2014 a bet Vance claimed Cruz has \"still not paid up on.\"",
      "\"I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz,\" Vance said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Vermont considered Monday whether to release a Tufts University Ph.D. student as she challenges her detention as a violation of her free speech rights.",
      "Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at the Massachusetts university, was detained by immigration authorities last month outside of her apartment because her student visa had been revoked. The Trump administration has said hundreds of students studying at American universities have had their visas taken away or were stopped from reentering the United States after they were accused of publicly expressing support for Palestinians.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys argue that her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and are seeking to have her either released on bail or, as an alternative, transferred to Vermont from Louisiana. She is currently detained at a federal immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Jessie Rossman, one of Ozturk's lawyers, told U.S. District Judge William Sessions during a hearing that the \"sole basis\" of Ozturk's arrest was an editorial she co-authored in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its handling of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate in an effort to \"hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\"",
      "Ozturk's attorneys also argued that the government's decision to transport Ozturk across three states \u2014 Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont \u2014 before she was sent to Louisiana was unusual and designed to punish Ozturk for protected speech.",
      "\"This was done to chill her speech and send a clear, chilling message to everyone watching,\" Rossman said, adding that the government knew the public was paying attention. \"If you engage in speech that the administration disagrees with, you will be punished.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's case under federal immigration law, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has initiated removal proceedings against her. Michael Drescher, a Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk must seek release through the immigration courts.",
      "\"Congress has been crystal clear on that,\" he said, adding that she can seek review of an adverse decision from a Board of Immigration Appeals from a federal appeals court.",
      "Sessions and the government engaged in a debate over the scope of habeas jurisdiction \u2014 which allows courts to review the legality of a person's detention \u2014 and discussed whether the court has the authority to consider Ozturk's detention amid ongoing removal proceedings, as well as whether her petition named the proper immigration officials.",
      "The judge suggested that if the court found a constitutional violation but was told it lacked the authority to order her release due to an immigration detention order, it could create a troubling legal conflict.",
      "\"Then we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Sessions warned.",
      "Sessions noted that the case stands at the intersection of immigration law and a detainee's right to challenge the legality of their confinement.",
      "\"The Constitution rubs up against the [Immigration and Nationalities Act] perhaps in some areas but fundamentally, the court's responsibility is to make an assessment about constitutional liberties and if there is a constitutional violation here, certainly that takes precedence,\" he said.",
      "Noor Zafar, a lawyer for Ozturk, argued she is not contesting the executive branch's authority to exercise its discretion to detain people pending their removal from the U.S., but rather the basis for Ozturk's detention.",
      "Zafar said the circumstances surrounding Ozturk's detention are \"extraordinary,\" as immigration authorities made the decision to take her into custody in retaliation for her speech.",
      "The judge did not decide immediately whether to grant the government's request to dismiss Ozturk's habeas petition, or order her returned to Vermont from Louisiana. But he raised the prospect of bringing Ozturk back to Vermont for a bail hearing while he addresses her constitutional challenge to her detention.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers also argued that the existing record is sufficient to make a determination on bail, and said that the government has had multiple opportunities to present evidence against allowing her to be released while her case proceeds, but has failed to do so. Her legal team said that there is no reason to believe the government would present new evidence to counter their case, which would demonstrate that Ozturk has met the necessary bail requirements.",
      "Drescher, in response, referred back to the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that the law presents limits for a court to release the petitioner on bail.",
      "\"There is a legitimate question as to whether the INA would permit such a release,\" he argued.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, one of Ozturk's attorneys, told CBS Boston on Sunday that it's \"pretty clear, based on the lack of evidence that the government has submitted, that she's done anything that's violated our immigration laws.\"",
      "\"It's essentially just trying to silence and show everyone from speaking out and creating basically this, you know, Soviet-style era of watch your neighbor and report on what your neighbor is doing to us,\" Khanbabi said.",
      "Ozturk's case arose after she was arrested by immigration agents outside of her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment before attending an iftar dinner. She was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, according to court filings. From there, she was brought to an ICE field office in St. Albans, Vermont, and was held there overnight. The following morning, on March 26, Ozturk was taken to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, and flown to Louisiana, where she was transferred to the immigration detention facility in Basile.",
      "During the hearing, Sessions scrutinized the timeline of events from when Ozturk was taken into custody to when she was flown to Louisiana. A federal judge in Massachusetts had issued an order on the night of March 25 \u2014 hours after Ozturk's arrest \u2014 that blocked the government from moving her out of the state.",
      "The judge said the Massachusetts court \"clearly expressed in a judicial order from an Article III judge\" a desire to maintain jurisdiction over Ozturk's case. That order, Sessions said, \"had no impact upon what ultimately happened to\" Ozturk, as she was transferred to Louisiana anyway.",
      "Drescher, the Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk was already in Vermont when that order was issued, which \"created complications\" of how to interpret and respond to it.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts emerged as a key question in the challenge to her detention, as the Justice Department has repeatedly sought to have her case transferred to Louisiana because it is where she is detained.",
      "Earlier this month, a Massachusetts judge rejected an earlier effort by the Justice Department to throw out the challenge to Ozturk's detention after she was first taken into custody, but moved the case to Vermont because it is where she was located when her lawyers filed a habeas petition contesting her confinement.",
      "Ozturk's attorney on Monday also referenced a Washington Post report filed with the court, which cited internal memos indicating that the State Department found no evidence linking Ozturk to antisemitic activity or support for terrorism. Those underlying memos have not yet been produced in court. CBS News reached out to the State Department for comment.",
      "In a separate filing last week, Ozturk, 30, detailed how she was detained by ICE. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "\"I felt very scared and concerned as the men surrounded me and grabbed my phone from me,\" Ozturk said in the statement, writing that the officers told her they were police, and one quickly showed what might have been a gold badge. \"But I didn't think they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,\" she said.",
      "She added that the officers did not tell her why they were arresting her, and that they repeatedly denied her requests to speak to an attorney.",

More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said Sunday that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping \"don't have any plans\" to speak amid an escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"Since April 2, we have this at the leaders level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them,\" Greer said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "In what Mr. Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, the president announced that the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, shortly after the tariffs went into effect, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs after U.S. and global financial markets plunged. At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.",
      "China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a \"joke.\"",
      "Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said \"the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.\"",
      "\"So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'\" Greer said. \"And the Chinese made a different decision \u2026 It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.\"",
      "The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is \"we've become so dependent on China\" and haven't had fair market access for decades.",
      "\"We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,\" Greer said, adding that \"we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.\"",
      "When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, \"because everyone knew tariffs were coming.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,\" Greer said.",

That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes.",
      "The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well.",
      "I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level.",
      "Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries.",
      "In the past, you've talked \u2013 you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan.",
      "President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans.",
      "And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a \u2013 it's not a brand-new development.",
      "You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so \u2013 so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well.",
      "So, it's not \u2013 it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips.",
      "Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them.",
      "Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States.",
      "What happened is \u2013 it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.",
      "So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is \u2013 that is subject to study by the Commerce Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption.\"",
      "Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8.",

      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret.",
      "We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we \u2013 we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera.",
      "They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced?",
      "I mean, he \u2013 he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What \u2013 what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have \u2013 for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's \u2013 that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026. investigations for those.",
      "No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're \u2013 you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that \u2013 and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of \u2013 of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current \u2013 including their currency.",
      "Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States.",
      "In the USMCA and in the Japan-China \u2013 the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term.",
      "The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has \u2013 has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition \u2013 you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a \u2013 we're in a nefarious situation.",
      "We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but \u2013 but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right?",
      "So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm \u2013 I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming.",
      "This was \u2013 this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers.",
      "I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I \u2013 I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see.",
      "I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president \u2013 I know you were testifying on \u2013 on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs.",
      "He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\"",
      "He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of \u2013 that type of discussion had been happening for \u2013 for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart.",
      "But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order.",
      "So \u2013 so lawyer \u2013 you know, trade lawyers like \u2013 like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's \u2013 forms the basis for these tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China.",
      "Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that.",
      "I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else.",
      "And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially.",
      "I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest.",
      "What makes you say that?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit.",
      "It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy.",
      "So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up.",
      "It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.",
      "So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America?",
      "You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility.",
      "We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy.",
      "And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what \u2013 yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries.",
      "And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you \u2013 what concerned you?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern.",
      "It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that.",
      "All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices.",
      "Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If \u2013 what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated.",
      "The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that.",
      "So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet.",
      "But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer.",
      "But, obviously, this is the biggest \u2013 in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy.",
      "And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession.",
      "Is the risk that high, in your estimate?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is \u2013 are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners?",
      "The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices.",
      "And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: They are.",
      "I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're \u2013 as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right?",
      "The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change.",
      "But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out.",
      "So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now.",
      "But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down.",
      "But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now.",
      "But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue.",
      "Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area.",
      "Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights.",
      "And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space.",
      "But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program.",
      "Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there.",
      "Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress.",
      "And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes.",
      "In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term.",
      "But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam.",
      "So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy.",
      "And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam.",
      "And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States.",
      "So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",

      "PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration.",
      "PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services.",
      "Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA?",
      "PETER MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.",
      "Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here.",
      "You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies.",
      "And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience -",

We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",

      "PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism.",

    "summary": "Dr. Peter Marks said that the deaths of unvaccinated children is \"just not acceptable.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's record outbreak of the virus.",
      "\"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Weekly measles cases have climbed to the highest levels seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.",
      "\"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.",
      "Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures \"includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do.\" He also said that \"even a single death in this country from measles, it's just\u2014 it's just not excusable.\"",
      "\"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles,\" said Marks.",
      "Changes at the FDA",
      "Before he was ousted by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.",
      "He warned that it is now \"challenging in this environment\" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.",
      "\"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks,\" Marks said.",
      "Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented steep layoffs and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies.",
      "The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over how to prioritize fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as \"heroes in public health\" who are \"struggling because there's a lot to be done.\"",
      "\"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can,\" Marks said.",
      "Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.",
      "\"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health,\" Marks said.",
      "\"Does a disservice to pseudoscience\"",
      "Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the cause of autism.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's claim that \"we know it is an environmental toxin\" causing autism, Marks said it was \"very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes.\" Kennedy has been criticized for years for claiming that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.",
      "\"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit,\" he said.",
      "Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism,\" Marks said.",
      "Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience \"does a disservice to pseudoscience,\" Marks said.",
      "David Geier was fined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for sex offenders.",
      "\"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea,\" said Marks.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday, the President authorized the US military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REP. KHANNA: We have not. And Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would nine to zero rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego was unconstitutional, but we have not heard any specific- specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, there, were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. The Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the- Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here, and the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know, and he does actually have legal rights. And so similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the President of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding armed services, we understand that the President sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much other than they're going to meet again, but in the meantime, the US military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Iran- Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Absolutely, and almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We- they need to come to Congress. And look, the President was elected by the American people saying we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him, that does not want more of these strikes with- in the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost 10 years, and though it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The President campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't done that, and what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you, why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning? I understand in the coming days, you're also going to go to Connecticut to Yale Law on Tuesday. Are you trying to, sort of, troll vice president Vance? And if so, why?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, no, I mean, Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy and- let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic, and they were totally haphazard. So you had Howard Lutnick on, saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back and- electronics manufacturing back to the United States, and they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to 1700 or 2000 dollars. And by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So they suddenly reverse. They exempt all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the CHIPS Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The President has no plan of how to actually have high end advanced manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying- apparently successfully, to get these carve outs.",
      "REP. KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean, it really would have been- they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the President's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First, they're saying that Howard Lutnick the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1% of an iPhone's cost. I mean, you need to- the actual components or memory or camera or RAM. I mean, it's like, I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, okay, you really want to do this. The iPhone will cost 16 to 1,700 dollars but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India, we'll go to Malaysia, we'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And I saw the poll earlier. This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the President will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come or we're not, and tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when the semiconductor tariffs are coming, but the administration argues they're in the pipeline, and that, you know, China is not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it's- again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the CHIPS Act. So how are you going to- let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of Asia. It still isn't going to come here, unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy, and that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Peter Marks, former head of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined by Dr. Peter Marks, who recently resigned as the FDA's top vaccine regulator. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "DR. PETER MARKS: Thanks so much for having me today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about a number of things, but let's talk about one of the most immediate problems, and that is this measles outbreak. The CDC has now recommended additional measles shots for people traveling within the U.S., specifically to the states of Kansas and Texas due to record outbreaks. The guidance wasn't on the website, but it was told to local authorities, what do you make of that public health guidance?",
      "DR. MARKS: What I make of that is that we have enough spread of measles and some uncertainty in people's vaccination status that they're trying to make sure that people are as protected as they can be. Some people who were vaccinated, for instance, for a period in the early 60s, they may not be fully vaccinated in the extent that the vaccine was not as good back then. So sometimes we ask them to get revaccinated and additionally, some people don't know their vaccination status. So better to be safe than to put yourself at risk, because it is a very- it's one of the safer vaccines that we have. In fact, it is possibly characterized as among the safest vaccines that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The MMR vaccine.",
      "DR. MARKS: The MMR vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just said something interesting. You said the- the composition of the shot was different years ago, the quality of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: It- it was- right, well, it was the quality of the shot that was being given, the potency, that's the strength of it. For a period of time for a few years in the early 60s was such that there are generally people in the period between about 1957 and 1967 if they got vaccinated against measles, they may want to ask their doctor if they should be revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I focus in on that, because the HHS Secretary said that the measles vaccine quote \"wanes,\" that was the word he used in effectiveness 4.5 percent each year, and that older people are essentially unvaccinated and unprotected. That's slightly different from what you're saying. Is what he characterized correct, because it does sound like you're saying older Americans might want to look into this.",
      "DR. MARKS: Older Americans- so first of all, if you were born before 1957 it's unlikely that you have to worry about this, because you almost certainly had the measles like I did. I wasn't born before 1957 but I had the measles just the same, okay. But if you were born before 1957 we don't worry about measles vaccination because it's assumed that people had the measles, and natural measles infection gives one pretty robust lifetime immunity. There's a period between 1957, 1967 some people say 1963, but to be generous we'll say 1967, when if you got the measles vaccine, you might want to check with your doctor. And then, since that time, though, the newer version of the measles vaccine, as long as you've had two doses of that vaccine, it's generally considered to provide lifetime protection, and we don't generally see people later in life getting measles. I mean, it's true, there are people who have immunocompromising conditions that may need to be revaccinated later in life. But in general, if you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, one doesn't need to get revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two doses, it's not wearing off is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- well\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not waning?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- it's not- so let's- let's be clear, many vaccines, the protection wanes over time, but there's a threshold effect, and as long as you're above that threshold in terms of protection, you're safe. And so by and large, when people have had two doses of the existing MMR vaccine that's used in the United States, they maintain, for all intents and purposes, lifetime immunity against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook earlier this week, following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position philosophically of the federal government in terms of public health?",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: The federal Government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine, but if- the government should not be mandating those\u2013",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: Understand, but the\u2013",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: \u2013 I always said during my campaign and in every part, every public statement I've made: I'm not gonna take people's vaccines away from them. What I'm gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I'm not going to comment to that, but I'm going to tell you as a public health professional. I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now, and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading in this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There's no reason to put your child at that risk, because the vaccine does not cause death, it does not cause encephalitis and it does not cause autism. So a vaccine that is safe, yes, occasionally kids get fevers. If you don't keep the fevers down, about 15 in 100,000 will get a convulsion that happens once it goes away. But if you take their temperatures, keep it down, that's unlikely. And the other four or five side effects per 100,000 are ones that come and go. So, very safe vaccine that is going to potentially protect your child and save its life. And there's just- the issue here is we should love our children enough that if you care about your child, just like you'd strap them in that car seat, you're going to get them vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine. They will be well protected against this. Once you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, it's virtually unheard of that a child dies of measles. Three or four percent may get the measles, but it's not a life threatening illness, so it's really important to get vaccinated. Get your child vaccinated if you need to, you have questions, ask your pediatrician, ask your health care provider. If you have religious objections or issues, go to your clergy member, because most major religions actually understand how important vaccination is, and they will go ahead and tell you that it's okay to get vaccinated. So that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you. As someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long, you clearly feel that this is safe and effective, and that not saying it clearly is endangering people",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Am I understanding--",
      "DR. MARKS: So another way. Yes, No, exactly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your frustration?",
      "DR. MARKS: Exactly. But there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing- I mean, if you saw a child, if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the backseat of a car, you'd probably call Child Protective Services. Now, I'm not saying we should have, we should order parents to do this, because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates, but we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. Just this week, we now have additional states that have been declared as outbreak states. That means they have at least three cases of measles in them. There are now seven states, the epicenter being obviously Texas, but now Indiana has an outbreak. Ohio has an outbreak. So you can see these are places that are very concerning, particularly because Ohio, Pennsylvania, these are states that have Amish populations, that typically have vaccination rates that are can be as low as in the low 20% range.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA.",
      "DR. MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question. They can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine, right now?",
      "DR. MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, in your resignation letter, you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "DR. MARKS: So just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't, I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that.its administration can have me come and go. That's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country, and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years, and now we're seeing the result of this. By the way, it's not just measles. We had two deaths in Louisiana from whooping cough, which is caused by pertussis. Again, these are deaths that in under vaccinated or unvaccinated populations, we don't need to be seeing. And I don't buy the idea that we need to take a break from infectious diseases to deal with chronic diseases. We can do both. We are a great nation, and we should be able to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is the current stated policy of the secretary. What you just said, looking more at chronic.",
      "DR. MARKS: You'll have to say whether it is or not. I can just tell you that, from my perspective, I think we have a broad enough public health enterprise to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you seem to be saying there, and I think it gets to the core of what scientists do is you're dealing in fact, and you are constantly questioning the evolution of the science and adjusting conclusions you need to be able to take in information. You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind and those of us who believe in it, we we take it very seriously, and it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science, because It's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just, it's not okay, because at the end of the day, I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child that I actually, actually used profanity with a reporter without while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I just- people who know me know that just I try to avoid it, and it just showed me how badly I was affected. Because even one death, even a single death in this country from measles, it's just it's not excusable. It's not, and a second death. And I really, I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated. Because my experience--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Mennonite community.",
      "DR. MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. Because in generally, in every religious community, you eventually find someone who understands that part of that religious belief is that you don't harm those who can't help themselves. We are as adults, can take care of our children. And I think I don't have any problem of working on the faith level with people and telling them, look, you know, if you- let me try to answer all your medical questions, and if you're still left with faith issues that you know that you feel like God will provide for your child. Well, guess what, God provided me. I know about science. Science has provided us with these vaccines that can save your child's life. God helps those who help themselves. So we have to, we have to communicate better. I'm not- I'm the first to acknowledge that over the course of the past years, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic, we could have communicated better as scientists. So you're not going to get any arguments with- from me on that. But right now, with this crisis, there is no reason why we should not as a country be making a full court press to get our measles vaccination rates above 90%, because otherwise we're not going to get this under control. And for those who can't, for those who really don't care about little babies dying or children dying, I'll tell you what will happen too, once we lose measles elimination status, we will then be forced, potentially, when we go overseas, to places in Europe which have achieved elimination status, we'll have to show little yellow cards showing that we have either immunity or been vaccinated against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Those little vaccination passports\u2013",
      "DR. MARKS: Right, those little passports yeah. Now, but, but, I mean, I'm, I'm embarrassed to even use that as a reason, because I couldn't care less. What I really care about is the fact that along the way of getting there, we will have more deaths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I appreciate everything you're laying out there. I want to talk to you about some of what happened during COVID as well, but to follow up on- particularly the MMR vaccine. You know where I'm going next, the allegations of that specific vaccine and links to autism. Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge- very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There's no established cause, but yesterday- on Thursday, the HHS Secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic, and we'll be- we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "DR. MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being going on to try to relook at prior autism research, but I'm not aware of what is being discussed there. And I would just say the following- so I'm somebody who in my career as a physician taking care of patients- and there are people probably who are hearing me now who know that I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely- you can be incredibly supportive of people, but giving them false hope is wrong--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Can you--",
      "DR. MARKS: Unless someone- unless somebody actually knows the answer or has a pretty good idea of the answer right now, or thinks they have a good idea of the answer, I don't see how one could have- as a scientist, I'm not speaking about anything. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer that quickly? I don't see any possible way. And remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue, so we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true- how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying- just to be clear here, because you hear Secretary Kennedy often compare rates now to when he was a child. What you are saying is that the broad array of things under that ASD umbrella has only widened, so it was a much narrower category than what it is now.",
      "DR. MARKS: Right. And I'm not denying that there could be environmental- and we know there are probably genetic features, there have been publications in scientific journals. There are genetic and environmental possibilities here, but the totality of all these interactions and sorting out this incredible complexity, to try to do that in six months time- my calculation of how many months it is till September, I don't- you can help do that, but six months time--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unless you're buying research from somebody else who's already in the midst of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, is that credible way to come to a conclusion?",
      "DR. MARKS: He may be aware of a bunch of research that I'm not aware of, and that's why I'm going to be respectful here. I'd love- you know something? I just- I'd love to hear it presented. But the piece, though, that I will put to- put to you that I will not accept as a cause of autism is the MMR vaccine- or, for that matter, any of the other vaccines we use because we've studied them in so many millions of children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to- I want to come up to you specifically on this issue, because the President the United States said something artificial is causing autism rates to go up on Thursday, he said, maybe you stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot, but something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared- the HHS Secretary, appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm, and we are going to identify it.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "DR. MARKS: There's no- there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there's data that have been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are obviously data that can- that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may, but one has to be incredibly careful- incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There's a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism. But there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism. False causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. And maybe, let's say this- those of us who- many of the people at FDA are like me, we've spent six years- I spent six years after getting a college degree, getting an MD and a PhD. I spent six years after that training in internal medicine and getting- doing a fellowship in in hematology oncology so that I have three board certifications. After that, I worked in academic medicine, in industry and in government on really focusing on human health. We have a pretty good sense of science. And so the question is, I hope that people, at least when they're listening me today, find me a credible witness to say that if I'm telling you that- you know it's hard to trust people that you see on TV, but if you're hearing my voice, I hope I'm a credible witness in support of the science behind the benefit and risk- particularly for the MMR vaccine, but it's true for vaccines in general.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there may be environmental factors, environmental toxins. He said, \"We know it is an environmental toxin.\" How can you know it if the study is ongoing?",
      "DR. MARKS: I'm not going to engage again with Mr. Kennedy on this, but I'm going to tell you how science works. Science, when it's done as it- at its best, is keeping an open mind to all the possibilities. I don't know about this, with a large number of cases we have, for sure what causes- and that's because I'm not an expert in autism. And at least the people I talk to are also wondering and and trying to look at all the different possibilities of environmental, genetic, and it could be one or the other or interactions, but I don't think anybody has that knowledge that they can speak dispositively like that. People who don't know science, people who don't know how science works, people who want to control other people by pseudoscience \u2013 they talk in absolute terms. But you will- the way you detect a true scientist from a pseudo scientist is because it's very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes. There are some absolutes. If I take this mug and drop it now, I know that gravity is going to make it fall to the ground, and it's going to probably break and make a mess in the studio. On the other hand, most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You spoke about credentials, it stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "DR. MARKS: So all I can say is I would not concede- he's to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected: that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism, because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying there's a preconceived notion he's going into the study with is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I know the body of evidence that his- his father, who recently passed away, and I know what Mr. Geier has written in the past, that they have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch for the outcome of his research, but it could have impact, clearly, on vaccines, and uptake of them or faith in them.",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah. So I just I- I- I think, as someone who believes in the strength of our country, our strength is that we remain healthy as a nation. And we will be less healthy as a nation if we don't take advantage of vaccines, and our adversaries will laugh at us, because I sincerely doubt that countries like China will actually sit around and- and think that, you know, oh, we should have doubt about measles vaccine. They know that measles vaccine works, and they're going to have their populations vaccinated. I would also say to you one other thing, while I have a moment on measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "DR. MARKS: To compare our numbers of measles cases to the WHO Europe region, which includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do, is just- that's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles. We shouldn't be- I have had this problem with several individuals--and this is the closest you'll get me to a statement that may be a little bit out there--to dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me. I've watched in my life close family members, two children who have died of parents- those parents were broken. They were broken for years, and it's bringing tears to my eyes right now. No family should have to lose a child. Even- I- I feel for the families in Texas, even those that feel that they did the right thing by not giving their child the measles vaccine because God wanted it, I feel for them, because they needlessly lost a child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are more vaccines your colleagues at the FDA are still working on. I want to ask you about the Novavax COVID vaccine approval. It was delayed. Do you know of any reason why the FDA shouldn't be approving this COVID vaccine?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I really can't speak about matters that are still under- under consideration by the agency that I was involved in, but I would say that the fact that we haven't heard anything about it- because normally, by the goal date for these we're supposed to hear about them, it's concerning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Concerning to you because you think there may be a change in our government's approach to vaccine approval going forward?",
      "DR. MARKS: I guess on a larger scale, stepping back from any particular vaccine. I think just the fact that I was let go is a concern to me. I think- I hope that it wasn't because of my work on cell tissue gene therapies and on modernizing the blood donation policies that someone thought I did something wrong. I suspect--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would they think that?",
      "DR. MARKS: I don't know, I don't know, but I suspect it was because we wanted to- there was a distinct change in how the approach to vaccines would be. And I- I understand that it's a- it's a choice, potentially, that we want to focus more on chronic diseases today. But this is like, you know, why would you- why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health? It's like me telling you, you know, don't bother anymore separating where you get your drinking water from, from where you put your sewage. You would never do that, right? Because that's going back 300 years when it was figured out that you shouldn't do- do that. Why would we go back to putting our children at risk? Remember that- remember that in the- in the 18th century, in places around the globe, 10% of people- 10% of people, died of smallpox because they got it at some point in their life. There were populations where it was 5%, populations 20%. We don't know what smallpox is anymore. Why? Because of vaccines. And anyone who tries to tell you that it was public health or sanitation or the virus just got tired out, all they need to do is- is look at how robust that virus is to know that the only reason why it's not here is because of vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been massive personnel cuts to many federal agencies, particularly in the public health space. It's about 10,000, I believe more than 3,000 at the FDA itself. What does the public need to know about the impact of those cuts?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- I think what I can comment on is that the people that are left behind are going to do their best to maintain the public health, okay? They're struggling because there's a lot to be done. But they are heroes. I- you know, the people who are the heroes in public health are the everyday people who come in every day. They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might- work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can. And it's my hope that, you know, things organize appropriately.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Peter Marks, thank you for your time.",
      "DR. MARKS: Thanks so much.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more, we go to United States Trade Representative, Ambassador. Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders' level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about one and a half trillion dollars in assets in this country, about half of them are U.S. Treasuries. In the past, you've talked- you've spoken about \"strategic decoupling from China\" and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans, and the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States, and do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off Treasuries for some time. It's not a- it's not a brand-new development. You know, the Treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury Secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so- so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy, to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not- it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries, including China, with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday on this program, the Commerce Secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high tech factories to the US. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The army of millions and millions of human beings, screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones. That kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them\u2026.. Our high school educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America, to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors, and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is- it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 That's right.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, they are exempt from them?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 -- that is- that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. For now, they're subject to a 20% tariff. They're subject to a 20% tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Commerce Secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are, \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs,\" but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption. Here's what you told my colleague, Nicole Killion, April 8.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",
      "GREER: The President decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we- we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain, because we don't even import semiconductors as such that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the President said on Monday, he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he- he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What- what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you have- for the National Security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's- that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, etc--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt- that's why they're, you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Is it--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate, and that- and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of- of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I've been told you've been looking at some of these non-tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with, in current- including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage of foreign exports into the United States. ln the USMCA and in the Japan- China- the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well (INAUDIBLE)--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has- has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition- you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. I mean, it's a big ask, because we're in a- we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. It's the highest in human history. And currency certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? Do you know what happens at the end of 90 days is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I'm considering that we have 90 days before April 2. We were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was- this was not some secret everyone knew. And so, we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I- I would not say that. In the President's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this, and he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days, and I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president, I know you were testifying on- on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy. Quote, \"we wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\" He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: So that type of- that type of discussion had been happening for- for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the President could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So- so lawyer- you know, trade lawyers like- like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the President the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's forms the basis for these tariffs.",

      "NEEL KASHKARI: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like 2 billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag Leader two days ago in Minnesota who said that even if there's a 10% tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China because it's a competitive global market, it's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so in many sectors, whether it's a 10% tariff or 50% or 100% tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil. So looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, 'Hey, there are other places we also want to invest.' That it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people typically think of US Treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the President says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the US and around the world are trying to determine what is the new normal in America. You know, I saw an interview on Friday where Blackrock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10 year treasury would go to a 5% yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for where are these trade negotiations going to end up. Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5% treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100% determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see and at the Fed. Our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what, what concerned you?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near term ups and downs in the economy, but ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the central bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building in the house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If, what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "KASHKARI: Well there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one time adjustment in prices and nothing longer term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs in a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until what, May 7?",
      "KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But obviously we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy, January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But obviously this is the biggest in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy, and we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45% chance of recession. Is the risk that high in your estimate?",
      "KASHKARI: You know it's really going to be determined by are there quick resolutions? To your prior guests. Are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and hopefully those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation if everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself. Setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously the market participants are trying to grasp for where is this all going to settle, and that's causing volatility as they're, as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected, but markets are functioning, transactions are happening, and so I anticipate that's going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more. Face the Nation.",

They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",
      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday's hearing requiring the administration to disclose Garcia's \"current physical location and custodial status\" and \"what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate\" his return.",

      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his\u00a0wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.

      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",

      "\"This is bigger than just going to space,\" said Winfrey, stressing that King has \"real, real, real anxiety flying\" and jumps at even the slightest bit of turbulence. \"This is overcoming a wall of fear, a barrier. I think it's going to be cathartic in so many ways for her.\"",
      "Winfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation.",
      "\"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\"",
      "Her final words to King before the flight were: \"Peace. Be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand. He's got your back.\"",
      "History of Blue Origin's New Shepard flights",
      "Blue Origin named its New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, who piloted Mercury's Freedom 7 capsule in May 1961 on its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.",
      "The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.",
      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",
      "The unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.",
      "Blue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.",
      "\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.",
      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin\u00a0describes on its website.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "Albert Saniger, 35, the former CEO\u00a0 and founder of nate in 2018, who is from Barcelona, Spain, was indicted in the Southern District of New York for engaging in a scheme to allegedly defraud investors and making false statements about his company's AI capabilities.",
      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",
      "\"Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors,\" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "In the technology's absence, Saniger allegedly relied heavily on hundreds of workers at a call center in the Philippines, court documents said. When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",
      "The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses, the indictment said.",

In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party.

Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",

By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",

      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",

    "summary": "Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested Monday at a citizenship interview in Vermont \u2014 one day after telling CBS News he'd \"accept the outcome.\"",
    "story": [
      "Just one day before Mohsen Mahdawi was detained by immigration agents at what he was told was his citizenship interview, the Columbia student and Palestinian activist told CBS News he thought there was a chance the long-awaited appointment could be a trap.",
      "\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mahdawi \u2014 a native of the Israeli-occupied West Bank who has held a green card for the last decade \u2014 told CBS News on the eve of his detention. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"",
      "Mahdawi was taken into custody after arriving at his interview in Vermont on Monday. CBS News witnessed federal agents strapping on vests shortly after he walked into the building, emerging about an hour later with Mahdawi in handcuffs.",
      "His attorneys say he was detained under a little-used law allowing foreign nationals to be deported if they pose \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" \u2014 making him the latest student to face detention, including fellow Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's legal team has petitioned a judge to release him and alleged he is being punished for protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment and his right to due process.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's detention, federal Judge William Sessions ordered the Trump administration not to deport him or move him out of the state of Vermont while Sessions reviews the case, granting a request from Mahdawi's attorneys.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment to the State Department, which declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi \u2014 who says he was set to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in May \u2014 co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023 along with Khalil. Mahdawi was later active in protests on Columbia's campus against Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas' terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. His attorneys said in a court filing that Mahdawi \"took a step back\" from organizing the protests in March 2024, before the protests escalated later that spring, with demonstrators forming encampments and occupying a campus building.",
      "The nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests was a political lightning rod, with critics arguing the demonstrations \u2014 and their leaders \u2014 were disruptive and featured antisemitic rhetoric. Columbia is one of several schools to face a freeze in federal funding by the Trump administration, which alleges the Ivy League school \"failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\"",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News last weekend he faced \"threats\" and \"intimidation\" after speaking about the protests in a late 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview. Shortly after President Trump took office, he also drew the attention of Betar USA, a controversial pro-Israel group that tweeted in January that Mahdawi was on its \"deport list.\"",
      "The group's former Executive Director Ross Glick told CBS News that Betar USA has collected information on thousands of pro-Palestinian activists and passed it on to the Trump administration. He said it's up to the government to decide whether somebody actually supports Hamas: \"Once information is handed off, we're out of the process, right? It's ultimately up to the government, the various officials.\"",
      "Mahdawi pushed back on Betar's criticism, saying groups like Betar \"manipulate information, create lies, and attach them to the profiles of those either students or activists.\" Mahdawi has vehemently denied claims of antisemitism in the Columbia University protests more generally, calling them a \"false accusation.\"",
      "He also told CBS News over the weekend that if he's detained by federal agents, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "After Khalil was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month, Mahdawi feared he could be ensnared next. Khalil is currently held in Louisiana, and his legal future is uncertain: An immigration judge ruled last week the Trump administration can move forward with deportation but gave his lawyers until late April to file applications for relief. His lawyers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, and they are separately suing the government for his release.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he began taking precautions for his own safety, including avoiding public spaces, after Khalil's detention. Still, when he received word of a citizenship appointment, he chose to attend \u2014 though he suspected it may lead to his detention.",
      "\"It's an irony. The irony of destiny. And I accept the outcome,\" Mahdawi said a day beforehand. \"If my story will become another story for the struggle to have justice and democracy in this country, let it be.\"",

      "\"We have to give process to both sides, but we're going to move\u2026 there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding,\" U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis said at the start of a hearing in the case involving Kilmer Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador last month.",
      "Xinis ordered for the depositions to be completed by April 23. When the Justice Department suggested they might invoke privilege, Xinis told them\u00a0 \"cancel vacation, cancel other appointments\" and added that she expects \"all hands on deck.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department faced off in Xinis' courtroom Tuesday, one day after El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia.

      "Joseph Mazzarra, acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a filing shortly before the hearing that if Abrego Garcia does show up at a port of entry, he would be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and either removed to a third country or be stripped of a legal protection that he was granted in 2019, which forbid immigration authorities from removing him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "To revoke that legal status, known as withholding of removal, the Department of Homeland Security would have to re-open his immigration case and ask an immigration judge to terminate it.",

      "At Tuesday's hearing, Xinis said the Justice Department \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" while lawyers for the Justice Department asked for any orders to be stayed after the Supreme Court ruling.",

      "\"I've gotten nothing, I've gotten no real response [from the government],\" Xinis said, calling the Justice Department's arguments thus far \"two misguided ships passing in the night.\"",
      "Xinis responded to the Justice Department's suggestions that the back and forth is simply a legal dispute, and that there is \"so much daylight between what you keep saying and what the posture of the case is.\"",
      "\"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it,\" Xinis said, before she rules on holding the government in contempt of her order.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",

      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 20:16:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Bodycam footage released Tuesday from inside Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's Sante Fe home showed their German shepherd \"guarding her\" body, a sheriff's deputy said.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities on Tuesday released a lengthy investigation report detailing some of the last emails, phone calls and internet searches by Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, in the days before her death, indicating that she was scouring for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.",
      "Arakawa died in February of\u00a0hantavirus pulmonary syndrome\u00a0\u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease that can led to a range of symptoms that include flu-like illness, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, investigators have said. Hackman is believed to have died about a week later of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease.",
      "According to the report released Tuesday, a review of Arakawa's computer showed she was actively researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu-like symptoms between Feb. 8 and the morning of Feb. 12. The searches included questions about whether COVID could cause dizziness or nosebleeds.",
      "She also had mentioned in an email to her masseuse that Hackman had woken up Feb. 11 with flu or cold-like symptoms but that a COVID test was negative and she would have to reschedule her appointment for the next day \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Arakawa's search history also showed a query for a concierge medical service in Santa Fe on the morning of Feb. 12. A review of her phone records by investigators showed she had a call with the service that lasted less than 2 minutes and missed a return call later that afternoon.",
      "Earlier this month, a court cleared the way for the release of investigative records from the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa, as long as depictions of the deceased couple are blocked from view.",
      "Body camera footage released by authorities Tuesday showed officers searching the couple's Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on Feb. 26 and finding the partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, after maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. One of the redacted videos shows one of their dogs sitting in the bathroom near Arakawa's body. The German shepherd was \"guarding her,\" one of the sheriff's deputies told another in the video.",
      "As sheriff's deputies and investigators tried to piece together what had happened, they walked around the house to where they said Hackman was found dead.",
      "\"Two totally separate areas of the house,\" an officer comments.",
      "\"Mhm, it's strange,\" another responds.",
      "The officers, worried about a possible gas leak, then began opening doors and windows around the house. Subsequent testing showed there were no leaks.",
      "Another video showed investigators searching through the house for the couple's ID's.",
      "Investigators also reviewed a call history to the Hackmans' home phone along with voicemails and security footage from stores that Arakawa had visited on Feb. 11.",
      "The footage shows them going through rooms of the home and finding nothing out of the ordinary and no signs of forced entry, with the couple's art collection still adorning shelves and walls throughout. The investigators also can be seen counting cash that was found around the home and looking at the prescription medication on the bathroom counter as one of the couple's dog barked in the background.",
      "An earlier court order temporarily restricted the release of all photos, videos and documents from the investigation after a representative for the Hackman family estate urged a New Mexico judge to keep the records sealed to protect the family's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "A report by the New Mexico Department of Health showed an environmental assessment of the Hackman property found rodent feces in several outbuildings and live traps on the property. The inside of the home was clean, with no evidence of rodent activity.",
      "Nestled among the pi\u00f1on and juniper hills overlooking Santa Fe, the Hackman home is not unlike others in the area as mice are common within the surrounding landscape.",
      "While hantavirus infections are rare, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs\u00a0also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.",
      "An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during a hearing last month that the couple had taken great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.",
      "The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter, saying in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.",

    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "The CDC also released a statement, noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",

    "summary": "Under a program known as CHNV, migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration can't immediately revoke the deportation protections and work permits of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden-era program, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to terminate the legal status of those migrants on April 24. The administration had warned those affected by its announcement that they would need to self deport by that date or face arrest and deportation by federal immigration agents.",
      "But Talwani suspended the deportation warnings the government had sent and prohibited officials from revoking the legal protection, known as immigration parole, that the Biden administration granted to more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Talwani said those mass parole terminations could not happen without each case being reviewed.",
      "The \"early termination, without any case-by-case justification, of legal status for noncitizens who have complied with DHS programs and entered the country lawfully undermines the rule of law,\" wrote Talwani, who sits on the federal district court in Boston.",
      "Monday's ruling is a significant reprieve for those who arrived under a policy the Biden administration argued promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border unlawfully.",
      "Under that program, known as CHNV, a total of 532,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals. Upon entry, they were granted immigration parole and allowed to work in the U.S. lawfully for two years.",
      "Biden administration officials partially credited the policy for a sharp reduction in illegal border crossings by migrants from the four countries whose citizens were eligible to be sponsored. But the program was not implemented without controversy.",
      "Republican-led states challenged the policy's legality in federal court, arguing that the parole authority did not grant the federal government the power to admit such large numbers of foreigners through a program with broad eligibility rules.",
      "The Biden administration paused the initiative for several weeks in 2024 due to concerns about fraudulent applications. It also declined to allow those who arrived under the policy to renew their parole beyond the two-year period, saying they could seek other benefits, like asylum or temporary protected status, to remain in the U.S.",
      "The CHNV policy was paused immediately after President Trump returned to the White House in January. His administration quickly took steps to dismantle parole-based immigration policies, which it argued exceeded the president's authority. Trump administration officials have also argued those allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV initiative were not properly vetted.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would give CHNV beneficiaries 30 days to leave the U.S. voluntarily, or it would seek their arrest and removal from the country. Officials said they would prioritize the arrest of migrants who had failed to apply for another immigration benefit, like asylum or a green card.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin denounced the CHNV policy, claiming it \"unleashed over 530,000 poorly vetted aliens into America, fueling crime and stealing jobs \u2014 forcing our agents in the field to ignore rampant fraud.\"",
      "\"While this ruling delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary (Kristi) Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos, prioritizing the safety of Americans,\" McLaughlin added.",
      "The ruling is another legal setback for the Trump administration and its effort to discontinue Biden administration immigration programs that protect hundreds of thousands of migrants from deportation.",
      "Late last month, a federal judge in California prevented the administration from ending a Temporary Protected Status policy that shields more than 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. from deportation.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The list of 10 most endangered rivers of 2025, according to the nonprofit American Rivers, includes the Mississippi River and the lower Rio Grande.",
    "story": [
      "Rivers are a vital source for drinking water, plant and animal life, and community, but across the U.S., many of the largest and most critical of these waterways \u2014 and the people and wildlife they serve \u2014 are at-risk due to pollution, poor flood management and more.",
      "\"Rivers are places where people's souls heal and where they can connect with others. But that doesn't underestimate how important it also is to recognize that rivers can also be a really scary place when mismanaged,\" said Heather Taylor-Miesle, senior vice president of conservation at the nonprofit American Rivers.",
      "Growing up in Appalachia, Taylor-Miesle has seen how powerful and damaging a river can be when it unexpectedly rushes into people's homes. It's a terror many in Appalachia saw with Hurricane Helene in September and that Kentucky has seen in recent weeks.",
      "\"I don't think that you get over mucking out a basement,\" she said. \"That is baggage that you carry with you the rest of your life.\"",
      "But as destructive as rivers can be during flooding disasters, she said, \"rivers are a great equalizer\" \u2014 and that's exactly why she and American Rivers are doing everything they can to protect them. For the 40th year, the nonprofit has put out its list of \"America's Most Endangered Rivers,\" a call to action that highlights some of the biggest threats to some of the country's most critical waterways that impact millions nationwide, and emphasizes what can be done to protect them.",
      "\"Just because you're rich doesn't mean you get to hang out at a river. Just because you're poor doesn't mean you get to hang out at a river,\" Taylor-Miesle told CBS News. \"This is the place where everybody is welcomed, and I think that there's something special ... because that is something that can regulate your heartbeat, it can regulate your breathing, but it can also put you on a path to being able to keep going.\"",
      "Ten waterways made up this year's most endangered rivers list, all facing a range of threats from increased flooding and inadequate disaster prevention and response, to pollution, aging infrastructure, logging, mining, border policies and more.",
      "\"Our water wealth is one of our greatest assets as a nation,\" Tom Kiernan, president and CEO of American Rivers said in a press release. \"But pollution and extreme weather are putting our rivers, clean water, and public safety at risk. When our rivers our sick, our own health and prosperity suffers.\"",
      "Taylor-Miesle told CBS News that while the U.S. has a lot of rivers \u2014 many of which need help \u2014 there are three characteristics that qualify them to be among the most endangered: a significance to people and wildlife, a high magnitude of threat and hope.",
      "\"People call it most endangered rivers. I think these are the ones that do bring me the most hope because we have the most immediate opportunity to make a big difference,\" she said. \"Every one of these rivers are ones that you can find people, regardless of their politics, regardless of their background, thinking very strategically about how we advance the issue, how can we actually make progress.\"",
      "These are the nation's most endangered rivers in 2025, according to American Rivers' latest report.",
      "1. Mississippi River",
      "Increased flooding and inadequate disaster response put this river, which runs 2,350 miles across 10 states, at the top of this year's list.",
      "\"The Mississippi is 'America's River,' flowing through the nation's heartland, providing drinking water for 20 million people and supporting vital agriculture, industry, and recreation,\" the report says. \"But frequent and severe floods are threatening lives and businesses, while the river's health declines. Communities along the river need significant support for disaster prevention and response, as well as river restoration \u2014 but the fate of the Federal Emergency Management Agency hangs in the balance. The Trump administration should modernize FEMA to improve river health and maximize the safety, security, and prosperity of Mississippi River communities.\"",
      "2. Tijuana River",
      "The Tijuana River, which spans 120 miles across California and Baja California in Mexico, is facing the severe threat of pollution, according to American Rivers.",
      "\"This region ... has been plagued with severe pollution for decades,\" the report says. \"Every day, millions of gallons of contaminated stormwater, sewage, harmful chemicals, and trash flow down the river into the Pacific Ocean. Major federal investments are needed to solve this growing environmental and public health crises.\"",
      "3. Rivers of Southern Appalachia",
      "Southern Appalachia's rivers were thrust into the spotlight in September when Hurricane Helene devastated the region's communities, hundreds of miles from where it made landfall in Florida. That extreme weather and the flooding it unleashed are only two of the threats at play for the rivers' inclusion on the list \u2014 unsafe dams and lack of federal capacity also contributed, the group said.",
      "\"The rivers of Southern Appalachia weave a rich tapestry, vital to the region's culture and economy, and supporting an abundance of life. But Hurricane Helene devastated these rivers and communities with record flooding and landslides,\" the report says. \"Federal, state, and local partners have already allocated resources to the region, but there is a long road to recovery and preparation for the next storm in the years to come. Together we must continue to restore the rivers, invest in communities, and remove unsafe dams to strengthen the region so people and businesses can thrive despite increasingly extreme weather.\"",
      "4. Passaic River",
      "For New Jersey and New York's roughly 80-mile long Passaic River, industrial pollution remains the biggest threat, even as it remains a vital resource. The river's watershed is home to 10 reservoirs and three drinking water facilities serving more than 2 million people, American Rivers says.",
      "\"The Passaic River has always been a vital resource, supporting livelihoods and economic growth. But it has also been badly contaminated by the chemical manufacturing industry. Thanks to the work of many committed people, there is now a plan in place to clean up the contamination and begin to restore the river,\" the report says. \"We recognize the decades of effort that brought us here and urge the federal government to help see this cleanup through to completion \u2014 restoring fisheries, boosting tourism and recreation, creating jobs, and improving public health. At the same time, we urge local residents to get to know the river and help shape the restoration.\"",
      "5. Lower Rio Grande",
      "The Rio Grande is the nation's third-longest river and provides water for more than 6 million people. Its lower basin is often the only source of water, according to American Rivers. And yet the reservoirs it supplies received low investment compared to other major U.S. river systems, making water scarcity, overallocation, aging infrastructure and border policies the greatest threats to the waterway.",
      "\"The river is a vital economic, cultural, and ecological resource for people and wildlife of the United States and Mexico. But despite its immense value to people and nature, the river has been under constant threat for decades,\" the report says. \"Today, the danger is nowhere more urgent than in the Lower Rio Grande basin where water scarcity, pollution, and overallocation harm the river and communities that rely on it. The recent Minute 331 agreement established a Binational Environmental Working Group, creating a critical opportunity to advance conservation efforts and advocate for much-needed federal funding to ensure the river  can continue to support people  and nature.\"",
      "6. Rappahannock River",
      "Virginia's 195-mile-long Rappahannock River is a vital economic and agricultural resource for the state, as well as a crucial source for drinking water, according to American Rivers, but water mismanagement and a lack of planning have put the waterway in danger.",
      "\"The river is at risk from a lack of water supply planning that would safeguard and ensure the future of the region's precious water resources for all beneficial users,\" the report says. \"Increasing demand for surface water, driven by population growth, expanding industries like data centers, and declining groundwater levels, pose a significant threat to the river's health and sustainability. New state regulations require regional water supply plans, but a coordinated basin-wide approach is crucial to safeguard the Rappahannock.\"",
      "7. Clearwater River Basin",
      "Idaho's Clearwater River Basin is made up of multiple forks of the Clearwater River, as well as the Lochsa and Selway Rivers, and is part of the homelands of the Nez Perce Tribe, which American Rivers says spends nearly $3 million every year to restore local fish populations. But commercial logging, dredge mining and the construction of dams continue to threaten the basin's survival, as well as the species that inhabit it.",
      "\"The stunning Clearwater River Basin in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is known as a 'Noah's Ark' for Chinook salmon, steelhead, westslope cutthroat trout, and bull trout because its cold, clean, high-elevation streams will be able to sustain fish populations even as temperatures warm,\" the report says. \"The clean water that filters through the old growth forests and fills 700 miles of streams is one of the most valuable resources the Forest produces. A new land management plan that relaxes restrictions on mining and dam-building while expanding commercial logging could destroy habitat, trigger erosion, and pollute these exceptional streams. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest must strike a better balance to ensure that timber harvest and other activities don't degrade clean water and other values.\"",
      "8. Susitna River",
      "Alaska's Susitna River flows more than 300 miles and has a watershed nearly the size of West Virginia, providing a vital resource for salmon harvesting, hunting, recreation, tourism and more. But American Rivers has found that road construction, mining and pollution are threatening the river and the wildlife that relies on it.",
      "\"South-central Alaska's Susitna River is one of the most pristine rivers in the United States and supports the fastest growing population in the state of Alaska. Home to an abundance of fish and wildlife, the river plays an important role for Alaska Native communities and also powers a strong economy dependent on the renewable resources of fishing and hunting,\" the report says. \"But the construction of an industrial access road to allow for mining and oil and gas development threatens the area's natural wealth and all who benefit from a healthy river. We must halt federal funding and expedited permitting for this destructive road project and protect the Susitna's irreplaceable fisheries, water quality, and communities.\"",
      "9. Calcasieu River",
      "Southwest Louisiana's Calcasieu River spans roughly 200 miles, serving as a vital nursery to fish and wildlife, including Pinky, the famous pink dolphin. The river, which has played a major role throughout history, continues to be vital to the U.S. seafood industry, with nearly one-third of all the seafood consumed in the country coming from the state. But according to American Rivers, pollution has put all of this at risk.",
      "\"For centuries, the Calcasieu River has been the lifeblood of southwestern Louisiana, sustaining local communities, abundant wildlife, and thriving ecosystems,\" the report says. \"But a history of chemical mismanagement and continued unregulated dumping of toxic chemicals poses an existential threat to the river's future. The Environmental Protection Agency must update outdated federal pollution control technology standards for chemical plants, plastics manufacturers, and refineries operating along the river.\"",
      "10. Gauley River",
      "Coal mining pollution is threatening West Virginia's Gauley River, which American Rivers describes as a place with headwaters of a \"scenic splendor\" that few can rival.",
      "\"The Gauley River fuels an outdoor-recreation economy that generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually \u2014 vital revenue in a region reeling from generations of boom-and-bust extractive industries,\" the report says. \"The Gauley is a world-famous whitewater destination, beloved by kayakers and rafters from around the globe. Yet, this same remarkable watershed faces a grave threat: toxic pollution from coal strip mining in the headwaters of the Cherry River, one of the Gauley's primary tributaries.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man involved in protests at Columbia University, was taken into custody by federal agents Monday when he arrived at a citizenship interview in Vermont, his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "Mahdawi's detention comes as the Trump administration fights to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
      "Mahdawi's legal team told CBS News federal agents informed them the Trump administration detained Mahdawi under an obscure law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State decides someone poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The administration cited the same provision to detain Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers filed a petition in court asking for his release, claiming his detention violated the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\" his attorney, Luna Droubi, alleged in a statement. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News' request for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Mahdawi's attorney Luna Droubi said in a statement Mahdawi's legal team has \"not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him.\" Federal Judge William Sessions temporarily barred the government from removing Mahdawi from Vermont on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi was born in a West Bank refugee camp and has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade, according to his lawyers. He completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year, and was expected to graduate in May before seeking a master's degree from the university this fall.",
      "Khalil and Mahdawi co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023, Mahdawi's lawyers said in court documents. Khalil later spoke at campus protests over Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, which began after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Mahdawi has drawn attention in the past. Betar USA \u2014 a controversial pro-Israel group that regularly encourages the Trump administration to detain pro-Palestinian protest leaders \u2014 tweeted a video of Mahdawi in January and said he's on the organization's \"deport list.\"",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told CBS News in a statement the group has \"provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump Administration of visitors to America who support Hamas and will continue to.\"",
      "Mahdawi's lawyers say he has backed a \"peaceful political solution\" to the Palestinian conflict. In a 2023 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Mahdawi told Bill Whitaker about a campus rally during which an unidentified person yelled an antisemitic statement. Mahdawi said he was \"shocked\" and told the person, \"you don't represent us.\"",
      "Mahdawi is the latest student to face immigration detention. Khalil, who also holds a green card, was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month. The government is seeking his removal from the country, accusing him of supporting Hamas and participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" When asked to provide evidence for Khalil's detention, the government cited a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that said that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives but did not provide any evidence of Khalil declaring support for Hamas.",
      "Tufts University\u00a0student\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk was detained weeks later, with her attorneys claiming she was targeted for co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper.",
      "Khalil and Ozturk are both detained in Louisiana. A federal immigration judge ruled last week the government can move forward with its push to deport Khalil, but he has until later this month to seek relief from deportation. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal, and he's separately suing over his detention. Ozturk is also suing for her release, and her attorneys faced off against the Trump administration in a hearing Monday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the practice of revoking visas, writing on X after Khalil's arrest, \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

    "summary": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said \"of course I'm not going to do it\" about returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to an El Salvadoran prison.",
    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives in\u00a0Maryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. An\u00a0analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"",
      "\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"",
      "Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,\u00a0Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government.

      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 An Israeli airstrike hit the northern gate of a field hospital in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, killing a medic and wounding 10 other people, the hospital's director said. The strike that hit the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in the Muwasi area was the second on a Gaza health facility in three days, coming after the last major hospital still providing critical care in the Palestinian enclave was hit Sunday in an attack the United Nations said had left it \"out of service.\"",
      "Israel's attacks in Gaza have continued for almost a month, since the country abandoned a ceasefire with Hamas that had been negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. Efforts to strike a new ceasefire agreement have made little apparent headway since then, though Hamas has said it is considering a new proposal from Israel this week.",
      "Multiple news agencies cited Hamas officials as saying Israel had offered a 45-day halt in the fighting in exchange for the release of hostages. But Hamas officials cited by multiple news agencies reiterated that their would be no ceasefire agreement without a commitment by Israel to end the war and withdraw forces from Gaza. Hamas officials were also quoted as saying Israel had included a demand for the group to agree to disarm \u2014 something one representative was quoted as saying \"is not up for discussions.\"",
      "Israel's government had not confirmed the new offer to Hamas as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter in sprawling tent camps around the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, but the wounded from Tuesday's strike were all patients and medics, including two patients who were left in critical condition, according to hospital spokesman Saber Mohammed.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces on the Tuesday strike. The IDF has bombed hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel, of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hamas and Gazan hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians and deliberately gutting the territory's health system.",
      "On Sunday, Israel struck the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City after ordering an evacuation. The United Nations said a child patient with a reported head injury died while being evacuated, and the strike severely damaged the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings.",
      "Al Ahli Hospital \"is out of service,\" Director-General of the U.N.'s World Health Program Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet, adding: \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman echoed that sentiment, saying: \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, also condemned the strike.",
      "Israel said it targeted a Hamas command and control center within the facility, without providing evidence. Hamas denied the allegations.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 people, according to an updated toll released by the Gaza Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That includes more than 1,600 people killed since Israel ended the ceasefire and resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to Gaza's Hamas-run government. Its casualty count is seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. The offensive has destroyed much of the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza. Israeli officials say 59 of those hostages remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press.",
      "The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed in 2021 in a move widely seen as politically motivated.",

    "story": [
      "Two men with metal detectors recently discovered a trove of ancient treasure in Transylvania, which shed new light on early settlements in the storied historical region, local officials said. Encompassing much of present-day Romania, Transylvania is known for its medieval towns, Gothic architecture and vampiric folklore, with a mythical reputation tied to the fictional character Dracula and his real-life inspiration, the notorious 15th-century ruler Vlad the Impaler.",
      "The treasure unearthed this spring in the Transylvanian town of Breaza dates back much farther than the brutal monarch's reign. In an announcement shared last week, officials in Breaza said the metal detectorists found jewelry that originally belonged to Dacian people, who inhabited what is now Transylvania and some of its surrounding areas from around the 1st century B.C.E. until the 1st century of the common era. Dacia was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire.",
      "Silver brooches and a bracelet decorated with plant motifs were among the artifacts discovered, in addition to a chain necklace and a belt constructed out of circular metallic pendants, each marked with solar symbols. The treasure weighed 550 grams altogether, officials said, equating to more a pound.",
      "The Mures County Museum, near Breaza, confirmed the jewelry's origins in ancient Dacian society. An archaeologist at the museum, Daniel Ciota, will study the treasure as it is prepared for display.",
      "Officials in Breaza said the silver pieces were likely worn by a Dacian aristocrat, citing its lavishness as a signal of its owner's status, potentially as a \"high-ranking\" member of their society. As for why the jewels were ultimately buried in the ground, the officials suggested they could have been used as offerings to some unknown deity long ago. However, they also acknowledged someone may have hidden them for more personal reasons.",
      "There were no previous records of Dacian settlements in this part of Transylvania, and the treasure is the first physical evidence off Dacian people living around Breaza. Moving forward, officials said archaeologists and researchers will begin to explore the area in hopes of finding remnants of a settlement where the owner of the jewels may have lived.",
      "\"These historical artifacts remind us of the cultural heritage and importance of our region in the history of Dacia,\" the town of Breaza wrote in a social media post unveiling the treasure. \"This discovery honors and encourages us to proudly protect and promote our heritage.\"",

      "A Dutch court last year handed down lengthy jail sentences to three of the main suspects in the murder, sentencing the organizer of the hit to 30 years, while two other men received 28 years. Three other men received sentences of between 10 to 14 years for complicity in the murder.",
      "The latest suspect, born in Curacao but who had Dutch nationality, has been behind bars on the island since 2014.",
      "\"Detectives continued their investigation into those who ordered the hit on De Vries,\" the prosecution service said.",

    "story": [
      "Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations\u00a0next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Iranian state TV also said U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi \"briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister\" at the end of the talks, marking a direct interaction between the two nations locked in decades of tensions.",
      "The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location on the outskirts of Oman, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local.",
      "The White House said Witkoff was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima for the talks, which it described to be \"very positive and constructive.\"",
      "\"Special Envoy Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations' differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,\" the White House said Saturday in a statement. \"These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening that the talks with Iran are \"going okay\" but declined to give further details.",
      "\"Nothing matters until you get it done,\" he said.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman",
      "AP journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the \"indirect talks\" had begun.",
      "\"These talks will be held at a location planned by the Omani host, with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States seated in the halls and sides, conveying their points of view and positions to each other through the Omani Foreign Minister,\" Baghaei wrote.",
      "About an hour later, Baghaei appeared on Iranian state television and acknowledged the talks had been going on all that time.",
      "\"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear \u2014 we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran's national interests,\" he said. \"We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions.\"",
      "Baghaei added: \"Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator. Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.\"",
      "Araghchi earlier spoke to Iranian journalists.",
      "\"If there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\" Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \"What is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\"",
      "Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being \"direct.\"",
      "\"I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \"That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\"",
      "He added: \"Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\"",
      "Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \"you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\" \u2014 unworkable.",

      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts.

The console is set to redefine gaming experiences worldwide, and Fox was there to capture the excitement.",
      "The Switch 2 is priced at $450 for the console alone, with an option to purchase a bundled package at $500, which includes the new racer \"pack-in\" game, Mario Kart World.",
      "Nintendo has listened to feedback from the initial Switch release and introduced significant upgrades to the Switch 2's hardware. The Joy-Con controllers now connect via magnets, eliminating the traditional track system. Enhanced with a gyroscope and a new mouse mechanic, players can simulate movement with precision, akin to rolling a ball across the floor. The system's fidelity has been increased, offering 1080p in handheld mode and 4K in docked mode, along with improved frames per second for smoother animations and quicker on-screen reactions for competitive gamers.",
      "The new console boasts an integrated chat feature, eliminating the clunky external phone connections of its predecessor. Equipped with a noise-canceling microphone and high-grade speakers, communication is seamless and clear. Additionally, the new webcam can separate four individuals for party games, creating a dynamic streaming experience where players can share screens, assist each other, or simply enjoy different games together.",
      "Nintendo is also offering free local sharing of digital games among Switch 2 consoles, allowing multiplayer experiences without requiring each player to own the game. While currently limited, this feature could become a staple in the broader gaming world. The console is also backward compatible with most Switch 1 games, ensuring that previous investments are not lost. Select games, like the recently released Switch 1 Mario Party Jamboree, will receive upgrades for a fee, including the expansion Jamboree TV.",
      "Mario Kart World was the first game showcased, promising bigger races, innovative modes, and exciting new power-ups. With 24 drivers per race, the largest in the series, players can now enjoy an open-world mode to explore courses with friends. The new knockout mode adds a competitive edge, requiring racers to place within a range to advance through multiple race legs.",
      "One interesting game that had us scratching our heads was Drive X Drag. Upon announcement, reactions were mixed. The game is essentially 3-on-3 wheelchair basketball, offering a challenging experience that, while not entirely reflective of actual wheelchair basketball, provides a unique gameplay twist.",
      "A new interesting way to combat scalpers has also been added to Nintendo\u2019s toolbox,\u00a0 utilizing a subscription on the Nintendo Switch Online system, and playtime of at least 50 hours are the only way you can preorder from Nintendo.\u00a0\u00a0 Originally slated to start preorders for April 9th, Nintendo blames President Trump\u2019s tariffs for a delay in that original timeline.",

      "1)\u00a0Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with the latest patches, no system is entirely immune to threats. Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won\u2019t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how robots can milk, feed and clean cows on dairy farms, boosting efficiency and comfort.",
      "Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there\u2019s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works.",
      "These robots aren\u2019t just doing the heavy lifting; they\u2019re creating a stress-free, comfortable environment for the cows while keeping things efficient and sustainable.",

      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

      "From milking to manure: How robots lighten the load for dairy farmers",
      "Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

      "CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING",
      "Dairy industry 4.0",
      "The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity.",

      "Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",
      "Lely recognizes the importance of designing robots that are not only functional but also trustworthy and reliable. Jan Jacobs emphasizes that the robots are not intended to be friends with the cows or the farmers but rather professional employees.",

      "Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for.",
      "Lely helps farmers prepare for the shift to robotic dairy farming, both in terms of the physical environment and their mindset. This includes managing the massive amount of data generated by the robots and using it for long-term optimization.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today\u2019s internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time.",
      "This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are.

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before.

      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",

      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",

      "A life turned upside down",
      "At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",
      "\"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition.",
      "Her adolescence was marked by sleepless nights and constant medical challenges, robbing her of the simple joys of being a teenager. For years, there seemed to be no solution in sight.",

      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "A revolutionary solution",
      "Everything changed this past summer when Clara became the first pediatric patient to undergo a minimally invasive procedure at the Mayo Clinic using NeuroOne's cutting-edge brain implant technology. The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "Imagine receiving a notification about suspicious charges on a credit card you haven\u2019t even received yet. How could that happen?",
      "While it sounds surprising and unsettling, it's increasingly common due to the rise of digital credit card fraud. Criminals no longer need physical cards to make unauthorized transactions, thanks to methods such as data breaches, phishing schemes and card-not-present fraud.",
      "Here's how these schemes work and what steps you should take immediately to protect yourself.",

      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",

    "summary": "An Israeli official says military operations and hostage talks are fully coordinated with the U.S., as officials remain optimistic about a deal. Israel continues its advance in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions.",
      "Nearly a month into Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels\u2014militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.",

      "Activity of troops of the 36th Division in the Rafah area on April 5th, 2025.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, \"Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",
      "Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel\u2019s legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.\"",

    "summary": "From sharing IRS data with ICE, calling for registries and revoking the legal mechanisms thousands have used to come to the U.S., Trump's directives send a clear message.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is waging a concerted pressure campaign against undocumented immigrants \u2014 as well as hundreds of thousands here legally\u00a0whose status it is trying to revoke. The measures threaten to make daily life more untenable for millions as President Donald Trump aims to carry out the immigrant purging he promised during his campaign.",
      "Trump has escalated his clampdown on immigrants beyond what was done during his first presidential term, which included separating children from their parents at the border, working to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico and curbing legal immigration through fewer visas and refugee admissions.",
      "This time around, on top of immigration raids and arrests, the administration is inflicting hardship on immigrants by pulling multiple levers of government to undercut their day-to-day lives.",
      "The administration is threatening criminal charges against immigrants without legal status who do not register with the government. It has given Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to previously confidential taxpayer information to locate immigrants and canceled Social Security numbers of thousands of immigrants by marking \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d as being dead. Officials have canceled parole that the Biden administration granted to some groups. A federal judge has blocked the revocations temporarily.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing now is this full-court press by the government on immigration,\u201d said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit immigrant rights advocacy organization whose funding to provide legal help to unaccompanied immigrant children Trump cut.",
      "The many actions are all parts of the administration\u2019s strategy to subtract as many immigrants from the United States as possible without having to go through more cumbersome deportation processes. The Trump actions build on an \u201cattrition through enforcement\u201d strategy tried in 2010 with state anti-immigration laws, a strategy pushed by Kris Kobach, a former attorney general of Kansas who has championed conservative causes.",
      "Data obtained by NBC News shows that the Trump administration\u2019s deportations are running slightly behind deportations under President Joe Biden at the same time last year, even though Trump has made mass deportations one of his main priorities since he assumed office.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made it clear recently what level of departures the administration wants to see. At a recent Cabinet meeting, she said, \u201cWe got 20, 21 million people that need to go home.\" Republicans and conservatives have long used about 20 million as the number of undocumented people in the country, though longtime analyses have pegged the number at closer to 11 million to 12 million.",
      "As is evident in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 a Maryland man who a Justice Department official said was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador \u2014 the administration is willing to push the edge of the legal envelope to meet its mass deportation goal.\u00a0At a contentious hearing Tuesday, a U.S. district judge ordered the administration to provide evidence of any steps it has taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"Over 77 million people delivered a resounding Election Day mandate in November to secure our borders, mass deport criminal illegal migrants, and enforce our\u00a0immigration\u00a0laws,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told NBC News in a statement. \"The Trump administration is aligned on a whole-of-government approach to deliver on this mandate to once again put Americans and America First.\u201d",
      "He did not respond to questions about criticism of the administration's actions or about any spillover effects on U.S. citizens.",
      "'Taking people's legal status away'",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday that Trump would sign an order preventing undocumented immigrants from getting Social Security benefits.",
      "But undocumented immigrants, and many people legally working, are already prohibited from receiving Social Security payouts or Medicare, said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, a distinguished immigration fellow and visiting scholar at Cornell Law School.",
      "She said Trump's latest order is \"continued fearmongering and disinformation because, in fact, undocumented immigrants pay into Social Security but are never eligible to get those benefits.\"",
      "\"On the one hand, the rhetoric of Trump has been about focusing on the undocumented immigrants and the worst 'criminals,' etc., but what we've actually seen from a policymaking perspective is they are actually taking people's legal status away,\" Hincapi\u00e9 said.",
      "There are immigrants in the United States with different forms of legal status, such as Temporary Protected Status or work authorization that was granted while they were awaiting asylum claim outcomes, which makes them eligible to apply for Social Security numbers. But getting Social Security numbers does not mean they are eligible for benefits, Hincapi\u00e9 said.",
      "\"There are separate laws dating all the way to the 1996 welfare reform law that indicate who is eligible for what program, and for most people, you have to have been a legal permanent resident \u2014 a green card holder \u2014 for at least five years to be a qualified legal immigrant that is eligible for certain benefits,\" she said.",
      "The administration has threatened penalties against undocumented immigrants 14 and older who fail to register with the government and carry proof they registered with them.",
      "To register, they must fill out a form that asks them not only about any crimes they may have been arrested for or charged with, but also any they committed but for which they were not prosecuted, said Bill Hing, founder of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "The law to register has existed for decades but had not previously been enforced.",
      "Hing questioned how Trump would enforce the required registration, because, he said, trying to get someone indicted for not carrying registration papers would complicate and lengthen a deportation process. He acknowledged that the administration might try to make an example of a case or two. But the requirement \"is a mechanism to induce people, to coerce people, into exposing themselves,\" he said.",
      "In addition, Hing said, if he were representing people arrested for failing to register, he would argue they have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, since they are asked to admit to crimes when they fill out the forms.",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I've jaywalked. I've sped,\" he said. \"I think someone being prosecuted has a very good Fifth Amendment argument not to register.\"",
      "While the immigration crackdown actions are aimed at immigrants, they are affecting citizens, too.",
      "In early April, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner posted on social media that he had directed HUD offices to ensure HUD programs do not benefit undocumented immigrants. People here illegally cannot get federal subsidized housing. But an estimated 25,000 families in public housing include at least one U.S. citizen and at least one person without legal immigration status, according to the National Housing Law Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization. The citizen would be eligible for the housing.",
      "Marie Claire Tran-Leung, an attorney for the National Housing Law Project, said Trump and Turner are trying to deploy HUD \"to scare immigrant families into self-evicting.\"",
      "Whether the administration's measures will force out enough immigrants to satisfy Trump and his base is unknown.",
      "But Hincapi\u00e9 said that with the administration moving \u201cso rapidly\u201d and in a \u201cchaotic way,\u201d some U.S. citizens may get caught in the immigration dragnet. For instance, some could end up wrongly classified as dead and their Social Security numbers put in the agency's death file, she said.",
      "\"Are they going to do the same thing they are doing with Kilmar [Abrego Garcia] of saying, 'Oops, sorry, we made a mistake and we can't do anything about it now'?\""

      "The White House has shown no signs of pushing for Abrego Garcia's return, and Trump has repeatedly touted his push to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they have been transferred to a notorious prison.

      "The finding, based on an analysis of medical records from 2022, reflects a dramatic rise in autism over the past two decades. Previous CDC reports showed that 1 in 54 8-year-olds had been diagnosed with autism in 2016. In 2000, it was 1 in 150.",
      "\u201cThe most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common presentations of autism are,\u201d said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report.",
      "Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center\u2019s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder.",

      "\u201cWe have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe may have hundreds, if not thousands, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal cybersecurity specialist has alleged in a whistleblower statement made public Tuesday that President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) caused a security breach at the National Labor Relations Board and may have illegally removed sensitive data from the board.",
      "The specialist, Daniel Berulis, made the allegations in a sworn declaration submitted to members of Congress and to a federal whistleblower office, asking them to investigate what he called a cybersecurity breach. His lawyer said that Berulis had also been targeted with a threatening note and photographs showing him near where he lives. The declaration was first reported by NPR, and NBC News has not independently verified the allegations.",
      "The whistleblower report, which NBC News has reviewed a copy of, comes as DOGE and Trump\u2019s billionaire adviser Elon Musk continue to face multiple lawsuits questioning their access to computer systems across the federal government.",
      "Berulis, who works at the labor board, wrote in the declaration that within days of DOGE staffers arriving in March, he noticed a series of \u201canomalous\u201d events in the board\u2019s computer systems. Those included changes to the use of multi-factor authentication, which is a widely used security protocol, and internal alerting systems being switched off, he wrote in the 14-page statement.",
      "He also wrote that he tracked what appeared to be the outbound transfer of around 10 gigabytes or more of data \u2014 \u201cthe equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias\u201d if the data were all text files, he wrote. He wrote that the removal was \u201cextremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB\u2019s databases.\u201d",
      "The database accessed by DOGE contained personally identifiable information of \u201cclaimants and respondents with pending matters before the agency\u201d as well as confidential business information gathered during investigations, he wrote.",
      "He added that after DOGE gained access to the labor board\u2019s systems, there was an increase in attempted logins from locations outside the United States including from a user with an internet protocol (IP) address in Russia. He wrote that the person with the Russian IP address appeared to have a correct username and password, created minutes earlier by DOGE engineers, and was blocked from logging in only because of their location.",
      "\u201cThose attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming,\u201d Berulis wrote.",
      "Berulis included in his disclosure several screenshots from a computer workstation that he says are evidence of data being transferred. He wrote that he has almost two decades of experience in his field and that he has held a Top Secret security clearance.",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that DOGE had been transparent about its work at the NLRB.",
      "\u201cIt is months-old news that President Trump signed an Executive Order to hire DOGE employees at agencies and coordinate data sharing,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir highly-qualified team has been extremely public and transparent in its efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse across the Executive Branch, including the NLRB,\u201d she added. Her statement did not address the alleged transfer of data.",
      "The NLRB and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a comment to NPR, an NLRB spokesperson denied that the agency had granted DOGE access to its systems, said DOGE had not requested access to the agency\u2019s systems and said that an internal investigation conducted after Berulis raised his concerns \u201cdetermined that no breach of agency systems occurred.\u201d",
      "In litigation about DOGE\u2019s access to federal data, although not specifically at the NLRB, the Justice Department has argued that DOGE enjoys sweeping authority to access data under an executive order that Trump signed on the first day of his second term. That executive order directs all agency heads to \u201ctake all necessary steps\u201d to ensure that DOGE \u201chas full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems\u201d to the \u201cextent consistent with law.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear if Berulis\u2019 disclosure would lead to an investigation. Two lawmakers to whom Berulis addressed his disclosure did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Andrew Bakaj, a lawyer representing Berulis in his capacity as a whistleblower, wrote in a letter to members of Congress that he believed the conduct at issue violated the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, a 2014 law designed to safeguard government data, as well as the federal Privacy Act.",
      "\u201cAs you are certainly aware, the practical, legal, and national security implications of such an intrusion are vast,\u201d Bakaj wrote.",
      "The lawyer also wrote that on April 7, while Berulis was preparing his written statement, someone physically taped a threatening note to his home door along with photographs taken via a drone of him walking in his neighborhood.",
      "\u201cThe threatening note made clear reference to this very disclosure he was preparing for you, as the proper oversight authority. While we do not know specifically who did this, we can only speculate that it involved someone with the ability to access NLRB systems,\u201d Bakaj wrote."

      "The district said the gun did not enter the school building during the primary intake period when students pass through metal detectors.",
      "District officials would not say how the gun made its way into the building or what happened in the moments before shots were fired.",

      "District leaders said classes would be canceled at the school through the rest of the week and counselors would be made available to anyone struggling after the shooting."

      "If Xinis or another federal judge decides that President Donald Trump and federal officials have failed to comply with their orders, what action can they take to enforce them?",
      "One way is a process known as civil contempt.\u00a0That involves a judge issuing an order holding either the government writ large or an officer of the government in contempt.\u00a0The judge could impose daily fines or even order someone jailed until the contempt is \u201cpurged,\u201d which would happen when the offending party does what the judge wants.",
      "Criminal contempt requires charges by the Justice Department, which the president oversees, so it is a less viable option. A president can also revoke criminal contempt by issuing a pardon. Civil contempt, though, is not pardonable.",
      "Judges are generally reluctant to hold U.S. government litigants in contempt, but they have done so.\u00a0During the Obama administration, a judge\u00a0held the Interior Department in contempt for imposing a moratorium in 2011 on offshore oil drilling after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.",

      "Is jail an option?",
      "What if a judge decided that jailing an officer of the government would be the only way to enforce a court order?",
      "The option is complicated by the fact that federal contempt\u00a0orders\u00a0are enforced by U.S. marshals. The marshals are part of the executive branch, not the judicial branch, but their mission is to both \"enforce federal laws and provide support to virtually all elements of the federal justice system.\"",
      "The president, who oversees the marshals, could order them not to enforce a contempt order against an executive branch official \u2014 although that would violate the law.",
      "\u201cFor the president to call off the marshals would flagrantly violate the statute charging the marshals to carry out court\u00a0orders, as well as a norm unbroken since the 1800s that presidents do not defy federal court\u00a0orders,\u201d wrote Nicholas Parillo, a professor at Yale Law School who reviewed data on thousands of court filings in\u00a0an extensive 2018 article\u00a0on contempt.",
      "David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School,\u00a0noted in a recent Democracy Docket article that federal rules appear to allow judges, if needed, to bypass the marshals and hire other parties to enforce their contempt rulings.",
      "The federal rules of civil procedure, Noll added,\u00a0specify how certain types of \u201cprocess\u201d \u2014 the legal term for\u00a0orders\u00a0that command someone to appear in court \u2014 are to be served. The rule states that, as a general matter, process \u201cmust be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal\u00a0or by a person specially appointed for that purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo be sure, a court that appointed someone other than the marshals to enforce a civil contempt order would be breaking new ground,\u201d Noll wrote.",
      "\u201cBecause of the marshals\u2019 long and honorable history of respecting their\u00a0legal obligation\u00a0to enforce federal courts\u00a0orders, the courts have rarely, if ever, had to turn to other parties to have their\u00a0orders\u00a0enforced,\" he said.",
      "Local police and sheriffs could do the job, he added, and \"unlike the marshals, these individuals would be responsible to the court alone.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court factor",
      "Another question is what appeals courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, would do with a contempt ruling against the Trump administration.",
      "Parillo\u2019s research found that while district court judges are willing to issue contempt findings, sanctions are rarely upheld on appeal.",
      "\u201cThere are no opinions of the Supreme Court on the subject,\" he wrote. \"When the courts of appeals hear a potentially relevant case, they usually dispose of it on narrow, case-specific grounds in a deliberate attempt to avoid the bigger and more portentous issues about whether and when judges can use contempt sanctions against the federal government.\"",
      "In a 1911 ruling, in Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove & Range Co.,\u00a0the Supreme Court described the need\u00a0for courts to be able to enforce their\u00a0orders\u00a0through contempt but do so sparingly.",
      "\u201cThe power of courts to punish for contempts is a necessary and integral part of the independence of the judiciary, and is absolutely essential to the performance of the duties imposed on them by law,\u201d the opinion says. \u201cWithout it, they are mere boards of arbitration, whose judgments and decrees would only be advisory.\"",

      "The inspectors found live rodents, dead rodents and rodent feces in a detached garage and rodent feces in the property's two guest houses and in its detached storage facilities, according to the state report on the inspection.",
      "They also found a rodent nest, a live rodent and a dead rodent among working vehicles, abandoned vehicles or farm machinery on the property, the report said.",

      "She also wrote: \"Main dwelling clean with no signs of rodent activity.\"",
      "VinHatton estimated the size of the main house is 8,000 to 9,000 square feet. A Redfin listing for the address says the four-bedroom home is 8,761 square feet in size and stands on a 6-acre parcel.",

      "Nearby, another dog was found dead in a dog crate.",
      "In a necropsy report made public as part of Tuesday's release of documents and video, veterinary pathologist John Ragsdale concluded that if the dog was confined amid the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa \u2014 whose bodies were discovered Feb. 26, roughly eight days Hackman died \u2014 it may have died from lack of food and water.",

But a new show debuted in 1975 on NBC called \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d By December 1976, \u201cGambit\u201d was off the air and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d became an institution that is still going strong today.",
      "Martindale bounced back in 1978 with \u201cTic-Tac-Dough,\u201d the classic X\u2019s and O\u2019s game on CBS that ran until 1985.",
      "\u201cOvernight I had gone from the outhouse to the penthouse,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He presided over the 88-game winning streak of Navy Lt. Thom McKee, who earned over $300,000 in cash and prizes that included eight cars, three sailboats and 16 vacation trips. At the time, McKee\u2019s winnings were a record for a game show contestant.",
      "\u201cI love working with contestants, interacting with the audience and to a degree, watching lives change,\u201d Martindale wrote. \u201cWinning a lot of cash can cause that to happen.\u201d",
      "Martindale wrote that producer Dan Enright once told him that in the seven years he hosted \u201cTic-Tac-Dough\u201d he gave away over $7 million in cash and prizes.",
      "Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.",
      "Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was \u201cIs Wink your real name?\u201d The second was \u201cHow did you get into game shows?\u201d",
      "He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.",
      "Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.",
      "He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.",
      "After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson\u2019s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.",
      "Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record \u201cThat\u2019s All Right\u201d was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.",
      "Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale\u2019s TV show \u201cTop Ten Dance Party\u201d in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.",
      "Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale\u2019s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of \u201cG.I. Blues\u201d in 1960.",
      "In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of \u201cDeck of Cards,\u201d which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could easily have thought, \u2019Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.\u201d",
      "A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry.",
      "His first network hosting job was on NBC\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s This Song?\u201d where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65.",
      "He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: \u201cDream Girl \u201967\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019s Your Mother-in-Law?\u201d The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!\u201d Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.",
      "Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of \u201cGambit\u201d from 1980-81.",
      "He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was \u201cHeadline Chasers,\u201d a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, \u201cBumper Stumpers,\u201d ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990.",
      "He hosted \u201cDebt\u201d from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and \u201cInstant Recall\u201d on GSN in 2010.",
      "Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated \u201cThe 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.\u201d In 2021, he hosted syndicated program \u201cThe History of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll.\u201d",
      "In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe.",
      "He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale\u2019s children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972."

    "summary": "From sharing IRS data with ICE, calling for registries and revoking the legal mechanisms thousands have used to come to the U.S., Trump's directives send a clear message.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is waging a concerted pressure campaign against undocumented immigrants \u2014 as well as hundreds of thousands here legally\u00a0whose status it is trying to revoke. The measures threaten to make daily life more untenable for millions as President Donald Trump aims to carry out the immigrant purging he promised during his campaign.",
      "Trump has escalated his clampdown on immigrants beyond what was done during his first presidential term, which included separating children from their parents at the border, working to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico and curbing legal immigration through fewer visas and refugee admissions.",
      "This time around, on top of immigration raids and arrests, the administration is inflicting hardship on immigrants by pulling multiple levers of government to undercut their day-to-day lives.",
      "The administration is threatening criminal charges against immigrants without legal status who do not register with the government. It has given Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to previously confidential taxpayer information to locate immigrants and canceled Social Security numbers of thousands of immigrants by marking \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d as being dead. Officials have canceled parole that the Biden administration granted to some groups. A federal judge has blocked the revocations temporarily.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing now is this full-court press by the government on immigration,\u201d said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit immigrant rights advocacy organization whose funding to provide legal help to unaccompanied immigrant children Trump cut.",
      "The many actions are all parts of the administration\u2019s strategy to subtract as many immigrants from the United States as possible without having to go through more cumbersome deportation processes. The Trump actions build on an \u201cattrition through enforcement\u201d strategy tried in 2010 with state anti-immigration laws, a strategy pushed by Kris Kobach, a former attorney general of Kansas who has championed conservative causes.",
      "Data obtained by NBC News shows that the Trump administration\u2019s deportations are running slightly behind deportations under President Joe Biden at the same time last year, even though Trump has made mass deportations one of his main priorities since he assumed office.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made it clear recently what level of departures the administration wants to see. At a recent Cabinet meeting, she said, \u201cWe got 20, 21 million people that need to go home.\" Republicans and conservatives have long used about 20 million as the number of undocumented people in the country, though longtime analyses have pegged the number at closer to 11 million to 12 million.",
      "As is evident in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 a Maryland man who a Justice Department official said was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador \u2014 the administration is willing to push the edge of the legal envelope to meet its mass deportation goal.\u00a0At a contentious hearing Tuesday, a U.S. district judge ordered the administration to provide evidence of any steps it has taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"Over 77 million people delivered a resounding Election Day mandate in November to secure our borders, mass deport criminal illegal migrants, and enforce our\u00a0immigration\u00a0laws,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told NBC News in a statement. \"The Trump administration is aligned on a whole-of-government approach to deliver on this mandate to once again put Americans and America First.\u201d",
      "He did not respond to questions about criticism of the administration's actions or about any spillover effects on U.S. citizens.",
      "'Taking people's legal status away'",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday that Trump would sign an order preventing undocumented immigrants from getting Social Security benefits.",
      "But undocumented immigrants, and many people legally working, are already prohibited from receiving Social Security payouts or Medicare, said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, a distinguished immigration fellow and visiting scholar at Cornell Law School.",
      "She said Trump's latest order is \"continued fearmongering and disinformation because, in fact, undocumented immigrants pay into Social Security but are never eligible to get those benefits.\"",
      "\"On the one hand, the rhetoric of Trump has been about focusing on the undocumented immigrants and the worst 'criminals,' etc., but what we've actually seen from a policymaking perspective is they are actually taking people's legal status away,\" Hincapi\u00e9 said.",
      "There are immigrants in the United States with different forms of legal status, such as Temporary Protected Status or work authorization that was granted while they were awaiting asylum claim outcomes, which makes them eligible to apply for Social Security numbers. But getting Social Security numbers does not mean they are eligible for benefits, Hincapi\u00e9 said.",
      "\"There are separate laws dating all the way to the 1996 welfare reform law that indicate who is eligible for what program, and for most people, you have to have been a legal permanent resident \u2014 a green card holder \u2014 for at least five years to be a qualified legal immigrant that is eligible for certain benefits,\" she said.",
      "The administration has threatened penalties against undocumented immigrants 14 and older who fail to register with the government and carry proof they registered with them.",
      "To register, they must fill out a form that asks them not only about any crimes they may have been arrested for or charged with, but also any they committed but for which they were not prosecuted, said Bill Hing, founder of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "The law to register has existed for decades but had not previously been enforced.",
      "Hing questioned how Trump would enforce the required registration, because, he said, trying to get someone indicted for not carrying registration papers would complicate and lengthen a deportation process. He acknowledged that the administration might try to make an example of a case or two. But the requirement \"is a mechanism to induce people, to coerce people, into exposing themselves,\" he said.",
      "In addition, Hing said, if he were representing people arrested for failing to register, he would argue they have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, since they are asked to admit to crimes when they fill out the forms.",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I've jaywalked. I've sped,\" he said. \"I think someone being prosecuted has a very good Fifth Amendment argument not to register.\"",
      "While the immigration crackdown actions are aimed at immigrants, they are affecting citizens, too.",
      "In early April, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner posted on social media that he had directed HUD offices to ensure HUD programs do not benefit undocumented immigrants. People here illegally cannot get federal subsidized housing. But an estimated 25,000 families in public housing include at least one U.S. citizen and at least one person without legal immigration status, according to the National Housing Law Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization. The citizen would be eligible for the housing.",
      "Marie Claire Tran-Leung, an attorney for the National Housing Law Project, said Trump and Turner are trying to deploy HUD \"to scare immigrant families into self-evicting.\"",
      "Whether the administration's measures will force out enough immigrants to satisfy Trump and his base is unknown.",
      "But Hincapi\u00e9 said that with the administration moving \u201cso rapidly\u201d and in a \u201cchaotic way,\u201d some U.S. citizens may get caught in the immigration dragnet. For instance, some could end up wrongly classified as dead and their Social Security numbers put in the agency's death file, she said.",
      "\"Are they going to do the same thing they are doing with Kilmar [Abrego Garcia] of saying, 'Oops, sorry, we made a mistake and we can't do anything about it now'?\""

      "CHICAGO \u2014\u00a0Former President Joe Biden used his first public remarks since he left office in January to rebuke the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Social Security, saying its cuts were already putting the institution in peril for millions of deserving Americans.",
      "In roughly a half-hour of remarks Tuesday before disability advocates, Biden \u2014 often speaking in a subdued, hushed tone \u2014 did not mention President Donald Trump by name, referring to him instead as \u201cthis guy,\u201d and held back from robust criticism of the administration.",
      "Biden more broadly took aim at Trump's tenure so far, saying that in \u201cfewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much ... damage and so much destruction. It\u2019s kind of breathtaking.\u201d",
      "\"We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. Like I said, I've been doing this a long time. It's never been this divided,\" Biden said. \"Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart.\"",
      "It's not clear what group of people the 30% remark referred to.",
      "White House spokesman Steven Cheung sharply criticized Biden, saying his \"incoherent speech\" showed he had a \"feeble mind\" in a \"rapid decline to new lows.\"",
      "\"President Trump has repeatedly promised to protect Social Security and ensure higher take-home pay for seniors by ending the taxation of Social Security benefits. Anybody saying otherwise is either stupid or an all-out liar, or both in Biden\u2019s case,\" Cheung said in a statement.",
      "After his election, Trump told NBC News that \u201cwe\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d other than to make it more efficient. But since Trump took taking office, billionaire Elon Musk has cut staffing at the agency. Musk also prompted a flare-up among Trump allies after he called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "Biden referred to the comment Tuesday.",
      "\"We heard others, empowered and emboldened by this administration, talk about Social Security; one of them called it a Ponzi scheme,\" Biden said. \"A Ponzi scheme \u2014 what the hell are they talking about? People earn these benefits. They paid into that benefit. They rely on that benefit. And no one, no one, no one should take it away.\"",
      "Biden also referred to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 also without naming him \u2014 painting him as detached from the average American. Biden cited comments Lutnick has made that his mother-in-law wouldn\u2019t complain if she didn\u2019t get her next Social Security check.",
      "\u201cThe current secretary of commerce doesn\u2019t seem to get it, or based on his comments, he doesn\u2019t seem to even care,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe said his 94-year-old mother-in-law wouldn\u2019t complain. Wouldn\u2019t bother her. She\u2019s probably a lovely woman. No kidding. Her-son-in-law is a billionaire. What about that 94-year-old mother living all by herself? Don\u2019t have a billionaire in the family. All the retirees who depend on that monthly check to feed themselves. All those people with disabilities have no other source. What about all those?\u201d",
      "Despite a regular churn of verbal abuse from Trump, it was the first time Biden has spoken publicly since he left the White House on Jan. 20. But on Tuesday, he did not offer a defense of himself or his own administration.",
      "At times, it was difficult to hear Biden \u2014 so much so that those in the room at the event remained still and quiet to hear him speak.",
      "Shortly after the speech, Trump put up a post on Truth Social, featuring a clipped video of Biden during the speech, saying, \"I had never seen, I'd never seen hardly any Black people in Scranton at the time, and I was only going on fourth grade. And I remember seeing the kids going by \u2014 at the time, called colored kids \u2014 on a bus going by.\"",
      "In context Trump left out, Biden went on to say that the fact that the bus went to a different school \u201csparked his outrage\u201d as a kid and inspired him to get involved in politics.",
      "Trump routinely chastises Biden, having called him \u201cthe worst president in American history.\u201d He frequently characterizes Biden\u2019s tenure as a mess that his administration must now clean up, particularly with regard to border security. In the earliest days of his second term, Trump repeatedly blamed lagging economic indicators on Biden. Soon, however, it was Trump\u2019s own topsy-turvy tariff policies that threw the stock market into disarray.",
      "Biden spoke to a conference for Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled at the Sofitel Hotel on Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile. The meeting focused on strengthening Social Security at a moment when the Trump administration has set its sights on revamping the agency in a way that beneficiaries fear could put them in peril.",
      "Last month, Biden spoke at a National High Schools Model United Nations event, but the speech it was not open to members of the media.",
      "Biden, 82, left office deeply at odds with his own party, which pressured him to abandon his re-election bid in the wake of a devastating presidential debate against Trump in June, when Biden struggled at times to express a clear thought. The debacle aggravated long-standing concerns about his age and mental capacity.",
      "Biden\u2019s vice president, Kamala Harris, claimed the Democratic nomination and embarked on a whirlwind, 107-day campaign against Trump that shattered fundraising records, offering fleeting hope to the party. Ultimately, Harris went on to lose to Trump, including in each of six battleground states, as well as the popular vote.",
      "In January, Biden said in an interview that he believed he could have defeated Trump had he run again \u2014 but at the same time, he admitted in the USA Today interview that he was unsure he could have served out a full term."

      "Multiple New York prison guards have been indicted in connection with the \u201cdisturbing\u201d death of an inmate last month during a wildcat officers\u2019 strike, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday.",
      "Messiah Nantwi, a prisoner at the Mid-State Correctional Facility, died at a hospital March 1 following what other prisoners said was a severe beating by several guards.",
      "At the time, the state\u2019s prisons were in a state of crisis caused by the walkout of thousands of prison personnel during an unauthorized 22-day strike that had forced the governor to call in the National Guard.",
      "\u201cThe tragic death of Mr. Nantwi at the hands of correction officers who are responsible for protecting the incarcerated population is deeply, deeply disturbing,\u201d Hochul said in a brief video message.",
      "The governor didn\u2019t immediately say how many guards had been indicted or reveal details about the charges. Her office did not respond to an email seeking more information.",
      "A special prosecutor investigating Nantwi\u2019s death, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, said earlier Tuesday that a \u201cnoteworthy development\u201d in the case will be presented to a judge in Utica on Wednesday \u2014 a signal that criminal charges might be imminent.",
      "The Rev. Kevin McCall, a spokesperson for Nantwi\u2019s relatives, said family members planned on attending.",
      "The New York Times interviewed multiple inmates at the prison who reported that Nantwi was severely beaten by correctional officers before he died.",
      "The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a court filing last month there was \u201cprobable cause to believe\u201d that as many as nine correctional officers either caused or could be implicated in Nantwi\u2019s death.",
      "Prison officials said Tuesday that seven officers have resigned in the wake of Nantwi\u2019s death and 11 have been suspended without pay.",
      "The special prosecutor\u2019s office declined Tuesday to provide details on the new development. Fitzpatrick, who had said he would not comment on the case until a grand jury took action, has scheduled a news conference for 3:30 p.m. Wednesday following the court appearance.",
      "Nantwi\u2019s death came several months after another inmate, Robert Brooks, was fatally beaten at another prison, the Marcy Correctional Facility, that sits across the street from the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Six guards were charged with murder, three with manslaughter and one with evidence tampering in Brooks\u2019 death. They have pleaded not guilty, and their cases are pending.",
      "Correctional officers upset over working conditions began illegally walking off the job Feb. 17 at many state prisons. Incarcerated people and their advocates complained that services and conditions deteriorated during the walkout.",
      "The strike ended when many guards returned to work and Hochul fired the remaining 2,000 holdouts.",
      "Nantwi entered the state prison system last May and had been serving a five-year sentence for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon related to an exchange of gunfire with police officers in 2021. At the time, he was shot multiple times, while the officers were uninjured.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors say Nantwi shot and killed Jaylen Duncan, 19, on a Harlem street in April 2023. The following evening, they say, he shot and killed Brandon Brunson, 36, at a Harlem smoke shop after an argument."

      "In a heartwarming show of community spirit, the small town of Chelsea, Michigan, pulled off a literary feat worthy of its own novel.",
      "When the beloved local bookstore Serendipity Books announced it was moving to a larger space, owner Michelle Tuplin was faced with a logistical challenge: how to move 9,100 books \u2014 and hundreds of boxes \u2014 without closing the business for days.",
      "\"People really consider independent bookstores theirs,\" Tuplin said Tuesday. \"It\u2019s really a part of the community, and they have ownership.\"",
      "So she came up with a novel idea.",
      "Tuplin put out a call for volunteers, hoping some might lend a hand. What she got was a full-on movement \u2014 a human conveyor belt stretching 350 feet from the old store\u2019s stockroom, around the corner and into the new location.",
      "More than 300 people \u2014 and one very good dog \u2014 showed up to help. Neighbors, customers and even passersby joined in, forming two human chains to get the job done.",
      "\u201cIt was just a joyful experience,\u201d said Donna Zak, one of the volunteers. \u201cWe were passing the books and noticing and commenting to each other, \u2018Oh, have you read this one? I really enjoyed this one!\u2019\u201d",
      "In less than two hours, Serendipity Books\u2019 entire inventory had been transferred \u2014 in alphabetical order, no less.",
      "\u201cThere was a 91-year-old woman. There was a good customer who has issues with his heart. There was somebody with their 6-year-old child. And we figured if we just did it book by book, everybody could be involved,\u201d Tuplin said.",
      "The new storefront, which is more than twice the size of the old one, will open later this month ahead of Independent Bookstore Day on April 26, a celebration of indie shops and the communities that support them.",
      "\u201cTo see the community come out and, you know, put all those words that they say, usually say, into action, it truly just meant the world,\u201d Tuplin said. \u201cIt was overwhelming.\u201d",
      "It was proof that the written word, at least in one Michigan town, is alive and well. Sometimes, all it takes to spark a little magic is a shared love of books \u2014 and a willingness to pass it on."

    "story": [
      "Two Mississippi Capitol Police officers have been charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a young father during a 2022 traffic stop, part of a string of shootings by officers in an aggressive push to stamp out spiking crime in Jackson.",
      "A grand jury in Hinds County indicted the officers, Michael Rhinewalt and Stephen Frederick, last month. Rhinewalt is on unpaid administrative leave; Frederick resigned from the Capitol Police in March 2023 after a drunken driving arrest.",
      "Rhinewalt was arrested last week and released on $100,000 bond; his indictment was unsealed Monday. His defense lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "Frederick has not yet been arrested, and it is not clear when or whether he would surrender to authorities, nor was it clear whether he had an attorney who could speak about the charges. After he left the Capitol Police, Frederick went to work for the Scott County Sheriff\u2019s Office; it was unclear Tuesday whether he remained employed there.",
      "The Capitol Police are a state-run force that had been largely responsible for security at state government buildings until 2022, when the governor deployed officers to help with spiking crime. The charges Tuesday are the third case in which a current or former officer has been accused of wrongdoing during that effort.",
      "Rhinewalt and Frederick have been charged with shooting Jaylen Lewis, 25, during what authorities said at the time was \u201ca police response to a traffic violation.\u201d",
      "Lewis\u2019 mother has long maintained that officers wrongly shot her son and has sought justice since the shooting.",
      "Rhinewalt, Frederick and other members of the Capitol Police\u2019s crime suppression unit, called Flex, were conducting a drug narcotics operation around 9 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2022, and saw a white Jeep Grand Cherokee run a red light, according to an incident report provided in response to a public records request.",
      "The officers opened fire after they tried to pull over the Jeep, but details of the encounter were redacted from the report at the time. A death certificate later confirmed that Lewis, the father of a 4-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy, had been shot in the head.",
      "Rhinewalt and Frederick said they fired on Lewis in self-defense, according to the indictment, but the grand jury concluded it \"was not a reasonable belief under the circumstances.\"",
      "Lewis was one of four people Capitol Police shot in the first six months of their 2022 deployment to Jackson. The victims included Sherita Harris, a mother of five who was struck in the head while she was riding in a car that Rhinewalt and another officer, Jeffery Walker, fired on during a chase on Aug. 14, 2022. Rhinewalt and Walker were indicted in December on aggravated assault charges in that shooting.",
      "A federal grand jury also indicted Walker, who left the Capitol Police in July 2023, in December on civil rights charges alleging he beat a motorist after a 2022 pursuit.",
      "Rhinewalt and Walker have pleaded not guilty in those cases.",
      "In another shooting by Capitol Police, Latasha Smith was struck in the arm in her apartment on Dec. 11, 2022, as police opened fire on a suspected car thief outside. State authorities have deemed the shooting justified.",
      "In the wake of the barrage, NBC News found that the Capitol Police had deployed the officers to Jackson without modernizing policies to reflect their new mission. In 2023, the agency quietly revised its rules on use of force. It also now equips officers with body cameras and dashboard cameras.",
      "But the Capitol Police have also amassed more power, broadening their jurisdiction to the entire city, from beyond a district surrounding downtown Jackson. Most elected leaders in the Democratic-run city opposed the measure, but state Republicans made it law."

      "As the two largest economies in the world \u2014 the United States and China \u2014 continue to spar over tariffs, the escalating trade war is  spurring some Americans to favor Chinese goods in ways they never did before.",
      "President Donald Trump has said his sweeping tariffs around the globe are aimed at bringing manufacturing back to American shores. But as he continues to target China with his highest tariff yet, now at 145%, some Americans online say they are flocking to Chinese manufacturing rather than away from it.",
      "\u201cWhat do American companies think we\u2019re gonna do? We\u2019re gonna pay their prices rather than Chinese prices, when I can get a thousand times more product for the same price as we get here?\u201d a TikTok user said in a video that got more than 16.5 million views. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do that.\u201d",
      "Since Friday, videos on TikTok from Chinese manufacturers have drawn millions of views touting a wide variety of goods \u2014\u00a0including some making questionable claims about their roles in producing high-priced luxury items that say they\u2019re made in Europe. Others tout dupes, or replicas, of common brand-name items that they say are of the same or similar quality.",
      "The videos come as the United States imposes high tariffs on China and plans to close a trade loophole, called de minimis, that allows shipments under $800 to enter the country without taxes. Domestic and international discontent over Trump\u2019s trade policy has spilled over into the internet, where artificial intelligence videos that appear to show Americans working in factories and various other memes have flourished.",
      "Much of the content is surfacing on TikTok even as it faces an uncertain future in the United States. Having emerged as by far the most popular Chinese-owned social media app, it could be banned if its Beijing-based parent company doesn\u2019t divest ownership by June 15.",
      "Tony Wu, founder of the family business TLucky Sourcing, works behind the scenes with several popular Chinese factory sourcing accounts on TikTok. He said the accounts are using global social media platforms to advertise various Chinese suppliers to buyers, whether from the United States or elsewhere.",
      "The tariffs \u201cmake some troubles, for sure, but in two or three months it\u2019ll go back to normal, I think,\u201d said Wu, who connects with factories to find retail and individual buyers abroad. \u201cWe will find new buyers. And [Americans] cannot replace the China factory. Finally I think they will realize that they need to buy from China. ... There are no alternatives.\u201d",
      "Americans make up only around 5% of buyers for the factories he works with, he said, and those factories have much bigger export markets in South Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. So far, Wu said, American buyers aren\u2019t canceling orders but are instead opting for smaller orders or trying to negotiate prices.",
      "\u201cHonestly, America is not our main market. TikTok\u2019s just based in America \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean our customers are mainly from America,\u201d he said. He said that while he believes Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t be detrimental to Chinese exports, manufacturers are growing nervous about the sheer unpredictability of his trade policies.",
      "Many of the videos claimed the Chinese suppliers behind popular brands sell the same or similar pieces at much cheaper prices.",
      "\u201cThey sell you a legging pants for $100, and guess what? Here in these two factories, you can get them for around $5 to $6,\u201d @LunaSourcingChina, an account that works with Wu\u2019s sourcing business, said in a video that got more than 11 million views on TikTok. \u201cAnd what\u2019s even better, the material and the craftsmanship are basically the same because they all come from the same production line.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Lululemon, one of the brands mentioned in the video, said it \u201cdoes not work with the manufacturers identified in the online videos and we urge consumers to be aware of potentially counterfeit products and misinformation.\u201d",
      "Another TikTok account that gained traction this week, @senbags2, claimed his factory has been the original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, for most of the world\u2019s luxury bags for over 30 years. He claimed that by discreetly making bags in China before they are shipped to Europe for final touches, \u201cthe bags will appear at their boutiques as \u2018made in Italy\u2019 or \u2018made in France.\u2019\u201d",
      "In a video that caused heavy debate online, he claimed that a $38,000 Hermes Birkin handbag costs around $1,400 to make in a Chinese factory using the same high-quality materials. Hermes is well-known for crafting its Birkin bags exclusively in France, dedicating a single artisan to each bag.",
      "A spokesperson for Hermes didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Even as many online remained skeptical about the claims made in the trending warehouse videos, the discourse has raised questions about the true material value of Western name-brand goods.",
      "Chinese-made dupes of expensive luxury brands have been popular among American consumers for years \u2014 often sold by street vendors and on Chinese e-commerce sites like DHGate \u2014 but they\u2019ve long carried a stigma of being perceived as low-quality. What the recent videos from Chinese manufacturers purport, however, is that the knockoffs are equal in everything but the value of their names.",
      "As viral videos invited shoppers abroad to buy directly from the Chinese warehouses instead of paying top prices for Western brand logos, they generated a flurry of shock and glee among Americans who say they\u2019re looking to purchase cheaper wholesale goods that might save them enough money to offset Trump\u2019s tariffs on China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, some online have been pointing out that much of Trump\u2019s own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise is made in China, as well. Others have noted that for most things Americans consume \u2014 even, for example, a Florida tangerine \u2014\u00a0moving full production processes to the United States would be highly inefficient and expensive.",
      "Among those calling out the Chinese-made MAGA merch is a Chinese journalist who shared a video last weekend showing that inside the Trump Tower store in New York City, price tag stickers appeared to be placed in a way that covered up the \u201cMade in China\u201d label on several products. Though his video made waves in China, a visit to the store by NBC News didn\u2019t find anything that appeared to be purposefully trying to obfuscate its origins.",
      "Zhang Zhisheng, China\u2019s consul general in Denpasar, Indonesia, also accused White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt of wearing a Chinese-made dress, writing on X: \u201cAccusing China is business. Buying China is life.\u201d",
      "Many people online appear unconvinced by Chinese knockoffs of their favorite brands. But as such content circulates on Chinese and American social media platforms alike, some users, including Americans, are mocking Trump\u2019s tariffs as fears grow about a trade war that\u2019s potentially more disadvantageous to the United States than to China."

      "Democrats\u2019 plan of action: Democratic lawmakers say they are willing to go to El Salvador to seek Abrego Garcia\u2019s release, a plan that has gained steam after the country\u2019s president said during a visit to the White House on Monday that he would not send the man back to the U.S., Megan Lebowitz and Frank Thorp V report.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., sent a letter Monday to El Salvador\u2019s ambassador in the U.S. requesting a meeting with the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, who said in meeting with Trump later in the day that he \u201cof course\u201d would not send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.",
      "Van Hollen said if Abrego Garcia was not in the U.S. by \u201cmidweek,\u201d he would \u201ctravel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release.\u201d",
      "The idea gained support from several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, who said they would be willing to join Van Hollen on the trip.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, also sought to dial up the pressure on Republicans.",
      "\u201cNow is the time for my Republican colleagues to step up,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cYou can no longer stay silent in the face of a constitutional crisis.

      "Zooming out: Trump administration officials are pushing immigrants to leave the United States of their own volition, or \u201cself deport,\u201d as the number of people the government is deporting from the interior of the country remains stagnant, far below the vision for mass deportations promised by the president, Julia Ainsley reports.",

      "The hurdles Kamala Harris faces in a potential comeback attempt",
      "The possibility that Kamala Harris might seek a quick comeback in next year\u2019s California governor\u2019s race continues to be raised.",
      "Since leaving office, Harris\u2019 camp has signaled interest in a potential candidacy. Two weeks ago, the former vice president used a speech in her home state to declare, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d And recent polls suggest the state\u2019s Democratic voters retain broadly positive feelings toward her.",
      "Harris\u2019 ultimate decision is a key variable for national Democrats, since she would also be a logical candidate for the party\u2019s 2028 presidential nomination. On Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, a potential presidential candidate himself, sidestepped questions about another Harris White House bid.",
      "Between the two options, the California governorship seems the obviously more attainable goal for Harris, given her familiarity to voters and the state\u2019s overwhelming Democratic bent. Among Democratic voters, polls show she\u2019d be the top choice for now, but the field is still forming and name recognition is a major factor.",
      "The state\u2019s open primary system adds another variable. Candidates all run on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election. That raises the possibility that, if Harris advanced to a general election for California governor, she might have to face a fellow Democrat.",
      "In theory, that could be a concern against a candidate like Rick Caruso, a wealthy businessman who sought Los Angeles\u2019s mayoralty in 2022 with a campaign that emphasized crime, homelessness and quality-of-life issues. A former Republican, Caruso has been visible in the aftermath of this winter\u2019s devastating fires and could appeal to voters on both sides of the aisle \u2014 if he were to run and make it to the general election.",
      "There\u2019s also some uncomfortable history here for Harris, who would not be the first former VP to lose a presidential race only to turn around and seek California\u2019s top job. Richard Nixon had been a senator and congressman from California before becoming Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s No. 2.",
      "After narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy in the race to succeed Ike, Nixon threw himself into the 1962 California governor\u2019s race. At first, it seemed like a cinch: A July 1961 poll found him 16 points ahead of the incumbent Democrat, Pat Brown. Nixon saw it as a chance to put a win on the board before running for president again in 1964, but those early sentiments from the electorate gave way to a comeback victory by Brown, who defeated Nixon by 6 points.",
      "Since then, two other vice presidents have sought to revive their careers after losing White House bids. Hubert Humphrey, who as Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s VP lost to Nixon in 1968, won back a U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota in 1970. Like Nixon in California, Humphrey was still dreaming of the presidency, but he was a deeply admired figure in Minnesota and the outcome was never in doubt.",
      "Minnesota was also the setting for Walter Mondale\u2019s extremely brief, late-in-life comeback effort in 2002. The former VP, who\u2019d been crushed by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election, was recruited by Democrats as an emergency candidate following the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone in a plane crash. Mondale entered the race a week before Election Day and lost narrowly to Republican Norm Coleman.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:44:21 GMT",
    "summary": "After the Trump administration announced a $2.2 billion freeze on grants to Harvard, some critics have questioned why it can\u2019t just make up for federal funding with endowments.",
    "story": [
      "So why can\u2019t Harvard just dip further into its famously steep endowment?",
      "As the Trump administration announced a $2.2 billion freeze in grants to the university this week after the school rejected its demands, some critics have questioned why the Ivy League institution and other wealthy schools like it can\u2019t just make up for federal funding that way.",
      "Finance and higher education experts say endowments aren\u2019t a simple replacement for government funding because of restrictions related to donor earmarking, legality and research priorities.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a major source of revenue that has disappeared, which is the threat from the administration, it\u2019s like any family with a shock to their income stream,\u201d said Catharine Bond Hill, former president of Vassar College. \u201cYou\u2019d have to decide how you were going to allocate your spending priorities.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration said in a statement Monday that it would cut the $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and $60 million \u201cin multi-year contract value\u201d to Harvard because of what it considers the university\u2019s \u201ctroubling entitlement mindset.\u201d",
      "The freeze was announced hours after the school said it wouldn\u2019t concede to the administration\u2019s demands, which include auditing viewpoints of the student body and restricting the acceptance of international students who are \u201chostile to the American values and institutions.",
      "\u201cThe university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\u201d the university\u2019s X account said in a statement Monday. \u201cNeither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.\u201d",
      "Harvard has the largest endowment among U.S. universities, at $53.2 billion in 2024. That is higher than the gross domestic products of almost 100 countries. Yale University has the second-highest endowment, hovering around $41.4 billion.",
      "But those elite schools don\u2019t represent the norm. A 2024 National Association of College and University Business Officers study of 658 U.S. colleges and universities found that the median endowment was $243 million. And 30% of the participating universities had endowments of $100 million or less.",
      "While Harvard no doubt has substantial funding, it doesn\u2019t mean it can rely on its endowment to make up for loss, experts say. Hill, managing director of the research and consulting organization Ithaka S+R, compared the endowment to a pot of financial assets that are invested in a variety of things, from stocks and bonds to real estate.",
      "Much of that pot of money, Hill said, comes from donors, including alumni, foundations, local community members or anyone else looking to support the institutions\u2019 spending. And it\u2019s not to be used immediately.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t give it as a pot of money to be spent this year,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey give it as an endowment, so that the earnings can be used over time to support the thing that the donor is interested in the university doing in perpetuity.\u201d",
      "There are also other restrictions. Liz Clark, vice president of policy at the college business officers group, said that essentially, endowments can be seen as a \u201ccollection of contracts\u201d with donors.",
      "\u201cDonors may have given to support scholarships, they may have given to support faculty positions, perhaps they donated to support a specific area of scientific inquiry or medical research,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe university has a legal responsibility to uphold that contract and agreement.\u201d",
      "At Harvard, for example, donor terms direct 70% of the annual distribution of its endowment to specific programs or departments or other purposes. That leaves around 25%, Hill said, for discretionary spending approved by the board. It\u2019s still a large amount; however, Hill said that \u201cyou can burn through that pretty quickly.\u201d And the school may have to make financial trade-offs.",
      "\u201cThat board-designated money may have been earmarked to support need-based financial aid for undergraduates,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIf they spend it down on covering this research shortfall, they can certainly do it for a while, but when it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. It may mean that they have to reduce spending in some other areas where that money was being used.\u201d",
      "Federal funding has also historically played a critical role in research, experts said. Cecilia Orphan, an associate professor of higher education at the University of Denver, said the funding often comes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Arts and other major agencies.",
      "And those sources often come with national strategic priorities attached to them, Orphan said. The National Science Foundation, for example, has been making concerted efforts to increase the country\u2019s competitiveness in STEM, she said.",
      "When a university receives a grant, Orphan said, it is usually broken up in a variety of ways to support things like materials for research, staffing costs or construction of physical spaces to conduct research.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult for a university like Harvard or Columbia to conduct that kind of cutting-edge research without that kind of infrastructural support that is separate from the actual research itself,\u201d Orphan said.",
      "Experts say it remains to be seen how universities will adapt to such federal funding freezes. But, Orphan said, the impact on research could be devastating.",
      "\u201cThe larger implication here is a university like Harvard is doing research that has global benefit across a variety of areas, including cancer research and weapons development and other strategic concerns that we might have as a country and the world has,\u201d Orphan said. \u201cWhen you cut the research funding, that means that research will cease or it will be greatly diminished.\u201d"

      "\u201cThere are some saucy debates on the internet right now,\u201d Jenna says at the start of the chat. After discussing Ayesha Curry and wedding budgeting, the hosts chat about whether it\u2019s OK to fake a proposal to get free stuff.",
      "\u201cHer man got down on one knee and proposed, but the plot twist was they\u2019re already married, this is not a real proposal,\u201d Arianna Davis, TODAY.com editorial director, told Banks and Jenna as a video of a mischievous couple receiving applause from restaurant-goers played on screen.",
      "Back on March 6, Los Angeles, California resident Jaela Bumpas posted a video to X showing the prank she and her husband pulled at a resort restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii to get a couple of free margaritas, and it went viral, garnering over 38 million views.",
      "It also amassed thousands of comments, with some comparing the action to \u201ctheft,\u201d while others felt like the couple just had a good \u201csense of humor.\u201d",
      "So, what did Jenna and Banks have to say about the prank?",
      "\u201cOK, so my mom had a birthday many years ago, and we were in Dubai with my man, and he proceeded to say her birthday was going on for two weeks,\u201d Banks said. \u201cAnd for two weeks, it was people coming in with flowers and cakes and the fire and the Champagne.\u201d",
      "Banks then hid her head in her hands in mock-embarrassment to show as she recalled the fibbery.",
      "\u201cSo guilty, family,\u201d she said. \u201cSuper guilty.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve done it,\u201d Jenna chimed in.",
      "\u201cYou have?\u201d Tyra exclaimed in surprise.",
      "\u201cWell, my cousin pretended to propose to me, which sounds nasty,\u201d Jenna said as laughter filled the room. A throwback photo is shown of Jenna and her cousin Sam LeBlond, who co-hosted in March.",
      "\u201cLook! That\u2019s us!\u201d she continued. \u201cWe look like a couple, don\u2019t we?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Banks said with a chuckle. \u201cHe looks like your cousin.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t 18. We did it kind of for laughs \u2014 and for dessert,\u201d Jenna said.",
      "Although an overwhelming majority of TODAY readers disagreed with faking a celebration to get something for free, Jenna remained unfazed.",
      "\u201cBy the way, everybody\u2019s faked a birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re honest.\u201d"

      "Wood was spotted crying in the arms of Ralph Davis \u2014 who she is collaborating with on an upcoming project called \"Film Club\" \u2014 in the streets of London on April 14. Davis held Wood with one arm while she cried. In one photo, she turned her forehead to his chest as she sobbed, while multiple other photos captured her wiping away tears.",
      "Speculation immediately emerged that Wood's tears were due to a recent \"SNL\" sketch that mocked her teeth. However, on April 15, Wood posted on her Instagram story that she \"actually wasn't crying about anything that the papers made out. I was crying about something completely unrelated.\"",

Shame on SNL for their cruelty. I'm so glad you spoke up.\"",

      "During the show's April 12 episode, \"SNL\" aired a skit called \"The White Potus,\" which placed President Donald J. Trump, his cabinet and family in the shoes of characters from the hit HBO show. While many of the characters modeled Trump or his administration, some were exaggerated versions of characters on the show.",
      "Cast member Sarah Sherman played Wood's character, Chelsea, in the skit with a set of fake teeth which were shown as Jon Hamm, who played Robert F. Kennedy Jr., discussed taking fluoride out of drinking water.",
      "On April 13, Wood posted a selfie on her Instagram story explaining her distaste for the spoof.",
      "\"But whilst in honest mode \u2014 I did find the SNL thing mean and unfunny xo,\" she wrote. \"(Felt righteous might delete later x).\"",
      "In another Instagram story, she expressed that she wished \"SNL\" went a \u201ccleverer, more nuanced, less cheap\u201d route when spoofing her character.",

      "\"On a positive note, everyone is agreeing with me about it so I\u2019m glad I said something instead of going in on myself,\" she wrote in a separate Instagram story.",

      "Things were, as they are often in \u201cOC\u201d land, rather unstable.",

      "(Peacock is part of our parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Christopher Meloni (Detective Elliot Stabler)",
      "Last season, Elliot\u2019s family, which had always been a big part of his life, grew even bigger. With the addition of his brothers, Randall (Dean Norris) and Joe \"Joey\" Jr. (Michael Trotter), and return of Mama Bernadette \u201cBernie\u201d Stabler (Ellen Burstyn), in addition to Stabler's many children, in-laws and grandchildren, suddenly \u201cOC\u201d became a lot more like \u201cThe Stabler Clan.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe family is involved,\u201d Meloni told TODAY.com in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m always pushing for more of that. I like that dynamic and I think the audience does, too.\u201d",
      "Appearances by Stabler\u2019s children, whom he had with wife Kathy Stabler (Isabel Gillies) before her death in his 2021 return \u201cSVU\u201d episode, are also likely. But it's not yet clear when Maureen (Autumn Mirassou), Dickie (Jeffrey Scaperrotta), Lizzie (Kaitlyn Davidson) and Kathleen (Allison Siko) may pop up. The youngest of the bunch, daddy-to-be Eli (Nicky Torchia), can be seen in a photo from the new season, so expect some scenes with him.",
      "What\u2019s missing? A new life partner for the elder Stabler. Many fans want Capt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay, most often seen on \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d) to fill that role. Well, whether or not that will ever happens remains to be seen, but there is some good news for Bensler fans. Olivia will be coming over for a visit to \u201cOC\u201d in Episode Two of the new season.",
      "For those just coming into this aspect of the drama, Benson and Stabler were partners for many years on \u201cSVU,\u201d but Stabler left the \u201cL&O\u201d-verse after 12 seasons before coming back in 2021 for \u201cOC.\u201d While the two have never been in a romantic relationship, they\u2019re about as close as two people can be without having been in one.",
      "Meanwhile, Stabler continues to anticipate his next grandchild\u2019s arrival, throw himself into his work and keep his famous temper in check. (Last season he underwent a brief suspension after getting physical with a minor.)",
      "Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt (Sgt. Ayanna Bell)",
      "Stabler may be the focus in \u201cOC,\u201d but Bell leads the unit. Recently divorced and helping to raise her son, Jack, she\u2019s been in charge since the show debuted and oversees the cases with strong will and a cool head. (Much needed in this group.) She also partners with Stabler as well as supervising the unit \u2014 and last season ended up shot by a gang leader\u2019s son. (She\u2019s OK.)",
      "The new trailer for \u201cOC\u201d shows Bell sending Stabler undercover, which leads to him being injured as a truck smashes the vehicle he's driving. The repercussions of this incident are likely to reverberate throughout multiple episodes, so expect Bell to have big thoughts on that event.",
      "Season Five may be even more active for Bell. Truitt recently told TODAY.com that after feeling like the \u201cmama bear\u201d in the unit, she informed the showrunner at the time that she\u2019d like to do more than that. \u201cI feel like her function as a leader is beyond just trying to protect everybody all the time, and mothering everybody all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Ainsley Seiger (Detective Jet Slootmaekers)",
      "Solving crimes doesn\u2019t always happen on the street, which means the OC unit needs a brilliant computer hacker-type genius back in the office. For them, it\u2019s the youthful Slootmaekers, who can chase down elusive criminals for the unit. But Slootmaekers can go undercover with the best of them when needed.",
      "Seiger, whose character is also known for her deadpan sense of humor, occasionally posts pictures from the show on Instagram, and in February 2023 she wrote, \u201cCan\u2019t really articulate what this arc has meant to me so i will save it for my diary and maintain an air of mystery and allure.... but know that i am very very muchly grateful.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Slootmaekers and colleague Detective Bobby Reyes (Rick Gonzalez) began having a surprising affair, which was revealed early on in Season Four. The whole thing started while they were dealing with their grief after the death of their co-worker Detective Jamie Whelan (Brent Antonello), who died in the Season Three finale. The relationship fizzled out over the course of last season, and the two agreed to be friends.",
      "Rick Gonzalez (Detective Bobby Reyes)",
      "A former foster care child, Reyes wasn\u2019t an original member of the OC unit, but since he signed on in Season Three, he\u2019s become a fan favorite. The force works best when they have top undercover folks, and Reyes has proved to be just that \u2014 in more ways than one.",
      "Called \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d by his co-workers because of his ability to transform into whatever deep cover character he needs to be, he first met the others in the unit by pretending to be an electrician at the interview, listening in on their discussion of the investigation \u2014 then announced himself. That\u2019s a way to make an entrance!",
      "\u201cHe can be nobody and everybody at the same time, and that\u2019s going to be useful for the unit,\u201d Gonazalez told TODAY.com in 2022.",
      "That said, Reyes\u2019 undercover activities were a bit more figurative early in Season Four, when viewers learned that he \u2014 a married man \u2014 slept with co-worker Slootmaekers. They called off the affair shortly after. He later revealed he\u2019d signed divorce papers and took a leave of absence.",
      "Dean Norris (Randall Stabler)",
      "Divorced and until recently living in Florida, Randall visited his younger brother Elliot in Season Four, helping out at a family dinner with much of the extended Stabler family attending. But the brothers started arguing when Randall revealed the real reason he left home when Elliot was younger. Randall explained he was the one who called Internal Affairs on their dad, Joe Sr., a former police officer, to inform them about \"all the nastiness\" Joe Sr. was involved in. When Elliot asked why, Randall said their father used to beat their mother \u201con a nightly basis.\u201d",
      "Randall also got caught up in Elliot's work life after they learned younger brother Joe Jr. got caught up in drugs with a bad group of men, and the two tried staged an intervention for their brother.",
      "In Season Five, Randall will also cross paths with another person close to Elliot: Benson.",
      "Norris joked in an interview with TODAY.com that Elliot is \"nervous that Randall might be trying to hit on Benson.\"",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s feeling a little jealous,\u201d Norris continues. \u201cI think me and Mariska have a little thing. I mean, just saying!\u201d",
      "The first two episodes of \"Law & Order: Organized Crime\" Season Five premiere April 17 on Peacock. New episodes will stream weekly."

      "While the internet is buzzing with theories on what happened between the cast members, Jason Isaacs has a message for \u201camateur Sherlock Holmes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d the actor, who portrayed businessman and father Timothy, said on an April 9 episode of SiriusXM\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Happy Hour.\u201d \u201cNobody has the slightest clue what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",

      "Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood",
      "Internet sleuths began speculating about the status of Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood's relationship after they paid tribute to their characters, as well as their experience on \"The White Lotus,\" without tagging each other.",
      "In his April 6 post about their characters on Instagram, Goggins did shout out Wood, writing, \u201cThank you Aimee Lou for being my partner\u2026 a journey I will never forget.\u201d Wood posted a photo of her with Goggins on April 8 with the caption, \u201cA perfect storm.\u201d",
      "The two are not following each other on Instagram, but follow other \"White Lotus\" Season 3 cast members. Goggins also previously had a slideshow of photos with Wood pinned to his Highlights on Instagram, which is no longer available to view.",
      "Fans took note of the lack of tags and follows. \u201cWhy did you unfollow each other?\u201d one person asked on Goggins' post.",
      "Additionally, Goggins and Wood had different reactions to the divisive April 12 \u201cSNL\u201d political spoof called\u00a0\u201cThe White Potus.\u201d\u00a0The sketch was a political take on the Trump administration and poked fun at Wood by having cast member Sarah Sherman wear prosthetic teeth.",
      "Wood called out the sketch and called it \u201cmean and unfunny.\u201d Meanwhile, Goggins commented that the sketch amazing on the \u201cSNL\u201d Instagram account.",
      "\u201cHahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,\u201d he wrote in a since-deleted comment.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Wood and Goggins for comment.",
      "Creator Mike White and composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer",
      "Composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer said in a New York Times\u00a0that he was quitting and not returning for the show\u2019s fourth season. The creative said that he had been having disagreements with Mike White since the show\u2019s first season, which aired in 2021.",
      "He recalled people being \u201cfurious\u201d about the change of the theme song for Season 3, which didn\u2019t include the fan-favorite \u201cooh-loo-loo-loos.\u201d",
      "\u201cI texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy about that.\u201d",
      "Tapia de Veer added, \u201cI mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything.\u201d He then uploaded his longer version to his YouTube.",
      "White, on his end, responded to Tapia de Veer quitting, saying an\u00a0interview with Howard Stern\u00a0on April 8, that he \"honestly\" didn't know what happened.",
      "\u201cExcept now I\u2019m reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,\u201d White said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he respected me.\u201d",
      "White claimed that they \u201cnever really even fought\u201d and said the composer \u201cwasn\u2019t a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0to s--- on me and the show three days before the finale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a b---- move.\u201d",
      "Jason Isaacs stirs the pot with his comments across interviews",
      "In an interview with The Guardian, published in February 2025, Isaacs called the set \u201ca theater camp,\u201d as well as \u201can open prison camp.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t avoid one other. There are tensions and difficulties, I don\u2019t know if they spilled from on screen to off-screen, or if it would have happened anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were alliances that formed and broke, romances that formed and broke, friendships that formed and broke. It\u2019s a long period of time for people to be away from their family with an open bar and all the wildness being in Thailand allows.\u201d",
      "He then got candid about the instances that even White and producer David Bernad witnessed.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t pretend I wasn\u2019t involved in some off-screen drama,\" Isaacs said. \"I can\u2019t speak for them, but I imagine they think it feeds into the on-screen drama, and they might well be right. I think the heat contributed to these fissures appearing.\"",
      "At the time, the actor believed that they would put their differences behind them at the premiere.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll all see one other again (for the premiere) and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be hugging and kissing and remembering it fondly. But there were times when things were not quite so fond,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was in some ways used to it, but within a couple of weeks my wife (who was with him on set and used to be an actor) went, \u2018Some of these people are f------ mad.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s just a bunch of actors away on location, love. You\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like.\u2019\u201d",
      "The actor continued to spill just enough tea to keep fans interested. In a March interview with Vulture, Isaacs once again touched on the workplace dynamics.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a holiday. Some people got very close, there were friendships that were made and friendships that were lost. All the things you would imagine with a group of people unanchored from their home lives on the other side of the world, in the intense pressure cooker of the working environment with eye-melting heat and insects and late nights,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThey say in the show, \u2018What happens in Thailand stays in Thailand,\u2019 but there\u2019s an off-screen\u00a0\u2018White Lotus\u2019\u00a0as well, with fewer deaths but just as much drama,\u201d he added.",
      "When asked to elaborate on the drama he said, he would \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI became very close to some people and less close to others,\u201d was all he added. \u201cBut we still all had that experience together and there\u2019s a certain level of discretion required.\u201d",
      "Isaacs addressed the chatter his comments were generating head-on in an April 9 interview on SiriusXM\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Happy Hour.\"",
      "\u201cLike anywhere you go for the summer, there\u2019s friendships, there\u2019s romances, there\u2019s arguments, there\u2019s cliques that form and break and reform and stuff like that. I\u2019m careful,\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I look at the Internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd all these amateur Sherlock Holmes out there and nobody has the slightest clue what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople who think they\u2019re onto something, it then gets magnified ... I\u2019m talking about people you\u2019ve never met before half the time, in different departments and the people in the hair and costume and in the accounts department and stuff.\u201d",
      "He added that any drama \u201cit\u2019s none of your business,\u201d before acknowledging that being on set \u201cwasn\u2019t a holiday.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople think we were on a seven-month holiday, and believe me, it felt like work a lot of the time. It was insanely hot, and there\u2019s all the normal social tensions, you get anywhere,\u201d he continued, before sending a message to people. \u201cAnd for all of you who think you\u2019ve cracked it by something you think someone has posted, or who\u2019s in the photo or not ... you\u2019re just so far from the truth.\u201d",
      "Producer David Bernad hinted that actors took on their characters' personalities",
      "Producer Bernad reflected on workplace drama in the same The Guardian interview Isaacs first shared some set secrets.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s subconscious or conscious, people take on the persona of their character. Like any workplace, if you spend that much time together, people start to get annoyed with one other,\u201d Bernad said, also touching on the heat in real life and on the screen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s another aspect of the show that\u2019s unique. On normal productions, you work, then you go home to your family,\u201d he said. \u201cHere you work, and you go home to the same people.\u201d"

      "\u201c(Angel) had never watched them. The family had never seen them,\" Frye says, noting that the first time Carter Conrad watches the home video was captured for the documentary. \u201cShe had a great deal of trust with me.

      "What Frye discovered in the family footage, she says, was \u201cso heart-wrenching.\u201d The director saw how the parents dealt with their son's newfound fame and money, while other documentary subjects recalled the family's behind-the-scenes turmoil.",
      "\u201cFor myself, growing up in the business, I saw so many of my own friends\u2019 experiences,\u201d says Frye, who found fame at a young age starring in \u201cPunky Brewster.\u201d \u201cThe fact that there was so much attention on the young boys made it so that there was this sense of neglect that (Angel) and her siblings had.\u201d",
      "In the documentary, Carter Conrad describes herself and her sisters being neglected as children. Frye believes what \u201csaved\u201d Carter Conrad from going down a dark path was that she had friends whose homes she could go to.",

      "She told him how much she loved his sister and wanted to give them a safe space to share their story. \u201cAnd we shared a cupcake and the rest was history,\u201d she said.",
      "Viewers see Nick Carter and Carter Conrad backstage at one of his shows in Chicago. Frye, with her iPhone, is off to the side and records one of the first times that Nick Carter is seen speaking out on the death of his younger brother and their family.",
      "\u201cNick had never shared the process of losing his brother, and it was very clear to me in that moment that he was sharing with his sister, that that was really the first time that he was sharing about the loss of his brother,\u201d Frye tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cTo see those walls break down and the emotions ... I had been living in the archival where I had seen so much love between these brothers, and then to just watch those walls breaking down, it was devastating to witness.\u201d",

      "The conversation, she believed, was cathartic for the Backstreet Boy member.",
      "\u201cWe just sat down and it was just a real conversation. And I think that throughout this entire film, in order for it to work, it had to be authentic. It had to be the truth and unfortunately, the truth is ugly at times,\u201d Carter Conrad said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he saw that coming. I didn\u2019t think he knew that he was going to have that reaction.\u201d",
      "She added that she left the trip and thought to herself, \u201cOh my God, I think he had a breakthrough and he needed this. This was meant to happen for him, emotionally.\u201d",
      "Frye also recalled one of the last things Nick Carter saying in the room was, \u201cWow, I really must have had to get that out.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on her own child stardom and watching the Carter archival footage, Frye tells TODAY.com, \u201cHow many times can somebody break before it just explodes?\u201d",
      "Watching hours of Nick and Aaron Carter rehearsing as children, she said she also loved acting and performing \u2014 but when is it too much?",

      "\u201cThat was really important to me because I could see that there was just so much love despite all of the pain,\u201d Frye says."

      "\u201cEarlier today in a disagreement with Chris, your language and behaviour was threatening and aggressive. Big Brother does not tolerate threatening language or behaviour. In addition, you have used inappropriate sexual language to Ella.\u201d",

      "As the two largest economies in the world \u2014 the United States and China \u2014 continue to spar over tariffs, the escalating trade war is  spurring some Americans to favor Chinese goods in ways they never did before.",
      "President Donald Trump has said his sweeping tariffs around the globe are aimed at bringing manufacturing back to American shores. But as he continues to target China with his highest tariff yet, now at 145%, some Americans online say they are flocking to Chinese manufacturing rather than away from it.",
      "\u201cWhat do American companies think we\u2019re gonna do? We\u2019re gonna pay their prices rather than Chinese prices, when I can get a thousand times more product for the same price as we get here?\u201d a TikTok user said in a video that got more than 16.5 million views. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do that.\u201d",
      "Since Friday, videos on TikTok from Chinese manufacturers have drawn millions of views touting a wide variety of goods \u2014\u00a0including some making questionable claims about their roles in producing high-priced luxury items that say they\u2019re made in Europe. Others tout dupes, or replicas, of common brand-name items that they say are of the same or similar quality.",
      "The videos come as the United States imposes high tariffs on China and plans to close a trade loophole, called de minimis, that allows shipments under $800 to enter the country without taxes. Domestic and international discontent over Trump\u2019s trade policy has spilled over into the internet, where artificial intelligence videos that appear to show Americans working in factories and various other memes have flourished.",
      "Much of the content is surfacing on TikTok even as it faces an uncertain future in the United States. Having emerged as by far the most popular Chinese-owned social media app, it could be banned if its Beijing-based parent company doesn\u2019t divest ownership by June 15.",
      "Tony Wu, founder of the family business TLucky Sourcing, works behind the scenes with several popular Chinese factory sourcing accounts on TikTok. He said the accounts are using global social media platforms to advertise various Chinese suppliers to buyers, whether from the United States or elsewhere.",
      "The tariffs \u201cmake some troubles, for sure, but in two or three months it\u2019ll go back to normal, I think,\u201d said Wu, who connects with factories to find retail and individual buyers abroad. \u201cWe will find new buyers. And [Americans] cannot replace the China factory. Finally I think they will realize that they need to buy from China. ... There are no alternatives.\u201d",
      "Americans make up only around 5% of buyers for the factories he works with, he said, and those factories have much bigger export markets in South Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. So far, Wu said, American buyers aren\u2019t canceling orders but are instead opting for smaller orders or trying to negotiate prices.",
      "\u201cHonestly, America is not our main market. TikTok\u2019s just based in America \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean our customers are mainly from America,\u201d he said. He said that while he believes Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t be detrimental to Chinese exports, manufacturers are growing nervous about the sheer unpredictability of his trade policies.",
      "Many of the videos claimed the Chinese suppliers behind popular brands sell the same or similar pieces at much cheaper prices.",
      "\u201cThey sell you a legging pants for $100, and guess what? Here in these two factories, you can get them for around $5 to $6,\u201d @LunaSourcingChina, an account that works with Wu\u2019s sourcing business, said in a video that got more than 11 million views on TikTok. \u201cAnd what\u2019s even better, the material and the craftsmanship are basically the same because they all come from the same production line.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Lululemon, one of the brands mentioned in the video, said it \u201cdoes not work with the manufacturers identified in the online videos and we urge consumers to be aware of potentially counterfeit products and misinformation.\u201d",
      "Another TikTok account that gained traction this week, @senbags2, claimed his factory has been the original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, for most of the world\u2019s luxury bags for over 30 years. He claimed that by discreetly making bags in China before they are shipped to Europe for final touches, \u201cthe bags will appear at their boutiques as \u2018made in Italy\u2019 or \u2018made in France.\u2019\u201d",
      "In a video that caused heavy debate online, he claimed that a $38,000 Hermes Birkin handbag costs around $1,400 to make in a Chinese factory using the same high-quality materials. Hermes is well-known for crafting its Birkin bags exclusively in France, dedicating a single artisan to each bag.",
      "A spokesperson for Hermes didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Even as many online remained skeptical about the claims made in the trending warehouse videos, the discourse has raised questions about the true material value of Western name-brand goods.",
      "Chinese-made dupes of expensive luxury brands have been popular among American consumers for years \u2014 often sold by street vendors and on Chinese e-commerce sites like DHGate \u2014 but they\u2019ve long carried a stigma of being perceived as low-quality. What the recent videos from Chinese manufacturers purport, however, is that the knockoffs are equal in everything but the value of their names.",
      "As viral videos invited shoppers abroad to buy directly from the Chinese warehouses instead of paying top prices for Western brand logos, they generated a flurry of shock and glee among Americans who say they\u2019re looking to purchase cheaper wholesale goods that might save them enough money to offset Trump\u2019s tariffs on China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, some online have been pointing out that much of Trump\u2019s own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise is made in China, as well. Others have noted that for most things Americans consume \u2014 even, for example, a Florida tangerine \u2014\u00a0moving full production processes to the United States would be highly inefficient and expensive.",

Though his video made waves in China, a visit to the store by NBC News didn\u2019t find anything that appeared to be purposefully trying to obfuscate its origins.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should end his \u201cpolitical\u201d war in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home, former leaders of the Mossad intelligence agency and members of the military told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Unless Netanyahu changes \"his attitude and his strategy, I think that to achieve an agreement will be very difficult,\u201d Danny Yatom, who served as head of the Mossad, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.",
      "Yatom, who was also then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak\u2019s chief of staff and security adviser, is one several former leaders of the spy agency who backed a series of open letters to the Israeli government.",
      "The former members of the military and the intelligence community, as well as reservists, are demanding an end to the war in Gaza in return for the release of at least 59 hostages who remain in captivity there.",
      "Less than half are believed to still be alive, according to Israeli officials.",
      "After another letter signed by nearly\u00a01,000 Israeli Air Force reservists\u00a0and retirees was published in Israeli media on Thursday, the army said it would fire anyone who added their name to it. It did not specify how many people that included or if the firings had begun.",
      "Hamas has maintained that it will not agree to a deal that does not include the promise of a complete end to the war in Gaza, which began after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of a three-part ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 of Palestinian prisoners \u2014 ended on March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces shattered the fragile truce last month and has since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Yatom said it was clear to many that \u201cthe targets of Netanyahu are different than the targets of the society, of the Israeli society.\u201d",
      "\"His main priority is to remain prime minister,\" Yatom said, adding that his prime minister's fragile government coalition relies on the support of far-right lawmakers like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom have threatened to withdraw support if the military campaign ends in Gaza.",
      "Citing his opposition to the truce, Ben-Gvir resigned from the Israeli government in January after the original ceasefire deal was announced. He returned to the Cabinet shortly after Israeli forces resumed their operations in Gaza.",
      "Eran Duvdevani, a retired colonel with the Israel Defense Forces who helped to organize a separate letter signed by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers, said that Israel had agreed to the original ceasefire deal \"and now, it's as if there's zero willingness to agree to an end to the war.\"",
      "\u201cEven though Hamas did horrific things on Oct. 7, you don\u2019t go to war for revenge.\u201d he said.",

      "The Hamas terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people, and 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli counts, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 50,800 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 according to health officials in the Gaza Strip, and destroyed much of the enclave. More than 50 hostages remain in Gaza, both dead and alive.",
      "Efforts to renegotiate and resume the ceasefire have so far proved fruitless, with each side blaming the other."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping is turning on the charm as he looks to sweep up the shards of America\u2019s shattered economic relationships.",
      "As the world's markets and leaders try to absorb the impact of the market chaos unleashed by the Trump administration\u2019s announcement and softening of sweeping tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners, Xi embarked on a trip through Southeast Asia. After a visit to Vietnam, he landed in Malaysia on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cA trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere,\u201d he wrote in the Vietnamese newspaper Nhan Dan. \u201cOur two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and an open and cooperative international environment.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has interpreted Xi\u2019s words, as well as his Chinese counterpart\u2019s meetings with the leaders of the major economies in China\u2019s backyard, as Beijing getting together for a \u201clovely meeting\u201d with one of the countries worst hit by tariffs \u201cto figure out, \u2018how do we screw the United States of America?\u2019\u201d",
      "The message Xi is sending on his tour is loud and clear. China is seeking to capitalize on the Trump administration\u2019s truculence to cast itself as the world\u2019s preferred trading partner.",
      "That Xi\u2019s rare Southeast Asian tour started with Vietnam is no accident. Trump\u2019s punishing 46% tariff on the country will hammer the economy of a country that is the sixth largest source of U.S. imports and a third of whose gross domestic product relies on trade with the U.S.",
      "After Malaysia, which received a 24% levy from the U.S., Xi is expected to visit Cambodia \u2014 hit by 49% duties. He will do so after telling his Vietnamese counterpart, To Lam, that Beijing and Hanoi must \u201cjointly oppose unilateral bullying and safeguard the global free trade system,\u201d according to China\u2019s state-run broadcaster CCTV News.",
      "Xi\u2019s trip, his first overseas foray in over a year, is just the beginning of a broader response to Trumponomics, analysts say.",
      "The Chinese leader \u201chappily sees Donald Trump destroying, undermining, discrediting, deliberate international order in order to make it easier for him to push for the transformation of the international order into something \u2018better,\u2019\u201d says Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies) University of London.",
      "Winning over Southeast Asia, with its developing economies already largely dependent on Beijing, will be the easy part.",
      "Slightly more difficult for Xi will be supplanting the U.S. as the biggest trading partner of the European Union.",
      "Last week, Xi told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez that the bloc should join forces with China to oppose \u201cunilateral bullying\u201d and defend the \u201cinternational rules and order\u201d \u2014 words almost identical to ones he used this week in Hanoi.",
      "While Beijing followed that up Monday with a statement emphasizing Sino-European unity, Washington has made things easy for Xi, says Wang Dong, executive director of Peking University\u2019s Institute for Global Cooperation.",
      "\u201cChina doesn\u2019t have to \u201cdrive a wedge\u201d between the U.S. and its allies,\u201d Wang told NBC News. \u201cRather, the bullying and cruel manner the Trump administration rolled out the punitive tariffs, along with the unpredictability and selfishness manifested by the U.S., have already driven US allies and partners closer to Beijing.\u201d",
      "A thaw in relations has already begun. E.U. leaders last week agreed to revive negotiations on the prices of electric vehicles \u2014 they imposed a 45% tariff on low-emission Chinese cars in October \u2014 despite fears that Chinese products may flood the European market if the U.S. keeps in place its 145% levy on Chinese imports.",
      "But that softening comes amid a raft of economic disputes between the world\u2019s second- and third-largest economies. It may also be difficult to achieve more due to China\u2019s one-party rule and\u00a0concerns over human rights allegations.",
      "\u201cLots of people don\u2019t share China\u2019s political values,\u201d said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King\u2019s College London.",
      "More difficult still will be warming up long-standing U.S. allies in Asia \u2014 specifically Japan and South Korea \u2014 whose economies will suffer the effects of 24% and 25% tariffs respectively, despite them scrambling teams of trade envoys within days of the tariff announcements.",
      "The U.S. is both countries\u2019 main guarantor against security threats from China and Russia, and Tokyo's and Seoul\u2019s reactions are best summed up by the South Korean Foreign Ministry\u2019s comment Monday that \u201cbilateral dialogue with the United States is the most effective way to resolve the issue of U.S. tariff measures.\u201d",
      "But with China both countries\u2019 largest trading partner and Washington's increasingly spotty loyalty mean South Korea and Japan\u00a0are essentially \u201ccaught in a quandary,\u201d Brown said. \u201cChina is still practically a power you have to deal with.\u201d",
      "And if the carrot doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s always the stick. Beijing holds at least one key piece of leverage over Washington and its allies.",
      "China held more than $700 billion in U.S. government bonds \u2014 the proceeds from which the U.S. Treasury finances public expenditure \u2014 making it among the largest holders of such bonds.",
      "If China sells those bonds, it will threaten America\u2019s ability to finance its debt, Brown said.",
      "Between that, and Beijing wearing the reassuring face of a reliable trading partner, \u201cChina\u2019s got itself into a relatively good position,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it annoys the hell out of America.\u201d"

      "But Khamenei has been forced to engage with Washington in search of a nuclear deal due to fears that public anger at home over economic hardship could erupt into mass protests and endanger the existence of the clerical establishment, four Iranian officials told Reuters in March.",
      "Tehran\u2019s concerns were exacerbated by Trump\u2019s speedy revival of his\u00a0\u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign\u00a0when he returned to the White House in January.",
      "During his first term, Trump ditched Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic.",
      "Since 2019, Iran has far surpassed the 2015 deal\u2019s limits on uranium enrichment, producing stocks at a high level of fissile purity, well above what Western powers say is justifiable for a civilian energy program and close to that required for nuclear warheads.",

      "Russia and Belarus are ready to act pre-emptively over increased military escalation by European countries over Ukraine, the head of Russia's foreign spy service said Tuesday, according to state media.",
      "\u201cWe feel and see that European countries, especially France, Great Britain and Germany, are increasing the level of escalation around the Ukrainian conflict. Therefore, we need to act preemptively. We are ready for this,\u201d Sergei Naryshkin was quoted as saying by both the Tass and RIA news agencies.",
      "In the event of an attack on Russia or Belarus, Russia would retaliate against NATO as a whole, but Poland and the Baltic states would suffer first, he added.",
      "Those countries should understand that \u201cin the event of aggression\u201d from NATO, \u201cdamage will certainly be inflicted on the entire NATO bloc, but to a greater extent the first to suffer will be the bearers of such ideas in the political circles of Poland and the Baltic countries,\u201d Naryshkin said.",
      "He spoke hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it \u201cnot easy\u201d to agree with the United States on key parts of a possible peace deal with Ukraine. \u201cWe are well aware of what a mutually beneficial deal looks like, which we have never rejected, and what a deal looks like that could lead us into another trap,\u201d he told Russia's Kommersant newspaper.",
      "His comments appeared to pour cold water on the optimism expressed by Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy leading talks with the Kremlin, after he met with President Vladimir Putin in the Russian city of St. Petersburg on Friday to discuss a ceasefire in the war, which entered its fourth year in February.",
      "Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that a peace deal was \u201cemerging\u201d and that he thought \u201cwe might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large.\u201d",
      "The same day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also warned that Putin could try to seize NATO territory if he is not stopped in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cIf we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an interview with CBS News, adding that Putin's long-term objectives included restoring the Russian empire, which would include parts of NATO-allied countries. \u201cConsidering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war,\u201d he said.",
      "Ukraine held a news conference with Chinese soldiers captured on the front lines on Monday. Handcuffed and flanked by armed and masked Ukrainian soldiers, they told reporters that they had been lured to fight in the war by bloggers on TikTok and Chinese social media.",

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary\u2019s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.",
      "The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Ahead of the vote \u2014 the final step for the amendment \u2014 opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.",
      "The amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "D\u00e1vid Bed\u0151, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz for the past 15 years \u201chave been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.\u201d",
      "He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, \u201cthey will do everything in their power to stay in power.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.",
      "Hungary\u2019s government has campaigned against LGBTQ communities in recent years, and argues its \u201cchild protection\u201d policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls \u201cwoke ideology\u201d and \u201cgender madness.\u201d",
      "Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing base ahead of elections.",
      "\u201cThis whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children\u2019s rights,\u201d said D\u00e1nel D\u00f6brentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it \u201cpure propaganda.\u201d",
      "Constitution recognizes two sexes",
      "The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs wrote that the change is \u201cnot an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d",
      "D\u00f6brentey, the lawyer, said it was \u201ca clear message\u201d for transgender and intersex people: \u201cIt is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.\u201d",
      "The amendment is the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.",
      "Facial recognition to identify demonstrators",
      "\u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.",
      "\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.",
      "\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.",
      "Suspension of citizenship",
      "The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d"

      "In a statement Monday, the State Department said it is aware of the situation and is providing the citizens with consular assistance.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that the citizens' safety is a priority but that no further comment would be given out of respect for their privacy.",
      "Owen Ray\u2019s parents identified him as one of the people arrested in Copenhagen in March, saying in a statement Monday that their son and a friend \"were the victims of an unprovoked verbal and physical assault by an Uber driver.\"",
      "\u201cThey did nothing to instigate the attack,\" Andy Ray and Sara Buchen-Ray said in the statement.",
      "A spokesperson for Uber said it takes \"reports of violence very seriously.\"",
      "\"The driver reported to Uber that he was assaulted by two riders who were later arrested by Danish police,\" the spokesperson said in a statement that directed additional questions to police.",
      "On the night of March 31, Ray and a friend ordered an Uber ride to their hotel before they realized they had put in the wrong address, Erin Pelon, a representative for Ray, said Monday. Ray's friend did not wish to be named, Pelon said.",
      "\"Once in the car, they realized they had inadvertently selected the wrong hotel and were unable to change the location in the Uber app,\" Pelon said. \"The driver declined to take them to the alternate location, so Owen and his friend exited the Uber and they canceled the ride.\"",
      "Minutes later, the driver came back and began yelling, demanding to be paid, Pelon said. Ray and his friend told the driver that he would get paid through the app, and that's when the driver exited the car and threatened them, Pelon said. Ray and his friend urged the driver to \"call the police because they\u2019d done nothing wrong,\" Pelon said.",
      "\"The Uber driver then assaulted Owen,\" Pelon said. \"A scuffle ensued, culminating in the boys fleeing due to fear. This is all captured via the Uber\u2019s dash cam video, which is now part of the legal proceedings in Denmark.\"",
      "Ray was detained at the gate when he was about to board a flight.",
      "Copenhagen police said in a statement that the citizens were arrested on the same day and taken in front of a court, where they were charged with common assault.",
      "\"They were sentenced to 10 days pre-trial detention,\" police said. \"This verdict has since extended until April 24.\"",
      "Ray was released from Vestre Prison on Tuesday, Pelon said. In a statement, Ray's parents said they were relieved about his release but were \"deeply concerned that Danish authorities have confiscated his passport and will not allow him to return to the United States.\"",
      "\"The facts make clear that Owen is the victim in this case, and we urge Danish officials to allow him to return home to the United States without delay,\" they said.",
      "If they are convicted, the citizens can be fined or imprisoned for up to three years, according to Section 244 of the Danish Criminal Code."
