      "Australian senators have voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month",
      "CANBERRA, Australia -- Australian senators on Monday voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month.",
      "The censure of independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe is a symbolic gesture that records her colleagues\u2019 disapproval of her conduct during the first visit to Australia by a British monarch in 13 years.",
      "The motion was carried 46 votes to 12.",
      "Government leader in the Senate Penny Wong said Thorpe\u2019s outburst sought to \u201cincite outrage and grievance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is part of a trend that we do see internationally which, quite frankly, we do not need here in Australia,\u201d Wong told the Senate.",
      "Thorpe launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles following his speech during his visit to Canberra and Sydney.",
      "\u201cYou are not our king. You are not sovereign,\u201d Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception.",
      "\u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\u201d she added.",
      "Following her censure, Thorpe said she would repeat her rant if Charles returned.",
      "\u201cIf the colonizing king were to come to my country again, our country, then I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Thorpe told reporters.",
      "\u201cAnd I will keep doing it. I will resist colonization in this country. I swear my allegiance to the real sovereigns of these lands; First Peoples are the real sovereigns. You don\u2019t have some random king rock up and say he\u2019s sovereign,\u201d she added.",
      "Sen. Mehreen Faruqi, a member of the minor Greens party, opposed the censure motion.",
      "\u201cThe bubble of white privilege that encapsulates this parliament is a systemic issue,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here today, debating a Black senator being censured for telling the truth of the British crown\u2019s genocide on First Nations people and telling it the way she wants to.\"",
      "The vote took place before Thorpe arrived on a flight from Melbourne. Thorpe said she had wanted to be in Parliament for the vote but government senators refused to wait.",
      "Indigenous people account for fewer than 4% of Australia's population and are the nation's most disadvantaged ethnic group."

      "Many of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars have gathered at the annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles to honor the late Quincy Jones, James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The family of Quincy Jones was not sure they wanted to attend the Governors Awards.",
      "Their father died two weeks before he could accept his second honorary Oscar, alongside Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, filmmaker Richard Curtis and casting director Juliet Taylor.",
      "But the Jones family decided to show up for the event Sunday night in Hollywood for a celebration of his life and work with humor from Jamie Foxx, a rousing performance by Jennifer Hudson and a moment with his family: His daughter Rashida Jones even read the speech he had been working on up until a month ago.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we wanted to celebrate his beautiful life and career,\u201d she said. \u201cHis music has literally defined an entire century of culture spanning genres.\u201d",
      "It was a moving end to a celebratory evening that had Hugh Grant roasting Curtis for getting a \u201ckind of Oscar\u201d and Daniel Craig celebrating the legacy of the James Bond films.",
      "The audience in the Ray Dolby Ballroom was starrier than even the Oscars. The event, put on by the film academy\u2019s board of governors, is also a de-facto campaign stop for Oscar hopefuls as awards season gets underway.",
      "Everywhere you looked there were famous faces greeting one another: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson at the bar ordering a margarita on the rocks; Jude Law and Kristen Wiig exchanging hellos; Zooey Deschanel sipping champagne; Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham wandering around; Saoirse Ronan and Elizabeth Olsen deep in conversation; Sharon Stone hugging Kieran Culkin; Jesse Eisenberg chatting with Elle Fanning; and Jeremy Strong taking a selfie with Guy Pearce.",
      "Others remained near their seats, like Jennifer Lawrence, June Squibb and Angelina Jolie, who attended alongside her son Knox Jolie-Pitt. They sat beside her \u201cMaria\u201d director Pablo Larra\u00edn and across from \u201cHis Three Daughters\u201d stars Natasha Lyonne and Olson. At another table, Barry Keoghan kept making his way to Margarat Qualley\u2019s side, squeezing in between her and Demi Moore.",
      "But most of the schmoozing subsided for the main event. With no television cameras or band to play anyone off during a speech, it is a night during which friends and colleagues can pay tribute to the year\u2019s honorary Oscar recipients.",
      "Broccoli and her brother Wilson followed in her father\u2019s footsteps receiving the rarely given Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, celebrating the work of producers. Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli accepted his own trophy, then a bust of Thalberg, at the 1982 Academy Awards as they looked on from the audience.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heavier than I thought,\u201d Wilson said, holding the Oscar statuette.",
      "Broccoli also commented on the importance of producers, a credit she said that lately is being handed out like party favors.",
      "They got some gentle ribbing from Craig beforehand. Broccoli, he said, \u201ccackles, I mean, crackles with passion.\u201d But for a man who has always had a seemingly conflicted relationship with his Bond era, his admiration for them was evident.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I admire your integrity,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThese (Bond movies) are the most expensive independent films ever made.\u201d",
      "Grant was less delicate but infinitely funnier paying tribute to Curtis, who has written for and directed him in many films including \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cLove, Actually.\u201d",
      "\u201cWould we call it an Oscar? It\u2019s a kind of Oscar,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt\u2019s a better than nothing Oscar.\u201d",
      "Curtis may be best known for his contributions to romantic comedies, but the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was for a lifetime of charitable work, which Grant said was \u201cannoying and frankly selfish.\u201d In his acceptance speech, Curtis made a plea to the room to set aside a small portion of film budgets to hire an impact producer.",
      "Nicole Kidman presented the honorary Oscar to Taylor, a casting director unaccustomed to being publicly celebrated for her contributions to cinema. In her career of more than four decades, she cast classics like \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cWorking Girl,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d Squibb, at the event with her \u201cThelma\u201d director Josh Margolin, said that Taylor cast her in her fist film, Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cAlice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have a career in motion pictures without it,\u201d Squibb said.",
      "While Taylor was excited about her award, she was even happier that her peers are soon going to be regularly recognized. Starting with films released in 2025, the film academy will give a new competitive Oscar to casting directors.",
      "There were many somber references throughout the evening to the events of the \u201clast few weeks,\u201d although no one speaking from the stage said anything much more specific. Jamie Foxx, introducing the Quincy Jones tribute, did his own little impersonation of President Elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhy is everyone so down on these few weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "Foxx quickly got back on track to speak about Jones, whose celebration closed out the evening on a cathartic note.",
      "\u201cHe was really excited to attend tonight,\u201d Rashida Jones said. \u201cHe has so many friends in this room. Well, actually, probably in every room to be honest because wherever he went he made connections with everyone. Real ones. He knew how to stay present, to stay curious, to stay loving.\"",
      "Jones invited the audience to listen on the way home, to go for the deepest cuts.",
      "\u201cThere's an entire universe waiting in his seven decades of music,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while you listen, hear him, hear how he imbued love into every single second of music he made. That was his real legacy: Love.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Walk into any supermarket and you can usually buy a banana for less than $1",
      "NEW YORK -- Walk into any supermarket and you can generally buy a banana for less than $1. But a banana duct-taped to a wall? That might sell for more than $1 million at an upcoming auction at Sotheby\u2019s in New York.",
      "The yellow banana fixed to the white wall with silver duct tape is a work entitled \u201cComedian,\u201d by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It first debuted in 2019 as an edition of three fruits at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair, where it became a much-discussed sensation.",
      "Was it a prank? A commentary on the state of the art world? Another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. A backup banana was brought in. Selfie-seeking crowds became so thick, \u201cComedian\u201d was withdrawn from view, but three editions of it sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to Perrotin gallery.",
      "Now, the conceptual artwork has an estimated value of between $1 million and $1.5 million at Sotheby's auction on Nov. 20. Sotheby's head of contemporary art, David Galperin, calls it profound and provocative.",
      "\u201cWhat Cattelan is really doing is turning a mirror to the contemporary art world and asking questions, provoking thought about how we ascribe value to artworks, what we define as an artwork,\" Galperin said.",
      "Bidders won't be buying the same fruit that was on display in Miami. Those bananas are long gone. Sotheby\u2019s says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape.",
      "\u201cWhat you buy when you buy Cattelan\u2019s \u2018Comedian\u2019 is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,\u201d Galperin said.",
      "The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chlo\u00e9 Cooper Jones, an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context.",
      "Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where \u201cComedian\u201d was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said.",
      "If \u201cComedian\u201d is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, \u201cit\u2019s not that interesting of an idea.\u201d",
      "But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people.",
      "Cattelan is often thought of a \u201ctrickster artist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He\u2019s quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves.\u201d",
      "And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana,\u201d Cooper Jones said. If \u201cComedian\u201d is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's \u201cat least a more useful tool or it\u2019s at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cComedian\u201d hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the \u201cWater Lilies\u201d series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million.",
      "When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's \u201cNymph\u00e9as,\" Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began.",
      "\u201cNo important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,\u201d Galperin said.",

      "LONDON -- A gold pocket watch given to the ship captain who rescued 700 survivors from the Titanic sold at auction for nearly $2 million, setting a record for memorabilia from the ship wreck.",
      "The 18-carat Tiffany & Co. watch was given by three women survivors to Capt. Arthur Rostron for diverting his passenger ship, the RMS Carpathia, to save them and others after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in the north Atlantic on its maiden voyage in 1912.",
      "Auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, who sold the watch to a private collector in the United States on Saturday for 1.56 million British pounds, said it\u2019s the most paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia. The price includes taxes and fees paid by the buyer.",
      "The watch was given to Rostron by the widow of John Jacob Astor, the richest man to die in the disaster, and the widows of two other wealthy businessmen who went down with the ship.",
      "Astor's pocket watch, which was on his body when it was recovered seven days after the ship sank, had previously set the record for the highest price paid for a Titanic keepsake, fetching nearly $1.5 million (1.17 million pounds) from the same auction house in April.",
      "Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said the fact that Titanic memorabilia has set two records this year demonstrates the enduring fascination with the story and the value of the dwindling supply and high demand for ship artifacts.",
      "\u201cEvery man, woman and child had a story to tell, and those stories are told over a century later through the memorabilia,\" he said.",
      "Rostron was hailed a hero for his actions the night the Titanic sank and his crew was recognized for their bravery.",
      "The Carpathia was sailing from New York to the Mediterranean Sea when a radio operator heard a distress call from the Titanic in the early hours of April 15, 1912 and woke Rostron in his cabin. He turned his boat around and headed at full steam toward the doomed vessel, navigating through ice bergs to get there.",
      "By the time the Carpathia arrived, the Titanic had sunk and 1,500 people perished. But the crew located 20 lifeboats and rescued more than 700 passengers and took them back to New York.",
      "Rostron was awarded the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal by President William Howard Taft and was later knighted by King George V.",
      "Madeleine Astor, who had been helped into a lifeboat by her husband, presented the watch to Rostron at a luncheon at her mansion on Fifth Avenue in New York.",
      "The inscription says it was given \u201cwith the heartfelt gratitude and appreciation of three survivors.\u201d It lists Mrs. John B. Thayer and Mrs. George D. Widener alongside Astor's married name.",
      "\u201cIt was presented principally in gratitude for Rostron\u2019s bravery in saving those lives,\u201d Aldridge said. \"Without Mr. Rostron, those 700 people wouldn\u2019t have made it.\u201d"

      "The first major studio holiday release since 2018, \u201cRed One\u201d opened on 4,032 screens, including IMAX and other large formats, on an otherwise quiet weekend for major releases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really happy with the results,\" Wilson said. \u201cI think when you look at the theatrical marketplace that's sometimes unforgiving, especially for original films, this is a good result for us.\u201d",
      "Since 2020, only seven films that weren't sequels or based on another piece of intellectual property have opened over $30 million (including \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cNope.\u201d)",
      "Warner Bros. is handling the overseas release, where it has made an estimated $50 million in two weekends from 75 territories and 14,783 screens.",
      "Still, it\u2019s certainly not a theatrical hit in North America. Even \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d made slightly more in its first weekend. \u201cRed One,\u201d directed by Jake Kasdan and produced by Johnson\u2019s Seven Bucks, was roundly rejected by critics, with a dismal 33% Rotten Tomatoes score. Jake Coyle, in his review for The Associated Press, wrote that it \u201cfeels like an unwanted high-priced Christmas present.\u201d",
      "Audiences were kinder than they were to \u201cJoker 2,\u201d giving it an A- CinemaScore, suggesting, perhaps, that the idea of it becoming a perennial holiday favorite is not so off-base.",
      "\u201cRed One\u201d is also overperforming in the middle of the country, Wilson said, and perhaps will have a nice holdover over Thanksgiving as a different option to the behemoths on the way.",
      "Sony's \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d added $7.4 million this weekend's box office to take second place, bringing its domestic total to $127.6 million. Globally, its total stands at $436.1 million.",
      "Lionsgate's \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d landed in third with $5.4 million. That much more modestly budgeted Christmas movie has already nearly doubled its $10 million production budget in two weeks. Fourth place went to A24\u2019s Hugh Grant horror \u201cHeretic,\u201d with $5.2 million, bumping its total gross to $20.4 million.",
      "Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d rounded out the top five in its eighth weekend in theaters with an additional $4.3 million. The animated film surpassed $300 million worldwide.",

      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d also got a bit of a head start internationally, where it opened in 63 markets this weekend to gross $87 million. That's a record for filmmaker Ridley Scott and for an R-rated international release from Paramount. It opens in the U.S. and Canada on Nov. 22.",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the \u201cRed One\u201d is helping set into motion a momentum leading into the Thanksgiving corridor.",

      "Retired Sydney radio broadcaster and former Australian national rugby coach Alan Jones has been charged with multiple sex crimes against males over two decades",
      "SYDNEY -- Retired Sydney radio broadcaster and former Australian national rugby coach Alan Jones was charged Monday with multiple sex crimes against males over two decades, police said.",
      "The 83-year-old will appear in a Sydney court on Dec. 18 on 24 charges relating to eight alleged victims from 2001 to 2019, Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Fitzgerald said.",
      "Fitzgerald said the youngest of the alleged victims was 17 when the first offense allegedly occurred.",
      "\u201cIn regards to the victims, we will allege that the accused knew some of them personally, some of them professionally. And we\u2019ll also allege that some of the victims when the alleged offense took place, was the first time that they ever met the accused,\u201d Fitzgerald told reporters.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer Bryan Wrench did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jones was arrested Monday morning at his Sydney waterfront apartment and made no comment to media when he left a police station late Monday.",
      "Jones hosted a popular Sydney breakfast radio from 2002 until he retired in 2020. He was regarded as one of the most powerful people in Australian media.",
      "He was also a successful coach of the Australian national rugby team, the Wallabies, for four years from early 1984. The team won 86 of their 102 matches under his leadership.",
      "Jones was also influential in conservative politics and was a speechwriter for Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Fraser was in power from 1975 until 1983. Fraser died in 2015.",
      "Police set up a strike force to investigate Jones after The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported in December last year allegations that Jones used his position of power, first as a school teacher and later as a popular broadcaster, to prey on a number of young men.",
      "The charges include 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault and nine counts of assault with an act of indecency. There were also two charges of sexual touching and two charges of common assault."

      "Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China",
      "WASHINGTON -- Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It\u2019s in Washington\u2019s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago.",
      "\u201cThere is no pressure from the authorities here,\u201d said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington\u2019s only Chinese bookseller. \u201cI want to live without fear.\u201d",
      "Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world\u2019s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago.",
      "The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China\u2019s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication.",
      "The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores.",
      "Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad.",
      "It\u2019s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities.",
      "The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China\u2019s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear.",
      "An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn\u2019t respond to an interview request.",
      "Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control.",
      "\u201cThe government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,\u201d Berry said.",
      "These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications.",
      "Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn\u2019t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller.",
      "Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang\u2019s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore\u2019s window read: \u201cTemporarily closed\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re promoting culture, I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, right? I\u2019m just selling some books and promoting culture,\u201d Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string.",
      "\u201cThen why won\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d Wang added.",
      "Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed.",
      "Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities.",
      "Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for \u201cprinting, copying or selling illegal publications,\u201d according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not \u201cregister the copy content as required\u201d and demanded they fix the problem quickly.",
      "In Shaoyang, a city in China\u2019s south, authorities said they will be \u201ccracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened \u2014 often for unclear reasons \u2014 or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020.",
      "Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry.",
      "\u201cEveryone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,\u201d Liu says, despite the challenges.",
      "In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally.",
      "Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThey want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format \u2014 a gallery, or a restaurant.\u201d",
      "Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like \u201canother world in a bubble\u201d which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages.",
      "\u201cIt also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,\u201d Li added.",
      "The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind.",
      "Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be.",
      "He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling \u201cillegal publications.\u201d All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities.",
      "Zhou said he could not handle further harassment He said it was as if he were \u201csmuggling drugs instead of selling books.\u201d",
      "The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was \u201ca rebellion and a resistance,\u201d which is not there anymore. ___",

      "\u201cPlaya Saturno,\u201d the 2023 surprise spinoff to his 2022 record \u201cSaturno,\u201d brought his R&B-informed reggaeton to new heights on an extraterrestrial concept album. A year later, and he's completely shifted gears, finding inspiration in classic sounds and imagery, pulling from a '60s and '70s Nuyorican cool \u2014 while still doing what he\u2019s always done best: contorting familiar genres into something novel.",
      "Alejandro is releasing his fifth studio album \u201cCosa Nuestra,\u201d a title borrowed from Willie Col\u00f3n and H\u00e9ctor Lavoe's 1969 album, on Friday. (There's a sample of Col\u00f3n and Lavoe's \u201cQu\u00e9 L\u00edo\u201d in the opening title track.) It marries classic Puerto Rican instruments and genres, like salsa and merengue, with more modern sounds like reggaeton. And it is amplified by a number of inventive samples \u2014 like Frankie Ruiz's \u201cT\u00fa Con \u00c9l\u201d \u2014 and all-star collaborators: Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Feid among them.",
      "Alejandro's created a kind of character for the release, whom he calls \u201cRa\u00fal Alejandro,\u201d a nod to his father and the early migration of Puerto Ricans to New York, which he explored in an interview conducted in Spanish and English ahead of the 2024 Latin Grammys. It has been translated and edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm really happy. I think it's a different stage of my career. More elevated as a music producer, writer, artist in general. I've also grown a lot as a person. I feel more mature in every part of my life. This feels like the whole experience of my career in one whole project.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Puerto Rico is in every part of the books, in history. We're in every part of the world. You mentioned hip-hop, Puerto Ricans were involved in that as well. But before that, you see a salsa world \u2014 the Fania All-Stars. New York in the '70s was a lot of jazz, soul. It's just a lot of music from New York and Puerto Ricans have always been there. Reggaeton comes from Carolina, Puerto Rico. It's the birthplace. It's special. I feel really proud to be a Puerto Rican.",
      "In this new era, I went to New York and found great inspiration for my music but kept my essence. I keep the island at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm thinking about what it means to be Puerto Rican, our culture.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Of course, definitely. Salsa was a world that I had yet to explore. When I'm doing new projects, I try to look back at what I've accomplished and what I have yet to do. I try to analyze my whole career and see what's going to be next with Rauw, what's going to be new; I take my time at the studio, at home, studying, analyzing.",
      "This project has a lot of salsa influence, a lot of African influence. I'm using the live instruments (for) the first time. Instruments traditional to Puerto Rico like the cuatro, puertorrique\u00f1o guitar, maraca, el guiro, la conga, all mixed with the digital sounds. And, you know, it sounds fresh. It sounds rich and perfect for dancing.",
      "ALEJANDRO: We started working in New York and we finished in Paris. We have a few other records at the studio, but \u201cCommitted,\u201d this song is really special. He was the one that wrote that, the hook. And he was like, \u201cRauw, you have to sing it in English.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI've never done this before. It's new.\u201d It was challenge for me, you know, singing a whole hook in English. I told him, \u201cOK, but I\u2019ll do the verse in Spanish.\u201d I like to write my own verses and wanted to make it my own. We fused our ideas together.",
      "He understood the whole concept of the project. He's a legend, a mentor. You're going to hear more music from Pharrell and Rauw.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I always liked the classic stuff, and being really elegant, since I was a kid. I always like to be in a suit and tie. I found excuses to be really dressed up. And I think this character borrows that from Rauw Alejandro. I'm 31. I feel like a young spirt with an old soul, living in New York, the city's vibes, the musical influence of the '60s, the long coats ... the swag of Puerto Rico. I can't deny it. I think the way that you dress is the way you express yourself and your art.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm from Puerto Rico, that's my island. As a civilian, I'm always going to fight for my rights and give my opinion, share a positive message, be an example for the next generation and try to find the best solutions for my island. I think Benito (Bad Bunny) and Rene (Residente) have always done the same. I think everyone expresses themselves in different ways, but as an artist, the people can always count on me to share a message.",

      "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson aren\u2019t the only ones who have high stakes when they meet in the boxing ring on Friday night",
      "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson aren't the only ones who have high stakes when they meet in the boxing ring on Friday night.",
      "For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon.",
      "The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost.",
      "Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight.",
      "JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion.",
      "The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though.",
      "\u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d",
      "Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows.",
      "Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year.",
      "The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally.",
      "Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events.",
      "Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas, including its premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "\u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d",

      "\u201cLiverpool, it\u2019s the capital of country music in England,\u201d Starr said, \u201cbecause a lot of I think it stems from it being a port, and why we got rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music physically, was because the lads on the boats would be going to America, they\u2019d be going to Egypt, would be going all over. But they were bringing music in.\u201d",
      "Starr \u2014 even his stage name has cowboy vibes \u2014 had a star turn with the Beatles in 1965 when he sang the Buck Owens' honky-tonk classic, \u201cAct Naturally.\" Many of the Beatle originals the drummer sang, including \u201cWhat Goes On\u201d and \u201cDon't Pass Me By,\" had country undertones.",

      "Starr had been doing a series of EPs with different writers and producers, including a recent release with Linda Perry, and suggested Burnett give him a song for the next one.",

      "Starr played the drums and sang in Los Angeles, while Burnett recorded parts of the record in Nashville, bringing on young neo-classical country artists Billy Strings and Molly Tuttle for several tracks apiece.",
      "And Krauss sings with Starr on the song he co-wrote, \u201cThankful,\u201d released Friday as the album's second single, in which he managed to smuggle his catchphrase, \u201cpeace and love,\u201d into a genre that's usually about anything but.",
      "\u201cYeah, I put it in the song,\u201d he said with a smile.",

She gave many stars their big breaks. But Streep, she said, was always going to happen \u2014 the young stage actor was the talk of the town in New York as soon as she came on the scene. Taylor was simply the lucky one who happened to be casting for \u201cJulia,\u201d which didn\u2019t conflict with a play.",
      "Modesty is not antithetical to being a great casting director, though, a profession of observation, negotiation and nuance that operates mostly out of the public eye. It\u2019s why Taylor's a little nervous about Sunday, when she\u2019ll be presented with an honorary Oscar at the film academy\u2019s annual Governors Awards in a room full of Hollywood greats.",
      "Recognition is long overdue for Taylor and her peers. Earlier this year, the film academy announced that it would add a new competitive Oscar for casting directors starting with films released in 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much people don\u2019t know about casting actors,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOne thing is we negotiate all the contracts and we cast a movie within a budget.\u201d",
      "Casting wasn\u2019t always the art that it is today. In the studio system, it was more of cattle call, an organizational rather than creative job. But Taylor began her career in 1968 at time of change, mentored by one of the pioneers behind the movement: Marion Dougherty, who scouted talent in off-Broadway plays and turned casting into a more selective, humane process. It was also a profession led by a lot of women. Dougherty used to joke that it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t get paid much.",
      "The first movie Taylor led casting on was \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a baptism by fire in many ways. Director William Friedkin had not gotten along with Dougherty on \u201cThe Night They Raided Minsky\u2019s\" and called the office with a strange request.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I hear you have a really good assistant. Would you let her cast my movie?\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did that as something that was not nice to do. That was terrifying for me. I was scared to death the entire time.\u201d",
      "But she also found her voice on the film, discovering Linda Blair and taking a shot on Jason Miller, a playwright who she had a good feeling about.",
      "\u201cHe had such a great face and he was such an interesting kind of brooding man,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll come in and cry.\u2019 He did and he got the part. That was exciting. That\u2019s a casting director\u2019s dream.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo many of them turned out so well because I worked for such wonderful directors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m being falsely modest, but I do feel like so many of these people were just so talented you couldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d",
      "Some of her proudest moments were finding real people to fill out movies, like the lounge singer in \u201cBroadway Danny Rose.\u201d There are also the actors who she didn\u2019t give up on.",
      "\u201cI used to drag poor Jeff Daniels in for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then also there were two different communities of actors and there was very little intermingling.

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- A stolen portrait of Winston Churchill that was swapped with a forgery during the pandemic has returned to its rightful place, after two Ottawa police detectives traveled to Rome to retrieve it.",
      "Police said \u201dThe Roaring Lion\" was stolen from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa, sometime between Christmas Day 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, and replaced with a forgery. The swap was only uncovered months later, in August, when a hotel worker noticed the frame wasn't hung properly and looked different than the others.",
      "Genevieve Dumas, the hotel\u2019s general manager, unveiled the portrait in a ceremony on Friday.",
      "\u201cI can tell you that it is armed, locked, secured,\u201d Dumas said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not moving,\u201d she said, adding that staff accidentally triggered the alarm on Thursday, while they hung it up, \u201cand I\u2019m sure they heard it on Parliament Hill.\u201d",
      "The most famous depiction of Churchill, known as \u201cThe Roaring Lion,\u201d appears on the U.K.\u2019s five-pound banknote and shows a glowering wartime prime minister staring into the camera.",
      "Renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh snapped the iconic portrait in 1941 in the Speaker\u2019s office just after Churchill delivered a rousing wartime address to Canadian lawmakers.",
      "Toward the end of his life, Karsh signed and gifted the portrait to the hotel, where he had lived and worked.",
      "The portrait had been sold through an auction house in London to a private buyer, and both seller and buyer were unaware that it had been stolen, police said.",
      "Police have now charged a man from the town of Powassan, Ontario, with forgery, theft and trafficking. That case is before the courts.",
      "The portrait\u2019s return was a widely anticipated event, with a ceremony held in a room packed with attendees including Ottawa's mayor.",
      "Nicola Cassinelli, a lawyer in Genoa who bought the stolen artwork, sent a message.",
      "\u201cThe magnificent photograph by Yousuf Karsh captures in the eyes of Sir Winston Churchill the pride, the anger and the strength of the free world. And it represents, better than any other, the desire for the triumph of good over evil.\u201d",

      "Across 10-tracks, the powerhouse singer leans into the mellow rock of her youth \u2014 think Hall & Oates, Chicago, Fleetwood Mac \u2014 with dashes of country vibes here and there. Her voice is ageless, unaltered and distinctive, immediately recalling the early aughts when No Doubt still existed, and Stefani was still a bit of a ska girl.",
      "Thematically, however, the songs are about a woman who\u2019s been through the ringer \u2014 but life gave her a reprieve in her second act, and she found stability, lots of flowers and no mo\u2019 drama. In that way, \u201cBouquet\u201d is a not so furtive ode to husband Blake Shelton \u2014 who she met and fell in love with while they were both coaches on the singing reality competition show, \u201cThe Voice.\" At the time, they were both going through divorces to Gavin Rossdale and Miranda Lambert, respectively.",

      "If the album tells a story of her relationship, it starts with the opener \u201cSomebody Else's.\u201d Stefani starts off the proceedings by listing her previous romantic entanglement and bad choices. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a heart like mine/Was doin\u2019 in a love like that, ah,\" she sings. \"I don\u2019t\u205fknow\u205fwhat\u205fa woman like\u205fme/Was doin\u2019 with\u205fa man like you, ooh.\u201d",
      "It's a direct counter to the title track, where the focus appears to be back on Shelton: \u201cWe met when my heart was broken/Thank God that yours was, too,\u201d she shares. \u201cSo lucky that you were goin'/ Through what I was goin' through.\u201d",
      "In \"Late to Bloom,\u201d she decries the fact that they met so late in life.",
      "A nice bass progression, a clever turn of the phrase and a great voice are what it takes to get this album going. Add a cohesive theme, a pleasant vibe and a charismatic star \u2014- and that's coming up roses.",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- The boos from a crowd wanting more action were growing again when Jake Paul dropped his gloves before the final bell and bowed toward 58-year-old Mike Tyson.",
      "Paying homage to one of the biggest names in boxing history didn't do much for the estimated 72,000 fans who filled the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys on Friday night.",
      "Paul won an eight-round unanimous decision over Tyson as the hits didn't match the hype in a fight between the 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer and the former heavyweight champion in his first sanctioned pro bout in almost 20 years.",
      "All the hate from the prefight buildup was gone, replaced by boos from bewildered fans hoping for more from a fight that drew plenty of questions about its legitimacy long beforehand.",
      "The fight wasn't close on the judge's cards, with one giving Paul an 80-72 edge and the other two calling it 79-73.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s give it up for Mike,\u201d Paul said in the ring, not getting much response from a crowd that started filing out before the decision was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest to ever do it. I look up to him. I\u2019m inspired by him.\u201d",
      "Tyson came after Paul immediately after the opening bell and landed a couple of quick punches but didn't try much else the rest of the way.",
      "Even fewer rounds than the normal 10 or 12 and two-minute rounds instead of three, along with heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches, couldn't do much to generate action.",
      "Paul was more aggressive after the quick burst from Tyson in the opening seconds, but the punching wasn't very efficient. There were quite a few wild swings and misses.",
      "\u201cI was trying to hurt him a little bit,\u201d said Paul, who is 11-1 with seven knockouts. \u201cI was scared he was going to hurt me. I was trying to hurt him. I did my best. I did my best.\u201d",
      "Tyson mostly sat back and waited for Paul to come to him, with a few exceptions. It was quite the contrast to the co-main event, another slugfest between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in which Taylor kept her undisputed super lightweight championship with another disputed decision.",
      "Paul, who said an ankle injury limited his sparring sessions in the final weeks of training camp, said he eased up starting in about the third round because he thought Tyson was tired and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cI wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want to hurt somebody that didn't need to be hurt,\u201d Paul said.",
      "It was the first sanctioned fight since 2005 for Tyson, who fought Roy Jones Jr. in a much more entertaining exhibition in 2020. Paul started fighting a little more than four years ago.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t prove nothing to anybody, only to myself,\u201d Tyson said when asked what it meant to complete the fight. \u201cI'm not one of those guys that looks to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do.\u201d",
      "The fight was originally scheduled for July 20 but had to be postponed when Tyson was treated for a stomach ulcer after falling ill on a flight. His record is now 50-7 with 44 knockouts.",
      "Tyson slapped Paul on the face during the weigh-in a night before the fight, and they traded insults in several of the hype events, before and after the postponement.",
      "The hate was long gone by the end of the anticlimactic fight.",
      "\u201cI have so much respect for him,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat violence, war thing between us, like after he slapped me, I wanted to be aggressive and take him down and knock him out and all that stuff. That kind of went away as the rounds went on.\u201d",
      "The fight set a Texas record for combat sports with a gate of nearly $18 million, according to organizers, and Netflix had problems with the feed in the streaming platform's first live combat sports event. Netflix has more than 280 million subscribers globally.",
      "\u201cThis is the biggest event,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOver 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site.\u201d",
      "Among the celebrities on hand were basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal and former NFL star Rob Gronkowski, along with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.",
      "Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, two foes from Tyson's heyday, greeted him in his locker room before the fight.",
      "Tyson infamously bit Holyfield on the ear in a 1997 bout, and he appeared to have one of his gloves in his mouth several times during the Paul bout. He was asked if he had problem with his mouthpiece.",
      "\u201cI have a habit of biting my gloves,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI have a biting fixation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI've heard about that,\u201d the interview responded.",
      "According to reports, Paul's payday was $40 million, compared with $20 million for Tyson. Paul mentioned his number during a promotional event over the summer. Tyson has a history of legal and financial troubles but had said he didn't take the fight for money.",
      "Mario Barrios retained the WBC welterweight title in a draw with Abel Ramos on the undercard. Barrios was in control early before Ramos dominated the middle rounds. Each had a knockdown in the 12-round bout.",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions.

But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air.

      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",
      "They called on the Navy to take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its failures and immediately implement the inspector general's recommendations.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said in a statement that the inspector general's findings align with previous evaluations and support corrective actions the Navy is implementing.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to constant improvement to ensure the highest standards of operation, maintenance, safety, and oversight at all of our facilities at all times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Navy last year issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill in a move the Sierra Club called \u201cslaps on the wrist.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he welcomed the inspector general's findings, which he said underscored what environmental advocates had long alleged.",

      "NEW YORK -- Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low.",
      "The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said.",
      "Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported just since late September, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of them have been in three African countries \u2014 Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas Supreme Court ruling has again cleared the way for the execution of Robert Roberson, who would become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death over a murder conviction tied to a case of shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that some medical experts have questioned.",
      "Roberson was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2003 and had been slated to die by lethal injection on Oct. 17. But the execution was halted after a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, including some who believe Roberson is innocent, issued a last-ditch subpoena ordering Roberson to testify at the Capitol days after his execution date.",
      "The unusual tactic created a legal conundrum that successfully temporarily held off Roberson's execution. However, the Texas Supreme Court on Friday ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot stop an execution, reopening a path for the execution to proceed unless Republican Gov. Greg Abbott grants a 30-day reprieve. A new date hasn't been set yet.",

      "September 2024: A group of nearly 90 Republican and Democratic lawmakers file a clemency petition to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles urging it to spare Roberson's life because they believe his daughter died of severe pneumonia, not abuse. The former lead detective on the case, several medical experts, civil rights advocates and best-selling author John Grisham also signed the petition.",
      "Oct. 16: The parole board votes unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend to grant clemency. Abbott can only grant clemency after receiving a recommendation from the board. With the execution appearing imminent, a Texas House committee ordered Roberson to testify at a hearing scheduled after his execution date.",

      "In the other three cases in various hospitals in Zagreb, the statement said the health minister allegedly approved the purchase of microscopes at prices that were increased by 619,583 euros ($654,000) in exchange of a bribe.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs.",
      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday. The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",
      "In a prepared statement, 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the company was \"taking these difficult but necessary actions\u201d as it focuses on \u201cthe long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships.\u201d",
      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need equipment and you don\u2019t need a gym membership,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. \u201cAnd the benefits are so vast.\u201d",
      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",

      "\u201cMy cardiologist says I\u2019m doing great,\u201d he said.",
      "For all its benefits, however, walking \u201cis not enough for overall health and well-being\u201d because it doesn\u2019t provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and endurance, said Anita Gust, who teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston.",

      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",

      "Pakistan introduced mobile clinics and added more beds in hospitals to treat the nearly 70,000 patients received daily with respiratory-related diseases as hazardous smog continued to shroud the country\u2019s east",
      "MULTAN, Pakistan -- Pakistani authorities introduced mobile clinics and added more beds in hospitals to treat the nearly 70,000 patients received daily with respiratory-related diseases as hazardous smog continued to shroud the country's east, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous province with 127 million residents, has been hit by a record-high ongoing wave of pollution since October. The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children there was at risk.",
      "Lahore and Multan, the province\u2019s two main cities hit by smog, remained the two most polluted cities in the world on Wednesday, with air quality index readings of about 400, according to the Environmental Protection Department. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 200 clinics on board vehicles have been roaming the smog-hit province of Punjab since last week in search of people who can't afford treatment and the elderly who can't make it to hospitals, a top government official at the Health Department, Aun Abbas, said.",
      "Abbas said the mobile clinics are equipped to handle basic laboratory tests and doctors onboard can prescribe medication as needed.",
      "Uzma Bukhari, a spokesperson for the Punjab provincial government, said more than 2.1 million patients affected by smog have so far been treated at state-owned hospitals, adding the number is expected to grow.",
      "Schools in the province have been ordered to shut down until Nov. 17, to protect children, and all parks and museums until Nov. 18. Doctors have urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and wear face masks.",
      "\u201cMost patients with respiratory-related diseases are coming to hospitals because they did not wear face masks,\u201d said Azam Mushtaq, a medical specialist at Nishtar Hospital in Multan told The Associated Press.",
      "Asthma patients seemed to suffer the most as they had a hard time breathing even after being admitted and provided with oxygen support, according to an AP reporter on the scene.",
      "However, many violate the mask mandate and are being fined by authorities. Traffic police also penalize drivers whose vehicles emit smoke.",
      "Weather forecasters predict light rain in some of the areas in Punjab, which can help improve air quality. The government has also said it is looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution in Punjab.",

    "story": [
      "Kim Jong Un has renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion.",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion of his military nuclear program to counter U.S.-led threats in comments reported Monday that were his first direct criticism toward Washington since Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election.",
      "At a conference with army officials on Friday, Kim condemned the United States for updating its nuclear deterrence strategies with South Korea and solidifying three-way military cooperation involving Japan, which he portrayed as an \u201cAsian NATO\u201d that was escalating tensions and instability in the region.",
      "Kim also criticized the United States over its support of Ukraine against a prolonged Russian invasion. He insisted that Washington and its Western allies were using Ukraine as their \u201cshock troops\u201d to wage a war against Moscow and expand the scope of U.S. military influence, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said.",
      "Kim has prioritized his country\u2019s ties to Russia in recent months, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d and displaying a united front in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s broader conflicts with the West.",
      "He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine and the KCNA\u2019s report didn\u2019t mention whether Kim made any comments toward Trump, whose election win has yet to be reported in the North\u2019s state media.",
      "Kim met Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 in Trump\u2019s first presidency, but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements in exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions and North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. North Korea has since suspended any meaningful talks with Washington and Seoul as Kim ramped up his testing activity and military demonstrations in the face of what he portrayed as \u201cgangster-like U.S. threats.\u201d There\u2019s concern in Seoul that Kim in exchange for his military support of Russia would receive Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.",
      "Trump\u2019s election win has touched off speculation about a resumption of a summit-driven diplomacy with Kim, which was described by critics as a \u201cbromance.\u201d But some experts say a quick return to 2018 is highly unlikely, as too much has changed about the regional security situation and broader geopolitics since then.",
      "While the North Korean nuclear problem was relatively an independent issue during Trump\u2019s first term, it is now connected with broader challenges created by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and further complicated by weakened sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang, Hwang Ildo, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a study last week.",
      "North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program is now much more advanced, which would increase Kim\u2019s perception of his bargaining powers. Kim\u2019s efforts to boost North Korea\u2019s presence in a united front against Washington could also gain strength if Trump spikes tariffs and rekindles a trade war with China, the North\u2019s main ally and economic lifeline, Hwang said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked.",
      "Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South\u2019s biggest airport.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea again flew trash-laden balloons toward the South early Monday and issued a statement warning the North \u201cnot to test our military\u2019s patience any further.\u201d The North has launched about 7,000 balloons toward the South since May, causing property damage but so far no injuries. On at least two occasions, trash carried by North Korea\u2019s balloons fell on Seoul\u2019s presidential compound, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key sites.",

      "A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides, who face charges of crimes against humanity after hundreds of people were killed in a mass uprising this summer.",
      "Golam Mortuza Majumdar, the head judge of the three-member International Crimes Tribunal, set Dec. 17 for investigators to finish their work, as the tribunal heard updates Monday from police about what the country's security agencies have done to arrest Hasina and her close aides.",
      "The decision came after prosecutors sought more time for the investigation.",
      "Mohammed Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of the tribunal, told the judges during Monday's hearing that they were working in line with an extradition treaty signed earlier with India to make Hasina's return possible.",
      "Hasina has been living in exile in India since Aug. 5 when she fled the country amid the student-led protests. The Dhaka-based tribunal on Oct. 17 issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others, including former Cabinet ministers, advisers and military and civil officials. The country is now being run by an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.",
      "At least 13 people, including a former law minister and a businessman who was Hasina\u2019s private-sector adviser, appeared before the tribunal on Monday, said B.M. Sultan Mahmud, a prosecutor at the tribunal. One former Cabinet minister was not brought to the tribunal as he was in custody for police interrogation in a separate case. A further six people will appear on Wednesday, tribunal officials said. At least 20 suspects have been arrested in the case.",
      "The tribunal will also seek updates from police on their progress in arresting the other suspects, including Hasina.",
      "After the hearing on Monday, the tribunal\u2019s head judge ordered authorities to send all 13 suspects to jail, pending investigation.",
      "The chief prosecutor of the tribunal has already sought help from Interpol through the country\u2019s police chief to arrest Hasina. On Sunday, Yunus said in an address to the nation that his administration would seek Hasina's extradition from India.",
      "Authorities say hundreds of people were killed during the uprising in July and August, mainly by security agents seeking to quell the initial protests over government jobs. The violence intensified as the protests morphed into an anti-government movement, with more bloodshed, ending Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule. Hasina had also earlier sought an investigation into the killings."

    "summary": "When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn&rsquo;t last long against a much larger enemy",
    "story": [
      "When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn\u2019t last long against a much larger enemy",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn\u2019t last long against a much larger enemy.",
      "Instead, it was that narrative that quickly collapsed. The Ukrainian army proved it could slow the advance of Russia\u2019s forces and, if not drive them out completely, then \u2013 with enough support from the West \u2013 at least forestall defeat.",
      "But nearly three years later, the outlook is again grim. Russia is expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls. Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling to minimize losses, maintain morale and convince allies that, with more military aid, it can turn the tide.",
      "As this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. President-elect Donald Trump has said he could quickly end the war, though it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales.",
      "This backdrop appears to be driving Russia\u2019s strategy in eastern Ukraine, according to Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. Trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump cuts aid to Ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, Russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "For Ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the West that it won't allow Russia to re-invade in the future. Otherwise, O'Brien said, \u201ca cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in Europe.\u201d",
      "In the war's first year, Ukraine lost huge amounts of territory \u2014 but it also achieved notable victories. It resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land through gutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog \u2014 and its wealthy allies \u2014 the confidence to stay in the fight.",
      "In the second year, which was punctuated by Ukraine's devastating loss of Bakhmut and its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) front line. Toward the end of that year, the U.S. Congress delayed the approval of a $61 billion package of aid for weapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance.",
      "With Ukraine's ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war\u2019s third year began. In February 2024, the town of Avdiivka fell after months of airstrikes by Russia, which used highly destructive Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems.",
      "The fall of Avdiivka created a major breach in Ukraine\u2019s defenses. When Russia later mounted an assault on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian troops were stretched further.",
      "A bright spot for Ukraine came in August, when it launched a surprise incursion into Russia. It took \u2014 and still holds \u2014 hundreds of square kilometers in the Kursk region. While this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn't stopped Russian forces from taking more land in Ukraine's east.",
      "\u201cThe Russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they\u2019re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day,\u201d said Justin Crump, head of the British strategic advisory firm Sibylline.",
      "Tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the U.N. says at least 11,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.",
      "While the amount of land Russia has gained in 2024 \u2014 about 2,455 square kilometers (948 square miles)\u2014 is equal to less than 1% of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact.",
      "With Ukraine in retreat, \u201cwe\u2019ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war's) first months,\u201d said Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst at CBA Initiatives Center in Kyiv. \u201cThis strengthens Russia\u2019s position \u2014 not so much militarily, but in terms of morale.\u201d",
      "To keep its war machine going, Russia \u2014 like Ukraine \u2014 has turned to allies for help.",
      "Iran supplies Russia with drones and possibly missiles, and North Korea has sent ammunition \u2014 and even troops, who have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this year that 700,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine. Analysts say Putin would need a much larger force to accelerate Russia\u2019s advance, but that he is unlikely to mobilize more troops because it could stoke internal discontent.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s foothold in Kursk is another complicating factor for Putin, and it could be used as a bargaining chip in any future cease-fire negotiations.",
      "Captain Yevhen Karas, a Ukrainian commander in Kursk, said the fighting inside Russia is highly dynamic, but he believes it will prove effective in diverting Russia's attention and resources.",
      "\u201cEven a creeping, retreating front exhausts the enemy significantly,\u201d Karas said.",
      "Ukraine has asked the West for longer range missiles and its blessing to fire at air bases deep inside Russia. But its allies have so far resisted, wary of escalating tensions with a nuclear-armed Russia.",
      "The U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. Soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained American support.",
      "\u201cBravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough,\u201d said a Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules.",
      "The soldier estimated that where he is stationed Russian infantry outnumber Ukrainian troops 10 to 1. As the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to keep replacing troops.",
      "What direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming Trump administration plays its hand.",
      "Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine.",
      "During his only campaign debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win \u2014 raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations.",
      "Without security guarantees from the West, Ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future Russian aggression. Analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that Europe's borders are up for grabs through military action \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened since World War II.",

      "Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the biggest case under a national security law that critics say has crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city",
      "HONG KONG -- Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.",
      "The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment.",
      "The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader.",
      "Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms.",
      "Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant.",
      "Here are profiles of some of the leading activists.",
      "Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters \u2014 over 13% of the city\u2019s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election.",
      "The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a \u201cconstitutional weapon of mass destruction\" that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city\u2019s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature.",
      "The judges said Tai aimed to \u201cundermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure\u201d of Hong Kong.",
      "Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal.",
      "Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022.",
      "Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city\u2019s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city\u2019s leader.",
      "Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city\u2019s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.",
      "In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named \u201cDemosisto\u201d with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who \u201cbegged for interference\u201d by foreign forces.",
      "Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped \u201che could part with his history and would be able to reform himself\u201d after completing it.",
      "Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service.",
      "Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him.",
      "Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals.",
      "Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty.",
      "The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai.",
      "In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.",

    "story": [
      "Brazil is hosting the Group of 20 summit and it appears unlikely the industrialized and emerging-market nations in attendance will sign a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- With Brazil preparing to host the Group of 20 summit, it appears unlikely the leading rich and developing nations will sign on to a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics: The meeting Monday and Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro is overshadowed by two major wars and Donald Trump's recent election victory.",
      "Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration have tempered any expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Experts instead anticipate a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger \u2014 one of Brazil's priorities \u2014 even if it aims to include at least a mention of the ongoing wars.",
      "\u201cBrazilian diplomacy has been strongly engaged in this task, but to expect a substantively strong and consensual declaration in a year like 2024 with two serious international conflicts is to set the bar very high,\u201d said Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, an international relations professor at the University of Sao Paulo.",
      "After Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silvathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat \u2014 who Barack Obama once called \u201cthe most popular politician on Earth\u201d \u2014 hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little personal interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: \u201cBrazil is back.\"",
      "Brazil under Lula has reverted to its decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world. That involves talking to all parties, which experts say gave Brazil a privileged position to host a summit such as the G20.",
      "But his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows. A Brazil-China peace plan for Russia and Ukraine doesn't call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine and has been slammed by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And Lula sparked a diplomatic incident with Israel after comparing its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an America First doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues.",
      "\u201cIf we have one certainty, it is regarding Donald Trump\u2019s skepticism towards multilateralism,\u201d Carneiro said.",
      "Two officials from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators are standing in the way of a joint declaration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two of them said Argentina\u2019s negotiators have raised several objections to the draft. They most vehemently oppose a clause calling for a global tax on the super-rich \u2014 which they had previously accepted, in July \u2014 and another promoting gender equality.",
      "Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil\u2019s key negotiator at G20, told journalists on Nov. 8 that the leaders\u2019 final declaration should address the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, but that diplomats were still discussing how to reach universally acceptable language.",
      "\u201cThe main message, naturally, is that we need to achieve peace not only regarding these conflicts but all conflicts,\u201d he said in the capital Brasilia, adding that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement.",
      "\u201cThe leaders\u2019 declaration will be the crowning achievement. But, at the same time, as instructed by the president himself, we have a G20 focused on concrete actions, such as the launch of a Global Alliance Against Hunger, with a package of very concrete social programs and innovative mechanisms to meet the resources needed for implementing them.\u201d",
      "Lula, a former trade unionist who hails from a humble background, made the fight against hunger a priority during his first two terms as president (2003-2010) both at home and abroad. The number of undernourished Brazilians fell by more than 80% in 10 years, according to a 2014 U.N. report.",
      "Lula's hunger alliance is the only one of Brazil\u2019s primary aims for a G20 declaration that will be obtained, according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio.",
      "\u201cBrazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the super rich. Only the first one has survived,\u201d Traumann said.",
      "President Joe Biden will attend the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and then travel on to Manaus, a city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It will be the first time a sitting American president sets foot in the Amazon, and the trip\u2019s objective is to highlight \u201ccommitment to environmental protection and respect for local cultures,\u201d according to a Nov. 12 statement from the U.S. Embassy in Brazil.",
      "White House officials insist that Biden\u2019s visits to APEC and the G20 will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia\u2019s invasion and not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza.",
      "Any commitments Biden makes may be overturned by the next White House administration, according to Danielle Ayres, an international relations professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina.",
      "\u201cIt would mean Trump would have to be proactive and say the U.S. is not going to do something to which it signed up for internationally,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cThat has a cost. It generates insecurity, a bad perception on behalf of the international community towards Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election may also cause other countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. Xi Jinping's inauguration of the Chancay megaport in Peru on Thursday was perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America\u2019s reorientation. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet Xi Monday, the first meeting between British and Chinese leaders since 2018. Starmer\u2019s office says the U.K. leader is seeking to repair relations with Beijing after years of acrimony over human rights, Hong Kong and what U.K. officials say are Beijing\u2019s attempts to exert influence on British politics.",
      "A notable absentee at the G20 will be Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, against whom the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him, and Russia\u2019s delegation will be led by Sergey Lavrov. Israel is not a G20 member.",
      "\u201cThe latest G20 meetings were somewhat depleted and became just another moment for bilateral meetings of heads of government. As Putin is out, Lula managed Ukraine not to be a topic, just as much as Israel. But Trump\u2019s election takes from Lula the chance of being the star on the stage,\u201d Traumann said.",

      "Biden, the first sitting U.S. president to visit the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, saw up close the ravages of deforestation. The Amazon, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas driving climate change. But development is rapidly depleting the long-verdant region, where rivers have been running dry.",
      "Flanked by giant ferns in the forest, Biden said the fight against climate change has been a defining cause of his presidency \u2014 he\u2019s pushed for cleaner air, water and energy and achieved legislation that steered unprecedented federal spending to the fight against global warming.",
      "But he's about to hand off to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change, which he's cast as a \u201choax.\"",
      "Trump has pledged to again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, and he says he'll rescind unspent money in energy efficiency legislation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that\u2019s underway in America,\u201d Biden said from a podium set up on a sandy forest bed. \u201cBut nobody, nobody can reverse it, nobody \u2014 not when so many people, regardless of party or politics, are enjoying its benefits.\u201d",
      "The question now, he said, is \u201cwhich government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous opportunity.\u201d",
      "His trip comes as the U.N. climate conference is underway in Azerbaijan. Brazil will hold the talks next year.",
      "During a helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River\u2019s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.",
      "Biden met Indigenous leaders \u2014 introducing his daughter and granddaughter \u2014 and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where Indigenous women shook maracas as apart of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day.",
      "The U.S. president leaned into the symbolism of his trip, saying the Amazon might be the \u201clungs of the world,\u201d but \u201cin my view, our forest and national wonders are the heart and soul of the world. They unite us. They inspire us to make us proud of our countries and our heritage.\u201d",
      "The Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.",
      "During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the U.S. was on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a sixfold increase from when he started his term. Poorer nations struggling with rising seas and other effects of climate change say the U.S. and other wealthier nations have yet to fulfill their pledges to help.",
      "\u201cThe fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden's administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway.",
      "The U.S. has said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution.",
      "Biden's trip was significant, but \"we can\u2019t expect concrete results from this visit,\" said Suely Ara\u00fajo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory.",
      "She doubts that a \u201csingle penny\u201d will go to the Amazon Fund once Trump is in the White House.",
      "The Biden administration touted a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change.",
      "That includes the launch of a finance coalition looking to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030 as well as a $37.5 million loan to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil.",
      "The Amazon has been suffering under two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of river communities and hindered riverine dwellers\u2019 ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke.",
      "When Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Lula has pledged \u201czero deforestation\u201d by 2030, though his term runs through 2026. Forest loss in Brazil\u2019s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, official data released last week said.",
      "In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year\u2019s reading.",
      "Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula\u2019s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports.",
      "While Biden is the first sitting president in the Amazon, former President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to the region with the help of the American Museum of Natural History following his 1912 loss to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, joined by his son and naturalists, traversed roughly 15,000 miles, and the former president fell ill with malaria and suffered a serious leg infection after a boat accident.",
      "Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "After his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit.",

      "President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia",
      "MANAUS, Brazil -- President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter.",
      "The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces.",
      "Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine.",
      "The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained.",
      "\u201cStrikes are not made with words,\" he said during his nightly video address. \u201cSuch things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.",
      "Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia.",
      "Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow\u2019s intentions to devastate Ukraine\u2019s power generation capacity before the winter.",
      "\u201cAnd this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "The comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years.",
      "Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies.",
      "Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.",
      "Putin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory.",
      "News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.",
      "Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit.",
      "Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is \u201cto avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want peace, we want fair peace,\u201d Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate.",
      "The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea\u2019s decision to support Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development.",
      "The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources.",
      "North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.",
      "As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",
      "Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win.",
      "He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine\u2019s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin.",
      "America is Ukraine\u2019s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022.",
      "Worried about Russia\u2019s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies.",
      "That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy\u2019s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems.",
      "The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia.",

      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, signed the legally binding General Security of Military Information Agreement in Manila at a time when the longtime treaty allies have boosted their defense and military engagements, including large-scale joint combat drills, largely in response to China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia.",

      "The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information that would be exchanged between the U.S. and the Philippines.",
      "It will \u201callow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,\u201d the Philippine defense department said.",
      "Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement.",
      "Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems.",
      "It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months.",
      "Austin and Teodoro also attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a center where the U.S. and Philippine militaries would coordinate future joint operations, including the exchange of information. Austin said the center \u201cwill be a place where our forces can work side-by-side to respond to regional challenges.\"",
      "Austin renewed the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as an ally and told Teodoro that \u201cwe are more than allies. We are family.\"",
      "The coordinating center, Teodoro said, would provide \u201ca unified picture of the shared areas of responsibility and common approaches to threats against both our securities.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m sure it will benefit future generations of both our peoples to come because although we may change people, the values don\u2019t change,\u201d Teodoro said.",
      "The Philippine defense chief reiterated the crucial need for the U.S. security presence in the region, citing Marcos\u2019s repeated statements that such a presence \u201cis essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region.\"",

      "Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid.",

Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said.",
      "Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said.",
      "Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi\u2019s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province.",
      "More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense.",
      "Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said.",
      "In the worst-hit province of Camarines, officials pleaded for additional help after fierce winds and rain damaged more houses and cut off electricity and water supplies in the entire province, along with cellphone connections in many areas, provincial information officer Camille Gianan said.",
      "Welfare officials transported food aid, drinking water and other help but more is needed over the coming months, Gianan said. Many villagers will need construction materials to rebuild their houses, she said.",
      "\u201cThey have not recovered from the previous storms when the super typhoon hit,\u201d Gianan told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been one calamity after another.\u201d",

The capital region of metropolitan Manila would likely be spared from a direct hit but was placed, along with outlying regions, under storm alerts and warned of dangerous coastal storm surges.",
      "\u201cThe rain was minimal, but the wind was very strong and had this eerie howling sound,\u201d Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer in Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cAlong a main boulevard here, the tidal surges went up to more than 7 meters (23 feet) near the seaside houses. It looked really scary.\u201d",
      "The entire province of Catanduanes had no power after the typhoon knocked down trees and electricity posts, and disaster-response teams were checking how many more houses were damaged in addition to those impacted by previous storms, he said.",
      "\"We need tin roofs and other construction materials, aside from food. Villagers tell us here that they still haven\u2019t gotten up from the past storm and were pinned down again by this typhoon,\u201d Monterola said. Nearly half of the island province\u2019s 80,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers.",
      "Catanduanes officials were so concerned as the typhoon approached that they threatened vulnerable villagers with arrest if they did not follow orders to evacuate to safer grounds.

      "After 1,000 days of war, a makeshift memorial has grown in the heart of Kyiv with thousands of blue-and-yellow flags honoring soldiers who died defending Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Before Russia\u2019s invasion, this was an ordinary green lawn in the heart of Ukraine\u2019s capital. Tourists would visit to take photos, and locals would stroll there on weekends.",
      "But 1,000 days of war have transformed it into a makeshift memorial, dotted with blue-and-yellow flags \u2014 each honoring a soldier who died fighting Russia. Many were volunteers who left their civilian lives behind to answer to defend their country.",
      "Their loved ones, left alone with grief, hope their sacrifices won\u2019t be forgotten. They plant small, simple flags, hand-marked with the names and dates they died. Over time, the flags have multiplied, fluttering in the wind as the seasons change and the war drags on.",
      "\u201cI put it so that someone might pass by and see that this person once lived and gave their life for us,\u201d said Svitlana Kirichenko, who traveled from Cherkasy to replace the weathered flag she had planted over a year ago in honor of her son, who died fighting. She carefully placed a new one in its place.",
      "\u201cSo we can live peacefully among our own people, and not have Russians dictate how we should live and what to do.\u201d",
      "Associated Press archives show that the first flags appeared on the lawn in May of the war\u2019s first year, shortly after Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region and the capital was no longer under the threat of occupation. Photos from that time show dozens of flags neatly arranged in rows across the grassy field.",
      "As the war continued, the place has transformed. The grass has faded away, replaced by well-worn paths resembling those in a cemetery, winding through thousands of flags. Among them, many portraits have appeared \u2014 brought by relative \u2014 showing confident, smiling faces in military uniforms.",
      "Svitlana Kanevska, cloaked in a black hood against the drizzly autumn rain, bent over a portrait of her boyfriend, Serhii Ivanytskyi, who had died months earlier in eastern Ukraine. The photo \u2014 a selfie he had sent her during one of their chats \u2014 showed him standing in a sunlit Ukrainian field. Kanevska carefully wiped droplets from the image.",
      "Since Serhii joined the army early in the war, their time together had been scarce, mostly confined to messages. He kept his location and activities hidden, and their conversations centered largely on love.",
      "Last December, during a brief leave in Kyiv, they passed by this very memorial. \u201cHe said he felt so sorry for the guys,\u201d Kanevska recalled. He was killed in the summer of 2024.",
      "\u201cYou feel so much pain that you don\u2019t know where to go or what to do,\u201d she said. That\u2019s what brought her here months ago, to place his flag and photo among the countless others. Kanevska, who works nearby, often visits to mourn.",
      "She\u2019s not alone. The place is strewn with fresh and dried flowers, a concentration of grief and an epicenter of Ukrainian history. Independence Square, after all, has long been the heart of Ukraine\u2019s revolutions. For many, it is the only fitting place for their loved ones to be remembered.",
      "City authorities have no control over this memorial. It was created by people themselves, driven by a deep need to honor their fallen in the absence of an official government memorial.",
      "Soldiers and families come here to sit for long stretches, gazing quietly into the distance. New flags are added almost daily.",
      "Nearby, funeral ceremonies take place almost every day, followed by moments of silence. Passersby stop, kneel and observe in quiet reverence. But soon, life in the capital moves on, returning to its usual pace.",
      "The memorial keeps growing with each passing day, a reminder of the price Ukraine pays for its freedom.",
      "\u201cIf someone thinks of him, it brings him light where he is. He knows he hasn\u2019t been forgotten,\u201d said Andrii Pedychenko, who came to the memorial to put a new flag for his friend who was killed in action about one year ago. \u201cEach flag is a tragedy. And it reminds us that this is just a small piece because there wouldn\u2019t be enough space here for everyone.\u201d",

      "The defendants are accused of transferring babies to neonatal units of 19 private hospitals where the infants were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments. At least 10 newborns are alleged to have died in the past year due to neglect or malpractice in facilities that were unprepared to treat them.",
      "Prosecutors at the trial, which opened in Istanbul on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies\u2019 condition appear more serious with the aim obtaining payments from the social security institution.",
      "The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and face punishment for unavoidable unwanted outcomes.",
      "The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for a greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal.",
      "Dr. Firat Sari, the main defendant who operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul, is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison.",
      "He is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents, and homicide by negligence.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",
      "He told prosecutors: \u201cEverything is in accordance with procedures.\u201d",

      "Among them is Hacire Akinci, 42, who lost her baby last year after eight years of fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cThey gave us a medical report that said the baby had died of natural causes. But apparently that wasn't the case,\u201d she told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cI want charges to be brought, I want justice to be served.\u201d",
      "The case has led to calls for the resignation of Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, who was the Istanbul provincial health director at the time some of the deaths occurred. Ozgur Ozel, the main opposition party leader, has called for all hospitals involved to be seized by the state and nationalized.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all the blame on the country\u2019s health care system.",

      "The U.S. antitrust watchdogs that pounced on Big Tech and deterred dealmaking throughout corporate America during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration may be tamer and kept on a shorter leash by President-elect Donald Trump after he returns to the Whit...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. antitrust watchdogs that pounced on Big Tech and deterred corporate deal making throughout President Joe Biden's administration may be kept on a shorter leash by Donald Trump after he returns to the White House next year.",
      "Although regulators began cracking down on tech powerhouses such as Google and Facebook during Trump's first term as president, most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under Biden's watch.",
      "One of the biggest reasons underlying the anticipated pivot stems from the widespread belief that the chief architects of the Biden administration's get-tougher stance \u2014 Lina Khan of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter \u2014 won't be part of the Trump regime.",
      "Both the Justice Department and FTC didn't respond to request for comment.",
      "Trump's announcement of billionaire Elon Musk, who once anointed himself as \u201cTechnoking,\u201d to oversee an advisory effort focused on slashing government spending could end up reducing the staffs and regulators trying to rein in deep-pocketed companies.",
      "And Trump's nomination of combative supporter Matt Gaetz to be U.S. Attorney General has thrown even more uncertainty into the game. Gaetz has previously lashed out at social media platforms' policies he claims suppress conservative views, and has, at times, joined in on calls to break up Big Tech. He also has a track record of supporting causes trumpeted by Trump.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some profound changes\" in antitrust policies, predicts John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University that has periodically worked on antitrust issues with the FTC and Justice Department. \u201cElon Musk could end up having a larger-than-life influence on policy, and that isn't something we have seen before, where a single person whispers in the ear of the President.\"",
      "Other experts interviewed by The Associated Press mostly agree with Kwoka's sentiments. But they also believe it's highly unlikely the anticipated shift will result in regulators abandoning existing antitrust cases against Big Tech firms, partly because those legal showdowns coalesce with populist worries about the industry's increasing power and influence on people's lives.",
      "\u201cWe are in uncharted territory, but the idea of going up against Big Tech still has legs to it,\u201d said Rebecca Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who tracks antitrust issues.",
      "But the changing of the guard may open a door for Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to avert prolonged court battles and negotiate settlements under a president that relishes in deal making.",
      "\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d",
      "While the fate of existing antitrust cases remains in a realm of pure speculation, almost everyone is betting the Trump administration will be more receptive to mergers that typically come with a promise of lower costs and other benefits for consumers.",
      "The stage is set for \u201ca golden era for deal flow among public and private tech players over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note after Trump's reelection.",
      "It's a belief widely shared by most investors, which helped fuel a run up in the overall stock market since Election Day and boosted shares in companies trying to close deals announced during the Biden administration. One such example involves Capital One Financial and Discover, who aim to consummate their merger in a stock swap next year. Capital One's market value has increased by 11% while Discover's market value has climbed 16%.",
      "The change in administration could also sway a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. But the FTC filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. But the two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "Given grocery prices remain a hot-button issue among consumers still feeling shell shocked from post-pandemic inflationary spikes, Allensworth believes the Trump administration is less likely to \u201cabandon or soft pedal\" the FTC's challenge to the Kroger-Albertsons merger.",
      "In another case that has been cheered by hordes of consumers, the Justice Department is seeking to break up Ticketmaster and its corporate parent Live Nation in a lawsuit claiming their practices are driving up the cost of concerts and other entertainment.",
      "Despite the grassroots support for that case, Live Nation executives are signaling they think they can preserve the current system under a Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cWe are hopeful that we\u2019ll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach, where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace,\u201d Live Nation President Joe Berchtold said during a conference call with investors shortly after the election.",
      "Deals that got torpedoed by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. American and JetBlue are already considering resurrecting a partnership after an earlier proposal got torpedoed by a legal challenge by Biden's antitrust team \u2014 a decision that was recently upheld by a Boston appeals court.",
      "\u201cWe are still taking a look at it,\u201d American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said shortly after the election. \u201cWe will take everything that the court has fed back, and we\u2019ll put that into consideration.\"",
      "Similar conversations are likely taking place among other executives re-examining deals that seemed off-limits during the Biden administration, said Colin Kass, an antitrust attorney at the law firm Proskauer Rose,",
      "\u201cIt's almost certain there were deals that people put the brakes on because of antitrust concerns and those will be revisited to decide whether they still make economic sense,\u201d Kass said. \u201cIf so, they will present it to the DOJ. And if there needs to be a fix, it\u2019s more likely to get fixed than blocked outright. So it\u2019s worth taking a chance at getting these deals done.\u201d",
      "As for the efforts to dismantle Big Tech monopolies, the first case brought by the Trump administration against Google is now in the hands of a federal judge who ruled in August that the company's dominant search engine is an illegal monopoly. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. is now weighing what kind of punishment to impose on Google. A decision is expected by August next year.",
      "In a preliminary proposal filed last month, the Justice Department indicated it might try to persuade Mehta to order that key parts of Google be broken up to restore competition.",
      "The Justice Department's final draft of recommended penalties is due this Wednesday. The filing isn't likely to be influenced by the specter of the Trump administration taking over next January as Kanter and the rest of the team he assembled at Justice get one final chance to state their case against Google, said David Olson, an associate law professor for Boston College.",
      "A reshuffled team of antitrust regulators appointed by Trump could still backtrack from whatever position is staked out in the Nov. 20 filing and take a different stance when Mehta presides over the hearings about the proposed punishments next spring.",
      "\u201cIt is disheartening to see,\u201d Kwoka said. \u201cA tougher policy was in order because the tech companies in particular had been allowed to behave without any significant restraint for 20 years. And then we all recognized it was going to take more than four years to establish a tougher policy and show its merits. Now, that may not happen.\u201d",

      "Picketing is continuing outside a hotel-casino near the Las Vegas Strip with no talks scheduled between management and union members",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Picketing continued Sunday outside a hotel-casino near the Las Vegas Strip that remained open with no talks scheduled between management and union members striking for a new contract.",
      "Workers are seeking a pay raise and benefits comparable to pacts reached last year at other resorts.",
      "The walkout by about 700 Culinary Workers Union laborers at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas comes a week before the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix is due to draw hundreds of thousands of fans for Formula 1 racing on the Strip and nearby streets. It's the first open-ended strike since 2002 for the largest labor union in Nevada, which has about 60,000 members.",
      "No new negotiations were scheduled, said union spokesperson Bethany Khan and Terri Maruca, media representative for Virgin Hotels, owner of the 1,500-room property.",
      "Maruca said the company has fielded applications from more than 600 prospective contract and temporary workers since Friday. The union pays striking workers $500 per week for at least five days for picketing shifts.",
      "Guest room attendants, cocktail and food servers, bartenders, laundry and kitchen workers are among workers represented by the Culinary Union at the property, where the union also staged a 48-hour job action last May to call for Virgin Hotels to agree to a new five-year deal with expanded benefits and increased wages.",
      "The company reached a contract agreement last week with 105 members of the Teamsters Union, including front desk, valet and call center workers, Maruca said.",
      "Other casinos on and off the Strip reached agreements with the union just before the Formula 1 race a year ago, with contracts containing salary increases of about 32% over five years for tens of thousands of workers at properties including the Bellagio, Paris Las Vegas, MGM Grand and Caesars Palace.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, Virgin Hotels called those contracts \u201ceconomically unsustainable\u201d and said it wants a \u201creasonable agreement\u201d for its 1,710 employees. It has accused union leaders of refusing to engage in \"meaningful negotiations.\u201d",
      "Culinary Union members last went on strike in 2002 for 10 days at the Golden Gate hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas."

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority, and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cThe chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\u201d he told investors during an earnings call. \u201cWe are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "PARIS -- French farmers are mobilizing for widespread protests on Monday targeting the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. Backed by their government, they argue the deal threatens their livelihoods by allowing a surge of South American agricultural imports produced under less stringent environmental standards.",
      "Protests are planned nationwide, including gatherings at prefectures and traffic circles. So far, protests have been small. One group blocked a highway southwest of Paris on Sunday night with tractors. Witnesses at Velizy-Villacoublay said that some 20 tractors stationed by placard-holding farmers overnight on the N118 freeway artery toward Paris had left by late Monday morning.",
      "The European Union and the Mercosur trade bloc, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reached an initial agreement in 2019, but negotiations stumbled due to opposition from farmers and some European governments, particularly France.",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable as it stands,\u201d said French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot.",
      "But France's hands might be tied.",
      "There are fears the agreement could be finalized at the G20 summit in Brazil this week, or in the coming weeks. A partial EU-Mercosur deal, with many of the parts that French farmers find unsavory, could be agreed over their heads since France does not hold veto power.",
      "Other nations like Germany and Spain would like to see a far-reaching deal with their South American counterparts.",
      "\u201cThere is a certain mythology surrounding Mercosur,\u201d said Spanish Farm Minister Luis Planas Puchades, who argues there is more at stake than just farming.",
      "\u201cIs the European Union interested, at this moment, in closing in on itself?\u201d he asked ahead of an EU farm ministerial meeting on Monday. \u201cOr is it interested, in this particular geopolitical context that we are experiencing, and especially after the North American election, in expanding the network of our trade agreements with third countries to maintain our economic and commercial influence as well? I think the answer is very clear.\u201d",
      "Leading the charge of the new protests in France are unions, who oppose provisions such as duty-free imports of beef, poultry and sugar, which they say create unfair competition. Coordination Rurale, a union linked to the far right, has promised an \u201cagricultural revolt,\u201d including food freight blockades beginning Tuesday in Auch and Agen, in southwestern France.",
      "Proponents of the agreement argue that it would significantly boost economic ties between Europe and South America by eliminating tariffs on European exports, notably for machinery, chemicals and cars, thereby enhancing market access and creating lucrative opportunities for European businesses.",
      "Earlier this year, farmers staged protests across France and elsewhere in Europe, blocking roads and buildings to protest EU regulations and financial problems, demand fairer agricultural policies and oppose the trade agreement.",
      "French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard has publicly opposed the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, citing risks of deforestation and health concerns linked to hormone-treated meat.",
      "In an interview with TF1, she said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this agreement because it\u2019s harmful. It will bring in products, including substances banned in Europe, at the cost of deforestation. It will unfairly compete with our domestic production.\u201d",
      "President Emmanuel Macron has also criticized the agreement unless South American producers meet EU standards.",
      "Farmers say they are further frustrated by a European Commission audit that flagged hormone use in Brazilian beef exports. Their demonstrations aim to pressure the French government and EU officials to block or renegotiate the agreement."

      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest under changes to a sweeping forest management plan that\u2019s been in place for three decades",
      "U.S. officials would allow increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest in the name of fighting wildfires and boosting rural economies under proposed changes to a sweeping forest management plan that\u2019s been in place for three decades.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service proposal, released Friday, would overhaul the Northwest Forest Plan that governs about 38,000 square miles (99,000 square kilometers) in Oregon, Washington and California.",
      "The plan was adopted in 1994 under President Bill Clinton amid pressure to curb destructive logging practices that resulted in widespread clearcuts and destroyed habitat used by spotted owls. Timber harvests dropped dramatically in subsequent years, spurring political backlash.",
      "But federal officials now say worsening wildfires due to climate change mean forests must be more actively managed to increase their resiliency. Increased logging also would provide a more predictable supply of trees for timber companies, officials said, helping rural economies that have suffered after lumber mills shut down and forestry jobs disappeared.",
      "The proposal could increase annual timber harvests by at least 33% and potentially more than 200%, according to a draft environmental study. The number of timber-related jobs would increase accordingly.",
      "Harvest volumes from the 17 national forests covered by the Northwest Forest Plan averaged about 445 million board feet annually over the past decade, according to government figures.",
      "Cutting more trees would help reduce wildfire risk and make communities safer, the study concluded. That would be accomplished in part by allowing cuts in some areas with stands of trees up to 120 years old \u2014 up from the current age threshold of 80 years.",
      "The change could help foster conditions conducive to growing larger, old growth trees that are more resistant to fire, by removing younger trees, officials said.",
      "A separate pending proposal from President Joe Biden's administration aims to increase protections nationwide for old growth trees, which play a significant role in storing climate change-inducing carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cMuch has changed in society and science since the Northwest Forest Plan was created,\u201d Jacque Buchanan, regional forester for the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Region, said in a statement. He said the proposal would help the agency adapt to shifting conditions, as global warming increases the frequency of droughts and other extreme weather events.",
      "The proposed plan also calls for closer cooperation between the Forest Service and Native American tribes to tap into tribal knowledge about forest management. Tribes were excluded when the 1994 plan was crafted.",
      "Environmentalists greeted the proposal with skepticism. The group Oregon Wild said it was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d that the Forest Service would release the proposal just ahead of a change in presidential administrations.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the Forest Service wants to abandon the fundamental purpose of the Northwest Forest Plan\u2013protecting fish and wildlife and the mature and old-growth forests they need to survive,\u201d John Persell, an attorney for the group, said in a statement.",
      "During former President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, administration officials sought to open millions of acres of West Coast forest to new logging by stripping habitat protections for the imperiled spotted owl. The move was opposed by government biologists and reversed under Biden.",
      "A draft environmental study examined several potential alternatives, including leaving the existing plan\u2019s components in place or changing them to either reduce or increase logging.",
      "A timber industry representative who co-chaired an advisory committee on the Northwest Forest Plan said the proposed plan resulted from discussions involving committee members, the Forest Service and others.",
      "\u201cWe want to see a modern approach to federal forest stewardship that protects us from catastrophic wildfires, reduces toxic smoke, meaningfully engages tribes, and delivers for our rural communities and workers,\u201d said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council.",
      "The publishing of the proposal begins a 120-day public comment period. The Forest Service's environmental review is expected to be completed by next fall and a final decision is due in early 2026."

      "Suspected attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have targeted a commercial ship traveling through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship traveling through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, though no damage or injuries were reported, authorities said Monday.",
      "The attacks come as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel\u2019s ground offensive in Lebanon.",
      "The ship's captain saw that \u201ca missile splashed in close proximity to the vessel\u201d as it traveled in the southern Red Sea near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting to the Gulf of Aden in the first attack late Sunday night, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in an alert. The attack happened some 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Yemen port city of Mocha.",
      "On Monday, another attack some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Aden in the Gulf of Aden similarly saw a missile splash down close to the vessel, the UKMTO said.",
      "\u201cThe vessel and crew are safe and proceeding to its next port of call,\u201d the UKMTO added.",
      "The Houthis did not immediately claim the attacks. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well.",
      "In the rebels' last attack on Nov. 11, two U.S. Navy warships targeted with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful."

      "A New York judge has rejected an effort by state regulators to shutter a bitcoin mine over concerns about its greenhouse gas emissions",
      "NEW YORK -- A cryptocurrency plant in central New York can continue operating after a court rejected the state\u2019s effort to shutter the facility over concerns about its climate impact.",
      "The decision was hailed as a victory by Greenidge Generation, a large-scale crypto mine in the Finger Lakes region that has drawn the ire of environmental groups and watchdogs since it began mining bitcoin four years ago.",
      "Like other large-scale crypto-mining operations, Greenidge relies on thousands of electricity-guzzling computer servers that generate bitcoin by solving complex equations. To power those servers, Greenidge uses a former coal-burning plant that was converted to natural gas in 2017 after years of disuse.",
      "In 2022, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation denied a required air permit to the plant on the grounds that its greenhouse gas emissions ran afoul of the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals.",
      "In response to a lawsuit by the corporation, State Supreme Court Justice Vincent M. Dinolfo ruled Thursday that the agency had failed to give Greenidge an opportunity to justify its alleged violation, an \u201cinterpretative error\u201d under the law.",
      "\u201cTransparent political bias lost today,\u201d Greenidge said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe ruling ensures our facility will continue operating and our local employees will not have their careers ripped away by politically motivated governmental overreach that had no basis in law from the first day it began.\u201d",
      "A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, allege Greenidge is pumping millions of pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, while contaminating the nearby Seneca Lake with daily discharges of heated water required to run the plant.",
      "\u201cThe Finger Lakes community has been sounding the alarm on the disastrous impacts of this facility on their water, air, and climate,\u201d said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney in the Clean Energy Program at Earthjustice. \u201cWe will continue our fight until Greenidge shuts down for good,\u201d",
      "In rejecting the permit, the DEC said the plant had misled regulators about the true purpose of the conversion. \u201cInstead of helping to meet the current electricity needs of the state as originally described, the facility is operating primarily to meet its own significant new energy load,\u201d the agency said in its letter to the company.",
      "A spokesperson for the DEC did not respond to a request for comment about the decision.",
      "Greenidge has said it is in compliance with its permits and that the plant is 100% carbon neutral, thanks to the purchase of carbon offsets such as forestry programs and projects that capture methane from landfills.",
      "Yvonne Taylor, a vice president at Seneca Lake Guardian, said the facility was a test case for the state\u2019s ability to enforce a raft of climate laws. She worried the recent election of Donald Trump, who received billions of dollars from the crypto industry, would further weaken efforts to enforce those protections.",
      "\u201cGreenidge being permitted to continue operating flies in the face of our state climate goals and what we\u2019ve spent generations working for in our community,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not serving any public purpose or benefit other than making a few people who are already rich, richer.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Utility regulators in North Dakota have approved part of a carbon dioxide pipeline that would span five Midwestern states",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- North Dakota utility regulators granted approval on Friday for a span of a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline that would cross five Midwestern states \u2014 a key victory for the company that has faced vociferous landowner objections and various hurdles and setbacks in its plans.",
      "The state Public Service Commission voted unanimously to approve a siting permit for Summit Carbon Solutions' modified, 333-mile route in North Dakota. The company's proposed $8 billion, 2,500-mile pipeline system would carry tons of planet-warming CO2 emissions from 57 ethanol plants in five states for storage deep underground in North Dakota.",
      "No construction has begun anywhere on Summit\u2019s proposed route. Iowa has approved the project, but other hurdles remain in North Dakota as well as South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska.",
      "The approval is a win for the company after North Dakota initially denied a permit in 2023, shortly followed by rejection in South Dakota. Another company, Navigator CO2 Ventures, canceled its project around the same time due to the \u201cunpredictable nature of the regulatory and government processes involved, particularly in South Dakota and Iowa.\"",
      "Supporters cheer carbon capture projects as a way to combat climate change, with lucrative federal tax credits available for such efforts. The ethanol industry sees Summit's project opening up sustainable aviation fuel markets, a boost for ethanol and No. 1 corn producer Iowa.",
      "North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, now President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Interior Secretary, a position with wide influence over natural resources, has touted his state's underground CO2 storage potential as a \u201cgeologic jackpot.\u201d Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged.",
      "Summit opponents, including many landowners across the Midwest, decry the potential of a pipe rupture releasing hazardous, heavy CO2 gas to flow over the land, endangering people's health and lives. They also fear the taking of their land through eminent domain.",
      "North Dakota Public Service Commission Chairman Randy Christmann urged Summit not to use eminent domain, \u201cat least not more than absolutely necessary.\u201d Eminent domain is not in the panel's jurisdiction or a part of the siting process, he said.",
      "Summit CEO Lee Blank told reporters the company is pleased with the panel's decision. He said Summit has worked with landowners on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so.",
      "\u201cOur goal is, again, to acquire as much right of way possible as we can voluntarily, and ultimately at the end of the day, we hope to do 100% of that,\u201d Blank said.",
      "Summit said Friday it has acquired easements for over 82% of its North Dakota route.",
      "Republican state Sen. Jeff Magrum, an opponent whose district the pipeline would cross, said he\u2019d rather see investments in roads, bridges and dams instead of \u201cGreen New Deal projects that don\u2019t create any benefit for our state or our country.\u201d He expects the panel\u2019s decision to be challenged.",
      "In a statement, landowner attorney Brian Jorde said, \u201cNo surprise on the decision. We need to analyze the written decision. Like in Iowa, the courts will sort this out and ultimately decide if the PSC decision will stand or be reversed.\"",
      "In August, the Iowa Utilities Commission issued Summit a hazardous liquid pipeline permit after approving the company's application in June. The panel also granted Summit the right of eminent domain over numerous parcels of land.",
      "But the company cannot start construction in Iowa until it has route approvals from both Dakotas and approval for underground storage in North Dakota, among other requirements. The Iowa panel's decision sparked lawsuits in opposition.",
      "Christmann said the North Dakota permit has no restrictions based on what any other states do.",
      "The North Dakota panel had denied Summit a siting permit in August 2023. The regulators said Summit hadn't sufficiently addressed several issues, including geologic instability, wildlife areas, cultural resource impacts and some landowner concerns.",
      "Soon afterward, the panel agreed to reconsider, beginning more than a year of meetings and document filings.",
      "Summit submitted three storage facility permit applications to North Dakota\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources, but no decision has been made.",
      "In 2022, Minnkota Power Cooperative and Summit agreed to collaborate on developing CO2 storage in central North Dakota, a pact that also lets Summit use Minnkota's previously permitted 100-million-ton underground storage.",
      "In September 2023, South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission denied Summit's permit application after commission staff said the route would violate county ordinances for setback distances. Summit has said it plans to reapply this month for a permit.",
      "In a referendum earlier this month, South Dakota voters rejected a suite of regulations that opponents said would deny local control over such projects and consolidate authority with state regulators. Supporters had promoted it as a \u201clandowner bill of rights.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to decide Dec. 12 whether to approve a 28-mile segment of pipeline that would connect an ethanol plant near Fergus Falls to Summit\u2019s network in North Dakota. An administrative law judge recommended that the commissioners find that the environmental review for the Minnesota section met the legal requirements, and issue a route permit to Summit.",
      "In Nebraska, where there is no state regulatory process for CO2 pipelines, Summit is working with individual counties to advance its project. At least one county has denied a permit.",

      "This year\u2019s successful 9-1 football season for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has an unexpected player at the helm: its first Jewish quarterback",
      "PROVO, Utah -- Shortly after sunset on Saturday, Rabbi Chaim Zippel clasped an overflowing cup of wine and a tin of smelling spices as he marked the end of the Sabbath with a small Jewish congregation at his home near Provo, which doubles as the county\u2019s only synagogue.",
      "The conclusion of the ceremony known as Havdalah set off a mad dash to change into blue and white fan gear and drive to the football stadium at nearby Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Zippel never expected to become a BYU fan, or even a football follower, but that changed when the school where 98.5% of students belong to the faith known widely as the Mormon church added its first Jewish quarterback to the roster.",
      "With Jake Retzlaff at the helm, the Cougars won nine straight games in what was shaping up to be a storied season before a loss Saturday against the Kansas Jayhawks ended their undefeated run. Even so, BYU \u2014 ranked No. 14 in the AP Top 25 \u2014 could end the season at the top of the Big 12 Conference with a chance to make the College Football Playoff.",
      "Retzlaff has earned a hero\u2019s embrace by rabbis and others in Provo's tiny but tight-knit Jewish community while also becoming a favorite of the broader BYU fan base that lovingly calls him the \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "One of just three Jewish students in a student body of 35,000, the quarterback and team co-captain who worked his way into the starting lineup has used his newfound stardom to teach others about his own faith while taking steps to learn more about Judaism for himself.",
      "\u201cI came here thinking I might not fit in with the culture, so this will be a place where I can just focus on school and football,\u201d Retzlaff told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I found that, in a way, I do fit. People are curious. And when everybody around you is so faith-oriented, it makes you want to explore your faith more.\u201d",
      "The junior college transfer from Corona, California, formed a fast friendship with the Utah rabbi when he came to BYU in 2023. The two began studying Judaism fundamentals each week in the campus library, which would help Retzlaff speak confidently about his faith in public and in his many required religion classes.",
      "BYU undergraduates must take classes about the Book of Mormon, the gospel of Jesus Christ and the faith's core belief that families can be together forever if marriages are performed in temples. Retzlaff said he was surprised to find many references to the Jewish people in the Book of Mormon. Some classmates and fans have even called him \u201cthe chosen one,\u201d referring to both his success on the field and a Latter-day Saint belief that members of the Jewish faith are God\u2019s chosen people.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of respect, honestly. They're putting me on a mantel sometimes, and I'm like, \u2018Whoa guys, I don't know about that,'\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Retzlaff, 21, has embraced becoming an ambassador for his faith in college football and in a state where only 0.2% of residents are Jewish. The redshirt junior wears a silver Star of David necklace on campus and attends dinners on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, at the rabbi's house during the offseason.",
      "He led Utah County\u2019s first public Hanukkah menorah lighting last year at Provo\u2019s historic courthouse, brought a kosher food truck to a team weight training and wrapped tefillin with Zippel in the BYU stadium. The tefillin ritual performed by Jewish men involves strapping black boxes containing Torah verses to the arm and forehead as a way of connecting to God.",
      "\u201cI told Jake, I said, after doing this here, after connecting to God on your terms inside the stadium, no amount of pressure will ever get to you,\u201d Zippel said. \u201cI think there's no greater example of finding your corner of the world where you're supposed to make your impact and making that impact.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff is affiliated with the Reform denomination of Judaism, which melds Jewish tradition with modern sensibilities, often prioritizing altruistic values and personal choice over a strict interpretation of Jewish law. He plays football on Friday nights and Saturdays during Shabbat and says sports have become a way to connect with his faith and to inspire young Jewish athletes.",
      "Among them is Hunter Smith, a 14-year-old high school quarterback from Chicago who flew to Utah with his dad, brother and a group of Jewish friends to watch Retzlaff play. The brothers sported Retzlaff's No. 12 jerseys, and their father Cameron wore a \u201cBYJew\u201d T-shirt depicting Retzlaff emerging from a Star of David, the most recognizable symbol of the faith.",
      "\u201cBeing the only Jewish quarterback in my area that I know of, I feel like I get to pave my own path in a way,\" Smith said during Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cJake's the only Jewish quarterback in college football, so he\u2019s someone I can relate to and is like a role model for me, someone I can really look up to.\u201d",
      "When Retzlaff lit Provo's giant menorah last December, Zippel said he was touched to hear the quarterback speak about the importance of his visibility at a time when some Jewish students didn't feel safe expressing their religious identity on their own campuses amid heightened antisemitism in the United States.",
      "His presence has been especially impactful for BYU alumna Malka Moya, 30, who had struggled to navigate her intersecting identities on the campus as someone who is both Jewish and a Latter-day Saint.",
      "\u201cJake feels very comfortable wearing his Star of David all the time,\u201d said Moya, who lives near Provo. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been very comfortable with expressing my Jewish identity. But, more recently, I feel like if he can do it, I can do it.\u201d"

      "MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Sawyer Robertson's poise helped him set a personal best while enabling Baylor to snap a futility streak against West Virginia on the road and become bowl eligible.",
      "Robertson threw for a career-high 329 yards and three touchdowns, Bryson Washington ran for three scores and caught a TD pass, and Baylor won its fourth straight, beating West Virginia 49-35 Saturday night.",
      "Baylor (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) became bowl eligible for the third time under fifth-year coach Dave Aranda. The Bears have made quite the turnaround after starting the season 2-4 that raised questions about Aranda\u2019s job security.",
      "\u201cWinning solves a lot of things,\u201d Aranda said.",
      "Baylor is scoring an average of 46 points per game during its streak, compared with 28 over the first six games of the season.",
      "Much of that points to the leadership of Robertson, who now has 20 TD passes and just four interceptions this season.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of crazy,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt's a testament to the guys in the lockeroom, a testament to the coaches putting us players in a position to succeed. It's a really good feeling.\u201d",
      "West Virginia (5-5, 4-3) couldn\u2019t convert a pair of fourth-down opportunities in Baylor territory late in the game, including one at the 9-yard line, and saw its two-game winning streak snapped.",

      "West Virginia was driving for a go-ahead score late in the second quarter when Justin Robinson dropped a fourth-down pass inside the Baylor 30. The Bears then drove 65 yards in five plays with Robertson finding Monaray Baldwin in blown coverage for a 40-yard touchdown to put Baylor ahead to stay.",
      "Then, after a 20-yard punt out of bounds by the usually sure-footed Oliver Straw, the Bears needed just two plays to find the end zone with Washington running 51 yards untouched to put the Bears up 28-14.",
      "Washington, a redshirt freshman, finished with 123 rushing yards and has scored eight touchdowns over the past two games. He also had TD runs of 8 and 9 yards Saturday along with a 22-yard leaping catch for a score with a defender draped over him.",
      "\u201cWhen he gets going or the running backs get going, it just opens up the offense for us and the receivers,\" said Baylor wide receiver Josh Cameron. \u201dI'm super happy and just really proud of him with his journey and how far he's come.\"",

      "Jannik Sinner opened up about his ongoing doping case after beating U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday for the ATP Finals trophy before his home fans.",
      "Sinner tested positive in two separate drug tests in March and a decision to clear him of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September. A final ruling is expected from the Court of Arbitration for Sport early next year.",
      "Sinner\u2019s explanation was that the banned performance-enhancer entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who had used a spray containing the steroid to treat his own cut finger.",
      "\u201cI've kept on thinking about where we went wrong and what we could have done better,\u201d Sinner said in Italian. \u201cI had days where I wasn't feeling great; nights when I didn't sleep well.",
      "\u201cBut when I put my hat on, I don't think about what's going on beyond the court,\u201d Sinner added. \u201cI'm fortunate to have people around me who keep me stable. Thanks to them we've continued to work hard every day like there's no tomorrow and we've even improved in this period.\u201d",
      "Sinner's victory in Turin was the latest big achievement in a year full of them following his first two Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open and U.S. Open and clinching the year-end No. 1 ranking.",
      "Sinner has won 26 of his last 27 matches and ends the ATP season with eight titles and an overall record of 70-6.",

      "Sinner became the first Italian to win the finals and he went one step further than last year, when he lost the championship match to Novak Djokovic, who withdrew this time. And he did so without dropping a set \u2013 which was last accomplished by Ivan Lendl in 1986.",
      "\u201cI just tried to understand whatever works best for each opponent,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cIt was a very high-level tournament from my side. At times, I couldn\u2019t play better.\u201d",
      "The crowd inside Inalpi Arena included multiple clusters of fans wearing orange \u2014 a tribute to Sinner\u2019s red- and orange-colored hair, and how he once ate carrots during a match. There were orange carrot costumes, orange wigs, orange hats, jackets and plenty of other orange items, too.",
      "Some fans even had carrots in their mouths.",
      "The crowd broke into its customary chant of \u201cOle, Ole, Ole; Sin-ner, Sin-ner\u201d when Sinner produced a drop-shot winner to break for a 4-3 lead in the first set.",
      "Sinner faced a break point while serving for the first set but saved it with a big serve out wide that Fritz couldn\u2019t return. Then he served an ace \u2014 his 10th of the set \u2014 to close it out.",
      "Another break by Sinner early in the second and the match was virtually over.",
      "Sinner served better than he had all week, leading 14-8 in aces without any double-faults.",
      "\u201cHe served absolutely lights out. So many lines,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cHe placed the serve great. He took a lot of risk on the second serve as well. I think that was probably one of his main game plans, to not let me attack his second serve.\u201d",
      "Fritz was attempting to become the event\u2019s first American champion since Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi in the title match 25 years ago.",
      "Still, Fritz will rise to a career-high No. 4 in the rankings on Monday after beating No. 2 Alexander Zverev in a third-set tiebreaker in the semifinals on Saturday. That will make him the highest-ranked American man since Andy Roddick was No. 4 in August 2007.",

      "The Dallas Wings won the WNBA draft lottery Sunday and the chance to draft UConn star Paige Bueckers with the No. 1 pick",
      "The future of the Dallas Wings got a lot brighter as the franchise won the WNBA draft lottery on Sunday and with it the chance to draft UConn star Paige Bueckers with the No. 1 pick.",
      "\u201cWe know what No. 1 draft picks have done to franchises and in recent years how they\u2019ve changed the trajectory of teams,\u201d said Wings general manager Curt Miller, who got that job nine days ago. \u201cSo super excited to earn the No. 1 pick in 2025 draft.\u201d",
      "Miller said he answered one text message from Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in the few minutes he had between the lottery and a Zoom call with the media.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t be happier to see her excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cReally exciting times, can\u2019t wait to get off Zoom and start to connect with the players.\u201d",
      "Before Miller can figure out who the team will draft first, he has to hire a new coach for the franchise. He just started that process.",
      "\u201cThe coaching search has already generated tremendous amounts of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t begin to tell you the interest coming from not only the WNBA but also outside the WNBA. This is only going to increase it.\u201d",
      "The day didn't start out great for Miller as his flight from Los Angeles to Dallas was canceled this morning, so he had to watch the draft from a coaching friend's office in California.",
      "Bueckers, who is the consensus No. 1 pick, has had her career at UConn derailed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before getting injured her sophomore season. She is healthy now and has No. 2 UConn undefeated in the early part of the season.",
      "Dallas last had the No. 1 pick in 2021 and chose Charli Collier, who is now out of the league. That season, the Wings had the second pick in the draft before acquiring the top choice via trade. The franchise had participated in the lottery 11 times before winning it this year. The Wings had a 22.7% chance to win the lottery.",
      "The Los Angeles Sparks, who had the highest chance at 44% to get the top choice, will pick second. The Sparks chose second last year also as well as fourth in the draft.",

Our staff is already hard at work exploring all our options in the lottery and with our other three picks.\u201d",

      "Chicago, after acquiring the pick from Connecticut, will also pick 10th. Minnesota and Phoenix close out the first round. The Las Vegas Aces \u2032 first-round pick was rescinded due to violations of league rules.",
      "The Indiana Fever won the lottery the past two years and selected Aliyah Boston and Caitlin Clark \u2014 the last two Rookie of the Year winners.",
      "Other top players who could be eligible to be drafted include Kiki Iriafen of USC, Olivia Miles of Notre Dame and Lauren Betts of UCLA.",

      "Jon Jones sent Stipe Miocic into retirement with a stunning back kick to the ribs and used a series of blows to the head in the third round to retain the UFC heavyweight championship in front of President-elect Donald Trump in the main event of UFC 309...",
      "NEW YORK -- Jon Jones had just knocked the breath out of the heavyweight challenger he pummeled into retirement when UFC's greatest fighter broke out a herky-jerky dance inside the cage and dedicated the groove to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As a defeated Stipe Miocic gamely tried to recover on all fours, Jones posed and played to the packed crowd on top of the cage, and even had a gift for his favorite fan in the front row \u2014 Trump for a few moments clutched the UFC heavyweight title.",
      "Jones and Trump shook hands and capped a fight night charged with politics as much as punches inside a raucous Madison Square Garden where \u201cUSA!\u201d chants echoed through the arena.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a great American champion,\u201d Jones said inside the cage.",
      "Jones finished Miocic in the fight \u2014 and for good \u2014 with a stunning spinning back kick to the ribs and used a series of blows to the head in the third round to get the TKO win and retain the UFC heavyweight championship in front of Trump and a slew of potential administration members that helped fill the Garden.",
      "Jones dominated at UFC's fourth-highest grossing event of all time \u2014 topping $16.6 million \u2014 with Elon Musk, picked by Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, and Robert Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services in his incoming administration also in the house.",
      "\u201cI want to say a big, big thank you to President Donald Trump for being here tonight,\u201d Jones said to a roaring ovation that bled into a \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chant.",
      "Hours earlier, Trump walked out to a rousing ovation in front of 20,200 fans just before the start of the pay-per-view card and seemed to bask in the thrill of the fighters who throughout the night gave him props \u2014 including Jones.",
      "Widely considered the best fighter in the world, Jones (28-1-0; 1 NC) was the aggressor from the start and landed a series of shots to Miocic's head in the first round. Jones bloodied Miocic under his right eye and showed he had plenty of fight left in the tank.",
      "British heavyweight Tom Aspinall looms as the next challenger for Jones. Aspinall won a fight for the interim heavyweight title last November in the Garden. UFC CEO Dana White had promised Aspinall, who chatted with Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, would challenge the winner of the main event in a unification bout.",
      "\u201cAs far as my future in the octagon, I decided that maybe I will not retire,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI know that we have options.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old Miocic (20-5) failed in his bid to win the heavyweight crown for a third time and the Ohio firefighter who fought for the first time since March 2021 immediately announced his retirement.",
      "\u201cI'm done,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cI'm hanging \u2018em up. I\u2019m retiring. Thank God.\"",
      "His last fight was in front of the next president.",
      "White captioned a photo he posted on social media \u201cthe boys\u201d that featured him with Trump, Kid Rock and Musk. Trump pumped a fist during an occasional outbreak of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chants. He was flanked in his front-row seat by White on his right and Musk on his left and politely applauded the fight winners.",
      "UFC fans wore red Trump hats and some waved flags emblazoned with his image during breaks in the action.",
      "In a lightweight bout that made every fan from Kid Rock to Jordan Knight to Anthony Kiedis go wild at the finish in the fifth round, Charles Oliveira beat Michael Chandler via unanimous decision. The fight was a rematch of their May 2021 fight when Charles Oliveira topped Chandler to win the lightweight title. Oliveira staked his claim to another title fight with the win",
      "The fifth round was about as good as it gets inside the octagon highlighted by Chandler dropping Oliveira twice on his back. The 38-year-old Chandler stepped inside the cage for the first time in two years, in large part because he waited for a fight that never materialized with Conor McGregor.",
      "\u201cWe've been wondering where you've been, Conor,\u201d Chandler bellowed in the cage. \u201cCome back and beat me if you can.\u201d",
      "McGregor has been sued by a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in a Dublin hotel in 2018.",
      "Trump is tight with White, a relationship that dates to UFC\u2019s formative years before its rise into a billion-dollar promotion. New Jersey was one of the first states that embraced UFC and White has long credited fights at the Trump Taj Mahal for helping the company grow into a heavyweight in the sports world. White both spoke at Trump\u2019s request at the Republican National Convention and appeared on stage at the election party.",
      "UFC fighters spoke this week in New York with excitement about earning the chance to fight in front of Trump.",
      "\u201cTo see Dana up on stage at the election, I feel like that moment just elevated the whole sport,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAmericans, people from around the world were like, who\u2019s the bald-headed dude talking? That represents all of us.\u201d",
      "Bo Nickal topped Paul Craig by unanimous decision in a welterweight fight, then crouched to speak to Trump.",
      "\u201cI showed him my golf swing, asked him how it looked,\u201d Nickal said. \u201cHe said it needs work.\u201d",
      "Trump threw his arms open when he spotted UFC broadcaster Joe Rogan. Trump and Rogan embraced and shared a few words before the opening bout of the main card.",
      "Trump sat ahead of the election for a three-hour interview on Rogan's podcast. Rogan helped encourage on the podcast some of Trump's false claims about voting, election fraud and his loss in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Rogan endorsed Trump for president.",
      "Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also attended.",

Sideline reporter Shannon Spake asked Ball about the team\u2019s defensive strategy against Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo on the game\u2019s final play, and Ball used an anti-gay slur while delivering his answer.",
      "The league came down hard on Ball, levying the maximum fine possible on the 23-year-old.",
      "After the Hornets lost 128-114 to the unbeaten Cavaliers, Ball made his first comments since the fine was assessed.",

      "\u201cI spoke to Melo and he\u2019s obviously very apologetic. From what I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been around him, he loves everyone. He\u2019s a joy to have around the facility and it\u2019s not typically how he operates. He and I talked about the seriousness of the situation and how he needs to conduct himself going forward.\u201d",
      "Lee was confident Ball would keep his word.",
      "\u201cHe and I talked about it and he definitely said going forward, \u2018I\u2019m going to be better,\u2019 and I want to see that happen,\" Lee said. \"So for somebody to use those words and say that out of his mouth, we will make sure to hold him accountable to that.\u201d",
      "Ball had 26 points in the win over Milwaukee, including a pair of free throws with 7.3 seconds left that gave Charlotte the lead for good.",
      "Ball is averaging 29.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds in his fifth season. He was Rookie of the Year in 2020-21 and an All-Star the following season.",

      "He helped turn young women into champions and U.S. into an international power.",
      "Bela Karolyi, the charismatic if polarizing gymnastics coach who turned young women into champions and the United States into an international power in the sport, has died. He was 82.",
      "USA Gymnastics said Karolyi died Friday. No cause of death was given.",
      "Karolyi and wife Martha trained multiple Olympic gold medalists and world champions in the U.S. and Romania, including Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton.",
      "\u201cA big impact and influence on my life,\u201d Comaneci, who was just 14 when Karolyi coached her to gold for Romania at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, posted on Instagram.",
      "Yet Karolyi's strident methods sometimes came under fire, most pointedly during the height of the Larry Nassar scandal.",
      "When the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor was effectively given a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar\u2019s behavior to run unchecked for years.",
      "While the Karolyis denied responsibility \u2014 telling CNN in 2018 they were unaware of Nassar's behavior \u2014 the revelations led to them receding from the spotlight. USA Gymnastics eventually exited an agreement to continue to train at the Karolyi Ranch north of Houston, though only after American star Simone Biles took the organization to task for having them train at a site where many experienced sexual abuse.",
      "The Karolyis faded from prominence in the aftermath after spending 30-plus years as a guiding force in American gymnastics, often basking in success while brushing with controversy in equal measure.",
      "The Karolyis defected from Romania to the United States in 1981. Three years later Bela helped guide Retton \u2014 all of 16 \u2014 to the Olympic all-around title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, he memorably helped an injured Kerri Strug off the floor after Strug's vault secured the team gold for the Americans.",
      "Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics women's elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport's gold standard. It did not come without a cost. He was removed from the position after the 2000 Olympics when it became apparent his leadership style simply would not work, though he remained around the sport after Martha took over for her husband in 2001.",
      "While the Karolyis approach helped the U.S. become a superpower \u2014 an American woman has won each of the last six Olympic titles and the U.S. women earned the team gold at the 2012 and 2016 Games under Martha Karolyi's leadership \u2014 their methods came under fire.",
      "Dominique Moceanu, part of the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d team that won gold in Atlanta, talked extensively about her corrosive relationship with the Karolyis following her retirement. In her 2012 memoir, Moceanu wrote Bela Karolyi verbally abused her in front of her teammates on multiple occasions.",
      "\u201cHis harsh words and critical demeanor often weighed heavily on me,\u201d Moceanu posted on X Saturday. \u201cWhile our relationship was fraught with difficulty, some of these moments of hardship helped me forge and define my own path.\u201d",
      "Some of Karolyi's most famous students were always among his staunchest defenders. When Strug got married, she and Karolyi took a photo recreating their famous scene from the 1996 Olympics, when he carried her onto the medals podium after she vaulted on a badly sprained ankle.",
      "Being a gymnastics pied-piper was never Karolyi\u2019s intent. Born in Clug, Hungary (now Romania) on Sept. 13, 1942, he wanted to be a teacher, getting into coaching in college simply so he could spend more time with Martha.",
      "After graduating, the couple moved to a small coal-mining town in Transylvania. Looking for a way to keep their students warm and entertained during the long, harsh winters, Karolyi dragged out some old mats and he and his wife taught the children gymnastics.",
      "The students showed off their skills to their parents, and the exhibitions soon caught the eye of the Romanian government, which hired the Karolyis to coach the women\u2019s national team at a time when the sport was done almost exclusively by adult women, not young girls.",
      "Karolyi changed all that, though, bringing a team to the Montreal Olympics with only one gymnast older than 14.",
      "It was in Montreal, of course, where the world got its first real glimpse of Karolyi. When a solemn, dark-haired sprite named Nadia Comaneci enchanted the world with the first perfect 10 in Olympic history, a feat she would duplicate six times, Karolyi was there to wrap her in one of his trademark bear hugs.",
      "Romania, which had won only three bronzes in Olympic gymnastics before 1976, left Montreal with seven medals, including Comaneci\u2019s golds in the all-around, balance beam and uneven bars, and the team silver. Comaneci became an international sensation, the first person to appear on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time and Newsweek in the same week.",
      "Four years later, however, Karolyi was in disgrace.",
      "He was incensed by the judging at the Moscow Olympics, which he thought cost Comaneci a second all-around gold, and the Romanian government was horrified that he had embarrassed the Soviet hosts.",
      "\u201cSuddenly, from a position where we\u2019ve been praised and considered the foremost athletes in the country, I was stigmatized,\u201d he once said. \u201cI thought they could put me away for political misconduct.\u201d",
      "When he and Martha took the Romanian team to New York for an exhibition in March 1981, they were tipped off that they were going to be punished upon their return. Despite not speaking any English and with their then-6-year-old daughter, Andrea, still in Romania, they decided to defect.",
      "\u201cWe knew what kind of risks we were taking, because nobody was guaranteeing us anything,\u201d Martha Karolyi once said. \u201cWe started out with a suitcase and a little motel room. From there, it\u2019s gradually improved.\u201d",
      "The couple made their way to California, where they learned English by watching television and Bela did odd jobs. A chance encounter with Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner \u2014 who would later marry Comaneci \u2014 at the Los Angeles airport a few months later led to the Karolyis\u2019 first coaching job in the United States.",
      "Within a year, their daughter had arrived in the U.S. and the Karolyis had their own gym in Houston. It soon became the center of American gymnastics, turning out eight national champions in 13 years.",
      "Three years after the Karolyis left Romania, Retton became the first American to win the Olympic all-around title, scoring a perfect 10 on vault to claim gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Retton also posted the highest score in the team competition as the Americans won the silver, their first team medal since 1948.",
      "Four years later, Phoebe Mills, another Karolyi gymnast, won a bronze on balance beam. It was the first individual medal for an American woman at a non-boycotted Games. And in 1991, Kim Zmeskal \u2014 \u201cthe little Kimbo,\u201d as Bela Karolyi called her \u2014 became the first American to win the world all-around title.",
      "\u201cMy biggest contribution was giving the kids the faith that they can be the best among the best,\u201d Karolyi once said. \u201cI knew that if the Americans could understand they were not inferior ... then they can be groomed like international, highly visible athletes.\u201d",
      "But as Karolyi\u2019s resume grew, so did the criticism.",
      "Other coaches were irritated by his brash personality and ability to always find his way into the spotlight. When Retton won gold, Karolyi leaped a barrier \u2014 he had an equipment manager\u2019s credential, not a coach\u2019s \u2014 so he could scoop Retton up in a hug \u2014 right in front of the TV cameras, of course.",
      "He could be a harsh taskmaster, calling his gymnasts names, taunting them for their weight and pushing them to their limits.",
      "Even those warm embraces weren\u2019t always quite what they seemed.",
      "\u201cA lot of those big bear hugs came with the whisper of `Not so good,\u2019 in our ears,\u201d Retton wrote.",
      "Yet Retton and Comaneci remained close with Karolyi, making appearances with him at gymnastics events or sitting with him at competitions. Zmeskal had her wedding at the Karolyi ranch.",
      "Karolyi briefly retired after the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he led the Americans to their first team medal, a bronze, at a non-boycotted Olympics in 44 years. But he kept his gym and summer camps, and by 1994 was again coaching elite-level gymnasts after Zmeskal asked him to help in her attempt to make the Atlanta Games.",
      "Zmeskal didn\u2019t make the Atlanta squad. But two of Karolyi\u2019s other gymnasts, Strug and Moceanu, did, and it was Strug who provided one of the signature moments of the Olympics.",
      "The Americans went into their final event in team finals, vault, trying to hold off Russia for their first-ever title at an Olympics or world championships. Despite injuring her left ankle when she fell on her first vault attempt, Strug went ahead with her second attempt, believing \u2014 wrongly \u2014 the Americans needed her score to clinch the gold.",
      "With Karolyi shouting, \u201cYou can do it!\u201d Strug sprinted down the runway, soared high above the vault and landed on both feet \u2014 ensuring it was a clean vault \u2014 before pulling her left leg up. After saluting the judges, she fell to her knees and had to be carried off the podium. Tests would later show she had two torn ligaments in her ankle.",
      "As the rest of the Americans gathered on the podium to receive their gold medals, Karolyi carried Strug back into the arena, cradling her in his arms.",
      "But even that drew criticism. Many said Karolyi never should have encouraged Strug to vault on her injured ankle in the first place, and then should have stayed out of the spotlight rather than carrying her to the podium.",
      "\u201cBela is a very tough coach and he gets criticism for that,\u201d Strug said at the time. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it takes to become a champion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really right that everyone tries to find the faults of Bela. Anything in life, to be successful, you\u2019ve got to work really hard.\u201d",
      "The Karolyis retired again after the Atlanta Olympics. But after the U.S. women finished last in the medal round at the 1997 world championships, USA Gymnastics asked Bela Karolyi to come back.",
      "He agreed \u2014 but only if he could implement a semi-centralized training system. Rather than a patchwork system of individual coaches who had their own philosophies, Karolyi would oversee the entire U.S. program. Gymnasts could still train with their own coaches, but there would be regular national team camps to ensure they were meeting established training and performance standards.",
      "Though the idea was sound, Karolyi was not the right person to be in charge. Coaches who had been his equal chafed at his heavy-handedness, and were annoyed by his grandstanding. Gymnasts resented his bluster and demands.",
      "By the time the Americans left the Sydney Olympics, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that Karolyi needed to step away.",
      "He stepped aside and was replaced by his wife. Martha Karolyi\u2019s standards were just as high \u2014 if not higher \u2014 than her husband\u2019s, but on the surface, she was more willing to listen to other opinions.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s more diplomatic. Absolutely,\u201d Bela Karolyi said before the 2012 Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m wild. The opposite.\u201d",

      "Daniels quick-kicked on fourth-and-14 when the drive stalled at BYU\u2019s 36. His kick deflected off Evan Johnson\u2019s helmet and when Jakob Robinson dove to secure it, the ball squirted out of his arms. Quentin Skinner pounced on the loose ball at the 3 to set up the go-ahead score.",
      "\u201cWe found a way this time,\u201d Kansas coach Lance Leipold said.",
      "BYU drove to the Kansas 15 with two minutes left. The Cougars stalled on offense coming out of the two-minute timeout.

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t score in the red zone,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI feel like we struggled a little bit in practice this week in the red zone, and it carries over. You got to lock in. You got to be prepared when you come out and play a good team like Kansas.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe red seas parted,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was a busted coverage. Tua, me and him locked eyes and made the rest happen.\u201d",

In addition to the long strike to Kupp to start the second half, he hit Puka Nacua on the first play after Drake Maye's fumble set the Rams (5-5) up at the New England 12.",
      "\u201cTo be able to have two capable guys ... I think (Kupp's) influence has rubbed off on Puka,\" McVay said. \u201cThey were both great. They were instrumental in today\u2019s win.\u201d",
      "Stafford threw for 295 yards, hitting Nacua seven times for 123 yards and a score. Kyren Williams ran for 86 yards, and Michael Hoecht blocked an extra-point attempt to keep the Patriots (3-8) from making it a one-score game after they cut the deficit to 28-19 early in the fourth quarter.",
      "A false start on a fourth-and-1 with five minutes left hurt another chance to close the gap, and the Patriots settled for a field goal. New England got the ball back at its 10 with 2:14 left and one timeout, but Kamren Kinchens intercepted Maye to ice it.",
      "\u201cWe have enough talent in our locker room to be a very good football team, we\u2019ve just got to be able to put it together,\u201d Patriots coach Jerod Mayo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll grow into being able to finish and close out these games.\u201d",
      "New England trailed 14-10 after Rams kicker Joshua Karty\u2019s missed 26-yard field-goal attempt at the end of the first half. Los Angeles received the kick to start the third quarter, and on second down Stafford found Kupp near midfield; Patriots cornerback Jonathan Jones dove for the pass and missed, leaving no one between Kupp and the end zone.",
      "The Patriots drove into Los Angeles territory, with a first-and-goal from the Rams 5, but settled for a field goal. On the Rams\u2019 next possession, Stafford found Colby Parkinson in the corner of the end zone to make it 28-13.",
      "The Rams have won four of their past five games since starting the season 1-4. They have won three out of four since getting Kupp and Nacua back from injuries in Week 8.",
      "\u201cProps to Stafford and Puka and Kupp,\u201d Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \u201cThey came in and they did what they had to do.\u201d",
      "Maye threw for 282 yards and two TDs \u2014 one of them to offensive lineman Vederian Lowe \u2014 for New England (3-8), which has yet to win back-to-back games this season. The Patriots rookie also gave up a strip-sack at his 12; Stafford hit Nacua for a 12-yard touchdown on the next play to give the Rams a 14-7 lead, and they never trailed from there.",
      "The Patriots fell to 1-3 at home after going 1-7 at Gillette Stadium last season. They ran 73 plays vs. the Rams' 51 and won the time of possession 37:20 to 22:40.",
      "But a one-play touchdown drive and a two-play touchdown drive will make up for that.",
      "\u201cIt was a strange game,\u201d McVay said.",
      "Rams: Nacua needed attention after slamming into the ground on his second-quarter touchdown pass. He went to the blue medical tent briefly but remained on the sideline and took the field for the Rams\u2019 next possession.",
      "McVay said Nacua threw up when he landed on the ball. Nacua said he was just catching his breath.",
      "\u201cThey were just being cautious with him,\u201d the coach said.",
      "Patriots: CB Marcus Jones was slow to get up in the first quarter but returned to the game. \u2026 On a kickoff after a Patriots field goal, LB Curtis Jacobs didn\u2019t get up. He eventually walked off but had a head injury and did not return.",
      "Rams: Host the Eagles on Sunday.",
      "Patriots: Visit Miami on Sunday.",

      "Randle's 35 points were the most he's scored since joining the Wolves in a deal that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks and also brought Donte DiVincenzo to Minnesota.",
      "Making the moment extra special for Randle was that both of his sons were at the game. While Randle said his older son is at most games, his younger son typically isn't. But he was in the building along with 18,977 other fans to witness his dad's shot.",
      "\u201cI think this is maybe his second game he's come to. He hates them,\u201d Randle said of his 3-year-old son. \u201cFor him to be here and hit the shot in front of him is pretty cool.\u201d",

      "Darius Garland scored 25 points, Ty Jerome added 24 while starting in Mitchell's spot and the Cavs got a combined 44 points and 26 rebounds from forward Evan Mobley and center Jarrett Allen to hold off the Hornets.",

      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",

      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",

      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",

Previous studies, including data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggested the far side might also have a volcanic past. The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",

In 2020, the Chang\u2019e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA\u2019s Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",

      "The Australian government's plan to ban children from social media to protect them from harm has won almost universal political support",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn\u2019t moved first.",
      "The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14.",
      "But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week.",
      "Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the government and prime minister, they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age, they\u2019re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of their communities, it\u2019s part of work, it\u2019s part of entertainment, it\u2019s where they watch content \u2013 young people aren\u2019t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV \u2013 and so it can\u2019t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with \u201cfostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.\u201d",
      "One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator.",
      "\u201cKids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they\u2019re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there\u2019s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users\u2019 identification data instead.",
      "The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit.",
      "\u201cThe worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThey would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,\u201d he added.",
      "The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented.",
      "Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost if we don\u2019t? If we don\u2019t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?\u201d she asked.",

      "Disgruntled X users are once again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air.

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Hundreds of activists formed a human chain outside one of the main plenary halls at the United Nations climate summit on what is traditionally their biggest protest day during the two-week talks.",
      "The demonstration in Baku, Azerbaijan was echoed at sites around the world in a global \u201cday of action\u201d for climate justice that's become an annual event.",
      "Activists waved flags, snapped their fingers, and hummed and mumbled chants in a silent protest, with many covering their mouths with the word \u201cSilenced.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators held up signs calling for more money to be pledged for climate finance, which involves cash for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to climate change. It comes as negotiators at the venue try to hammer out a deal for exactly that \u2014 but progress has been slow and observers say the direction of any agreement is still unclear.",
      "Lidy Nacpil said protestors like her are \u201cnot surprised\u201d about how negotiations are going. But past wins \u2014 like a loss and damage fund that gives developing nations cash after extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change \u2014 keep organizers going, said Nacpil, a coordinator with the Asian Peoples\u2019 Movement on Debt and Development.",
      "\u201cThe role we play is to increase the pressure,\u201d she said of the action. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI think we have no option but to keep fighting ... It\u2019s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.\u201d",
      "Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. \u201cTo be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I\u2019m super excited about this,\u201d she said.",
      "Essop says she\u2019s \u201cnot very\u201d optimistic about an outcome on finance, but knows next week will be pivotal. \u201cWe can\u2019t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fight until the end.\u201d",
      "Activists in Baku were joined by protests big and small around the world.",
      "In London, hundreds of protesters marched from the British Museum to the offices of Socar, the Azerbaijan-owned oil company, before heading to the residence and office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Demonstrators with hands painted red chanted, \u201cCop29 stop the lies, greenwashing genocide\u201d and \u201ckeep it in the ground.\u201d",
      "Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impacts of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion a year or more is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own.",
      "Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly.",
      "\u201cI want to repeat our strong encouragement to all parties to make as much progress as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everyone to approach the task with urgency and determination.\u201d",
      "Diego Pacheco, a negotiator from Bolivia, said that the amount of money on the table for developing countries needs to be \u201cloud and clear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo more speeches but real money,\u201d he said.",
      "Observers were also disappointed at the pace of progress.",
      "\u201cThis has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years of attending this summit,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, of climate think tank Power Shift Africa. \"There\u2019s no clarity on the climate finance goal, the quality of the finance or how it\u2019s going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cI sense a lot of frustration, especially among the developing country blocks here,\u201d he said.",
      "Panama environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro agreed, telling The Associated Press he is \u201cnot encouraged\u201d by what he\u2019s seeing at COP29 so far.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is a lot of talk and very little action,\u201d he said, noting that Panama is among the group of countries least responsible for warming emissions but most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change-fueled disasters.",
      "\u201cWe must face these challenges with a true sense of urgency and sincerity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are dragging our feet as a planet.\u201d",

      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago.",
      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",
      "After Waymo received approval from California regulators to charge for rides 15 months ago, the company initially chose to launch its operations in San Francisco before offering a limited service in Los Angeles.",
      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",
      "Electric auto pioneer Tesla is aiming to launch a rival \u201cCybercab\u201d service by 2026, although its CEO Elon Musk said he hopes the company can get the required regulatory clearances to operate in Texas and California by next year.",
      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

    "story": [
      "It's auction time for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Details about a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month",
      "LONDON -- Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month.",
      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",

      "\"You know, if we're going after the guy that's picking tomatoes or the nurse at the local hospital and we're not going after the convicted criminal, then our government has failed us,\" Gonzales told ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an interview on \"This Week.\"",
      "Trump has promised a mass deportation operation beginning on \"day one\" of his second term, saying he would carry out these plans with the help of local law enforcement and the national guard. There are nearly 11 million people in the United States without permanent legal status, according to the Pew Research Institute and the American Immigration Center.",

      "He called for an end to division and said, \"We got to get back to everybody rowing in the same direction.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he has nominated Chris Wright, an executive of a fracking company who has fiercely criticized the existence of a climate crisis and the transition to renewable energy sources, to run the Department of Energy.",
      "\"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.",
      "The Senate must approve Wright before he can assume his role.",
      "He has had a long history in the energy industry and has been outspoken about fracking.",
      "After earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 80s, Wright worked for several energy companies, many of which focused on gas production, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Wright, who has never worked in a government position, founded the publicly traded oilfield services firm Liberty Energy in 2010, which fracks 20% of the onshore wells nationally. The $3 billion company is involved in nearly 10% of the United States' total energy production, according to Wright.",
      "Wright has made several public comments chastising efforts to fight climate change with unproven claims.",
      "\"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" Wright said in a video posted to LinkedIn last year.",
      "\"The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive opportunity squelching policies justified in the name of climate change,\" he added.",

      "However, the  Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy  says clean energy, like solar and wind, create little or no carbon emissions, the greenhouse gases responsible for human-amplified global warming.",
      "While Wright does not dispute the existence of climate change, he has argued that policies aimed at reducing the impact of climate change are misguided and alarmist, describing the terms climate crisis, energy transition, carbon pollution, clean energy and dirty energy as \"destructive deceptions\" and \"nonsense.\"",
      "Wright claims that any negative impacts of climate change are \"clearly overwhelmed by the benefits of increasing energy consumption\" and believes that extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes and floods have not increased because of climate change.",
      "His claims are contrary to the real-world data and research on these natural disasters.",
      "\"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,\" a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  said.",
      "The U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment found that human-amplified climate change is causing extreme rainfall events and extreme heat events to become more frequent and more intense.",
      "In his LinkedIn profile, Wright says he is \"all in on energy\" \u2013 including oil, natural gas, nuclear, solar, and geothermal sources \u2013 though he's sharply critical of solar or wind energy advocates who suggest those sources are better for the environment, citing the amount of energy for wind or solar farm construction.",
      "\"It would be hard to call wind or solar clean or low environmental impact with a straight face,\" Wright said last year.",
      "The World Resources Institute has said that \"renewables generate more energy than is used in their production and produce fewer emissions than other power sources over their lifetime.\"",
      "Wright also led a charge against some of the Biden administration's climate policies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule requiring companies to disclose climate-related risks. Liberty Energy successfully convinced a federal appeals court to pause the rule shortly after it was finalized earlier this year.",
      "Wright has frequently donated to Republican candidates and political action committees, including donating $228,390 to Trump's joint fundraising committee earlier this summer. Last year, Wright's total compensation as the CEO of Liberty Energy was $5.6 million, according to a recent SEC filing.",
      "Wright suggested in an interview on Bloomberg TV in July that the Trump administration would expand drilling on federal lands and make it easier to permit infrastructure like pipelines. Asked about how the Biden administration has overseen record oil production, Wright insisted that the United States needs to do more for oil and gas production.",
      "In 2023, during the Biden administration, the United States broke a record for domestic oil production. The U.S. produced more crude oil than any other country in history -- an average of 12.9 million barrels per day, according to the  U.S, Energy Information Administration .",
      "Wright has vowed to decrease energy costs for the U.S., aligning with a promise Trump frequently made on the campaign trail.",

      "Trump's pick for defense secretary has also repeatedly criticized \"woke\" policies in the Pentagon, and advocated for firing top officials in the armed forces who have backed the department's diversity efforts.",
      "\"I think they've been very clear that they're putting together some sort of panel that's going to look at generals, people who have served their nation the -- their entire lives over multiple administrations, Democrat and Republican in combat, they are now openly talking about dismissing them like some sort of kangaroo court. You can imagine the stress in the Pentagon about that, but also in the future of who we are as a military,\" Slotkin said.",
      "Slotkin did sound a more positive note about Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is Trump's pick to lead the State Department and has a more conventional background as an advocate for muscular U.S. involvement in the world.",
      "\"We're not perfect, but, man, I'd rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week. And so, I hope that despite the impulses maybe of President-elect Trump, that we have Marco Rubio as a more traditional pick who's going to understand that American role that leadership role is important,\" she said.",
      "Still, Slotkin declined to preview how she'd vote on any Cabinet nominee, despite her concern about people like Hegseth and Gabbard.",
      "\"In general, I'm a senator-elect, and advice and consent from the Senate is part of our constitutional process. So I'm going to try and meet with everybody, hear them out.

      "President-elect Donald Trump has ambitious plans to utilize U.S. federal lands for the extraction of natural resources.",
      "But Trump \u2013 who promised at the Republican National Convention in July to \"drill, baby, drill\" if he were to be reelected \u2013 may not be able to accomplish the vast majority of his plans due to existing protections and the way federal lands are defined, environmental law experts told ABC News.",
      "Trump won't be able to \"just turn on the spigot\" for new oil and gas drilling on day one of his administration, Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program, told ABC News.",
      "\"Every administration gets to the place where they have to differentiate between the rhetoric that they use in the campaign and the actual challenges when it comes to actually governing,\" Stan Meiburg, executive director of Wake Forest University's Sabin Family Center for Environment and Sustainability, told ABC News.",
      "National parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, military reservations and public-domain lands are owned and managed by the federal government.",
      "Public land is intended to be used for public benefit, but for the last century or so, that definition has sometimes been conflated to also include the extraction of natural resources, such as oil, gas, minerals and timber, according to Peter Colohan, director of federal strategies at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Federal lands are \"for the benefit and enjoyment of all people,\" Colohan told ABC News, evoking the famous phrase by former President Teddy Roosevelt that's inscribed on the arch at north entrance of Yellowstone National Park.",
      "Trump carried out what environmentalists widely regarded as an anti-environmental policy regime during his first term, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement to address climate change upon taking office in 2016 \u2013 which he has said he plans to do again, reversing President Biden's Jan. 20, 2021 action to rejoin the agreement \u2013 removing clean water and air pollution protections, and fast-tracking environmental reviews of dozens of major energy and infrastructure projects, such as drilling and fuel pipelines, which Trump has said would help boost American energy production and the economy.",
      "During his next term, Trump also has promised to drastically increase fossil fuels production in the U.S., despite the U.S. already producing and exporting a record amount of crude oil under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I think it's an absolute certainty that Trump is going to push to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 19.3 million acres in northeastern Alaska that provides critical habitat to several species, to unfettered oil drilling, as well as areas outside of the refuge along the Alaska coast,\" Kier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director for the Center for Biological Diversity, told ABC News. \"He's been gunning for that for years.\"",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment on this story.",
      "Regulatory challenges",
      "The president and the executive branch may have a \"great deal of discretion\" over control of public lands and monuments, but existing laws to protect lands like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will be difficult to overturn, Suckling said.",
      "Since the 1970s, a slew of environment regulations have been put in place to protect the U.S. landscape, such as the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, followed by the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Endangered Species Act in 1973. The Clean Air Act was established in 1963 and has been amended several times since, the first time in 1970.",
      "Because of this legal environmental infrastructure, it would be virtually impossible for Trump to easily or unilaterally change these protections, the experts said. In order for the Trump administration to overturn regulations against use of protected lands for energy production, he would have to present evidence to demonstrate that the proposed actions would not violate existing environmental laws, Suckling said.",
      "\"You have to use the best science available and if the science does not support your policy, the law is not going to permit you to do it,\" Suckling said.",
      "The day after Trump won reelection, President Joe Biden moved to narrow the scope of the lease in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, signed by Trump in 2017, to limit oil drilling. The Biden administration found \"legal deficiencies\" in the leases that would have made it possible for the Trump administration to expand fossil fuel production, Colohan said.",
      "The biggest roadblock to Trump's plans to drill on federally protected lands is whether or not those areas are actually economically competitive, compared to places where people are drilling on private land using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Meiburg said.",
      "However, most federal lands are not protected, Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice, told ABC News. For such unprotected lands, it's possible for Trump to issue an executive order to lease them for energy production. Even so, whenever a decision is being made to lease public land, \"there will be a legal battle for sure,\" Colohan said, adding that executive orders are \"more reversible\" than an existing statutory regulation.",
      "Environmental activist resistance",
      "In order for Trump to open federal land for leasing, his administration is required by law to notify the public, with environmental lawyers certain to be ready to challenge him.",
      "\"Environmental laws are carefully designed to produce a stable, democratic, scientific outcome,\" Suckling said. \"You can't just get in and jump around and do whatever you want, and that's why the United States has one of the best-protected environments \u2013 one of the cleanest, healthiest environments of any nation on earth,\"",
      "During Trump's first term, the Biological Center for Diversity sued his administration 266 times and won about 90% of those actions, Suckling said. Earthjustice filed about 200 lawsuits against the Trump administration and won about 85% of them, according to Caputo.",
      "\"We're going to have to sue their pants off every chance we get,\" the Sierra Club's Manuel said.",
      "The Trump administration will likely face opposition from other stakeholders as well, such as Native American tribes, which could be impacted should federal land be leased for energy extraction, Meiburg said.",
      "Trump's loss in the 2020 election may have been the speed bump needed to thwart his agenda for federal lands, some experts also said. Now that he's been reelected four years later, he's essentially a one-term president and many of his proposed actions could be tied up in litigation for years, Suckling said.",
      "Conversely, had Trump had eight consecutive years in office, it may have afforded him the continuity to enact more sweeping changes regarding use of federal lands, Caputo said. Should the House or Senate flip to Democratic control after the midterm elections, Trump's agenda would likely be blunted even more, Manuel said.",
      "However, it's also challenging for land managers and environmental agencies when there's constant turnover in the regulatory environment because it can slow progress for environmental protections, Colohan said.",
      "All land is under pressure \u2013 whether for development, extraction of resources, agricultural use, climate change or biodiversity loss, Colohan said. But federal lands carry the ideal of conservation for the public benefit, recreation, cultural purposes, and for climate mitigation and resilience, he added.",
      "\"Those things are the better, the longer-term benefits that come from conservation,\" Colohan said. \"And so that's really a choice that's made by every administration.\"",

      "\"The base is watching how they handle Trump's nominees,\" one Republican said.",
      "Lawmakers running for reelection loathe tough votes. And for senators up in purple states in two years, those tough votes are coming early.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is moving at a lightning pace to stock up his administration, mixing in conventional picks like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state with controversial moves like putting up Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for health and human services secretary. For frontline senators who hold the key to the next Senate majority, navigating their confirmations will be a minefield.",
      "Republicans will be defending the seats of North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, while Democrats will be working to protect Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters. Their confirmation votes for Trump's Cabinet picks offer a chance to prove bipartisan bona fides, but backing a nominee who is too controversial risks opening them up to attack in races that could be decided by razor-thin margins.",
      "\"If they're smart, then it's a major factor. The midterms are still a ways off. Generally, voters have short attention spans, and so it's debatable how much of this stuff they're going to remember. But I think it's uniquely important for people who may take heat from the right,\" said one GOP strategist.",
      "Some of Trump's nominees are not anticipated to run into significant roadblocks.",
      "Rubio has already received praise from some Democratic senators, and members of the chamber are often given some degree of deference when facing confirmation to Cabinet positions. Waltz and Ratcliffe may face tighter margins than Rubio but are also considered to be among Trump's more conventional picks.",
      "But Gaetz and Kennedy, along with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth, named to run the Pentagon, will likely enjoy no Democratic support at all. With Republicans winning a maximum of 53 Senate seats this month, that leaves their margin for error small if they hope to be confirmed.",
      "Already, Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski have sounded skeptical notes about some of Trump's choices, and other Republicans, including Tillis, have remained noncommittal.",
      "The pressure will be on for Republicans, though.",
      "Trump won a comprehensive victory, and before he announced his more controversial cabinet picks, Republicans on Capitol Hill were touting the need for unity as they prepared to take over a unified government in January.",
      "Collins is considered to be in a league of her own, sources said. A senior Republican who's likely one of the few candidates, if not the only one, who can win her state, she's expected to have especially wide latitude to oppose a candidate she deems unfit.",
      "And with a base in such lockstep with Trump, any defiance from other GOP lawmakers could trigger outrage from the famously mercurial president-elect -- fury that could in turn result in a primary challenge, and not just for swing-staters like Tillis.",
      "At the same time, supporting a controversial nominee who pushes the envelope too far once confirmed risks becoming a general election issue.",
      "\"There will be Trump voters who remember how Republican senators handle these nominations. And so, I do think that for senators who are up this cycle, the base is watching how they handle Trump's nominees,\" the Republican strategist said.",
      "\"Any of these other safe-state Republicans who are in cycle, it's within Trump's power to cause problems for them on the right, if he chooses to,\" the person added.",
      "Still, underscoring the catch-22, any votes for nominees deemed too controversial could end up in ads from their ultimate Democratic opponents labeling them a \"rubber stamp\" for Trump, the source warned.",
      "The pressure is on for House members, too.",
      "House members will not have a vote in the confirmation process, but they will inevitably field a slate of questions about nominees like Gaetz. Those running in purple districts could opt to punt, noting their lack of a vote, or they could knock the more controversial contenders, also risking blowback from Trump.",
      "\"I would try and push it to the Senate first and see if you get away with that. And if you don't get away with that, then I would strongly advise to stand by your principles and not to end up going down a path for someone else that you didn't choose for yourself,\" said William O'Reilly, a GOP strategist in New York, home to many endangered House Republicans. \"Loyalty goes so far, the public is looking for legislators that have a little bit of backbone and common sense.\"",
      "Democrats are also in a pickle of their own.",
      "Ossoff and Peters are Senate Democrats' top frontline members up in 2026. Offering support to some of Trump's picks like Rubio, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security adviser and former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, for CIA director, could bolster their bipartisan bona fides. But going too far risks turning off Democrats, a major risk when they'll need every single supporter energized in states Trump won this month.",
      "\"Waltz, Ratcliffe and Rubio, if you're Ossoff and you vote for them, independent voters see you're a straight shooter, and he can claim he's bipartisan, because he was,\" said one Georgia Democratic strategist. \"And then he says, 'look, I voted for everybody except Gabbard on his national security team.'\"",
      "To be certain, there are several other factors at play across the key midterm races. Incumbents' opponents are far from finalized, the midterms will take place almost two years after confirmation votes start in January, and some nominees might not even make it to a vote.",
      "But already, the knives are out.",
      "\"President Trump and JD Vance are going to be running the Senate,\" Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Trump ally, said on Fox Business this week. \"If you want to get in the way, fine. But we're gonna try to get you out of the Senate, too, if you try to do that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kennedy has previously falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism.",
      "With the recent pick of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the environmental attorney's views on vaccines have been thrust back into the spotlight.",
      "Kennedy has been a prominent vaccine skeptic, arguing that more research of vaccines is needed, although he has claimed in interviews that he has \"never been anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Vaccine researchers tell ABC News that his recent comments don't align with his past campaigns and that, if confirmed, he could convince vaccine-hesitant parents to not vaccinate their children.",
      "\"He's really not a vaccine skeptic; I'm a vaccine skeptic,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center, an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, told ABC News.",
      "\"Everybody who sits around the table at the FDA vaccine advisory committee is a vaccine skeptic, right? Show us the data, prove that this vaccine is safe, prove that it's effective, because then and only then will we authorize it, or recommend authorization or licensure,\" he said.",
      "Offit argued that Kennedy is a \"vaccine cynic,\" adding, \"He thinks that we're not getting the right information, that there's an unholy alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to hide the real data, and he's going to find the real data, which is utter nonsense.\"",
      "Claims that vaccines cause autism",
      "Kennedy has previously claimed that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine -- a myth that was born out of a now-debunked paper from the U.K. in 1998.",
      "The fraudulent paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license. More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said he's worried that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has spilled over into hesitancy towards childhood vaccines.",
      "There have been more measles outbreaks this year than last year and a five-fold increase in whooping cough cases this year from the year before, according to CDC data, which Hotez says is a sign that more parents may be increasingly vaccine-hesitant.",
      "According to the CDC, there have been a total of 277 measles cases reported in 30 states in 2024 -- more than four times the amount last year -- with 16 outbreaks this year compared to four outbreaks in 2023. An estimated 96% of measles cases this year were not fully vaccinated. Additionally, whooping cough cases are at the highest levels this year since 2014, according to CDC data.",
      "This comes as vaccinations among kindergarteners dipped in the 2023-2024 school year for the fourth year in a row \u2013 failing to meet the 95% threshold goal aimed to prevent a single infection from sparking an outbreak. The last time that threshold was met was pre-pandemic, during the 2019-2020 school year.",
      "\"Now you put someone like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's most prominent, well-known anti-vaccine activist at the top of the food chain, at the top of Health and Human Services,\" Hotez said. \"I don't see how these things improve any. If anything, they could start to decline even further. \u2026So, I worry about further erosion in the number of kids getting vaccinated in the U.S.\"",
      "Claims about the COVID-19 vaccine",
      "Kennedy also spread vaccine misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic including claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were trying to profit off a COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "During a December 2021 Louisiana House of Representatives meeting discussing a proposal to require schoolchildren to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy falsely called the vaccine the \"deadliest vaccine ever made.\"",
      "Health officials say COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective following clinical trials that involved tens of thousands of people, and have since helped save millions of lives.",
      "Offit says he is worried that, as the head of the HHS, Kennedy would help select directors of the CDC, FDA and the National Institutes of Health who are not qualified, and could similarly espouse vaccine-skeptic views.",
      "\"My worry is that he is not going to pick technically competent people,\" he said. \"My worry is he's going to have a role in selecting ideologues who are not well-educated about infectious diseases or vaccines, and maybe who lack government experience as well.\"",
      "Both Offit and Hotez said it will be important over the next four years for doctors to have conversations with vaccine-hesitant parents to educate them on the importance of vaccinating their children in case they are swayed by vaccine-skeptic rhetoric from Kennedy.",
      "Offit said he is already getting emails from pediatricians about parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children because of Kennedy's past comments.",
      "\"Over the last few days, I've gotten emails from pediatricians, one particularly in Connecticut that comes to mind, where they're saying, 'Parents are coming in, and they're saying they don't want to get vaccines, in part because of what [Kennedy] said. What should we do?'\" Offit said. \"So, I think that's where the rubber meets the road. It's certainly a lot more work for clinicians than it used to be.\"",

      "Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election, but scored significant downballot victories, giving them hope as they look to the future.",
      "Despite Donald Trump's more than 3-percentage point win over Vice President Kamala Harris in North Carolina, Democrats celebrated Election Day victories in races for governor, attorney general and the legislature in a closely divided state where conservatives have recently dominated the General Assembly and the courts.",
      "In an election with few bright spots for Democrats nationally, the ticket-splitting tendencies of Tar Heel state voters offered some of that good news.",
      "\u201cI think we had quality candidates running for office against right-wing extremists, and the people of North Carolina made the right choices,\u201d said Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a Harris surrogate who was once considered her potential running mate, of the downballot races.",
      "Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, easily defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to succeed Cooper, who was ineligible to run again because of term limits. The campaign was dominated by Stein\u2019s fundraising prowess and by ads and social media targeting Robinson\u2019s history of inflammatory statements on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Democrats have now won eight of the past nine gubernatorial elections in North Carolina. In contrast, Republicans have won the state in 11 of the 12 past presidential elections, with Barack Obama in 2008 the lone exception.",
      "In the race to succeed Stein as attorney general, U.S. Rep. Jeff Jackson extended a Democratic election winning streak from 1900 by defeating U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop. Democrats flipped both the lieutenant governor\u2019s office and the state school superintendent\u2019s job \u2014 defeating, in the latter race, a Republican who attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington before the attack on the U.S. Capitol and who called public schools liberal \u201cindoctrination centers.\u201d",
      "State Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, the youngest in the country at 26, is learning to embrace the positives while coping with the headwinds Harris faced at the top of the ticket.",
      "\u201cEverybody keeps calling us a bright spot,\" she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018We still lost the presidential race.\u2019\u201d",
      "State Republicans can hang their hats for 2024 success on Trump\u2019s third consecutive electoral victory and the pickup of three additional congressional seats \u2014 the result of 2023 redistricting that led Democratic incumbents not to seek reelection. Those flips were key to national Republicans' efforts to maintain U.S. House control.",
      "But in the state's lone toss-up congressional race, first-term Democratic Rep. Don Davis won narrowly. While the GOP retained a veto-proof majority in the state Senate, it will likely fall short of keeping one in the House by a single seat, giving Stein a more robust veto stamp to turn back Republican legislation.",
      "Ticket-splitting in North Carolina has gone on for decades. Voters have long been comfortable with Democrats running state agencies but less at ease with the liberal wing of the national Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cPeople are unhappy and want to see change at the federal level. They\u2019re not quite as comfortable with that idea of change for change\u2019s sake at the state level,\u201d said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh.",
      "State Republican leaders say their party still is doing well. They point to winning five of the 10 statewide executive branch positions, retaining General Assembly control and continuing recent dominance in statewide appellate court races. A pending state Supreme Court race, however, seems likely to go to a recount.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of talk about North Carolina being a purple state. You\u2019ve all heard me say this before: North Carolina is a default Republican state,\" state Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the election.",
      "Still, 2024 will be marked by missed GOP opportunities that some critics place at Robinson's feet.",
      "What was billed after the March primaries as the nation's most competitive gubernatorial race never materialized; Stein won by almost 15 percentage points. Robinson's bid was overwhelmed by Stein's 4-to-1 spending advantage through mid-October and a CNN report that said Robinson posted graphic sexual and racist statements on a porn website message board more than a decade ago.",
      "Robinson denied writing the messages and ultimately sued CNN. The case is pending. But the Republican Governors Association stopped running ads supporting him, most of his campaign staff quit and Republicans distanced themselves. That included Trump, who had endorsed Robinson before the March primaries and called him \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids\" but stopped appearing with him when Trump passed through North Carolina.",
      "Stein's campaign was comfortable enough to send $12 million late to the state Democratic Party that helped other candidates, including General Assembly hopefuls who ran advertisements linking GOP rivals to Robinson.",
      "\u201cIt could have been a historic race for the state of North Carolina, but it didn\u2019t happen,\" state House Majority Leader John Bell said in an interview. While giving credit to Stein for his campaign, Bell added, \u201cour gubernatorial candidate ran a very poor campaign.\u201d",
      "Larry Shaheen, a longtime political consultant who is now a state Republican Party fundraiser, wrote on X that without the work of party leaders \u201cthe damage to candidates due to Robinson would have been huge.\u201d",
      "Some conservatives stuck with Robinson and blamed Republican officials who gave up on him for some poor electoral results. Robinson himself complained during the campaign about politicians on his side of the aisle that \u201cwhen it gets hot in the kitchen and you turn around and look, they\u2019re not there anymore.\u201d",
      "The next major electoral test comes in 2026, when GOP U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis' seat is up for reelection. Robinson hasn\u2019t ruled out a future bid, which could include challenging Tillis in a primary. Among Democrats, Cooper hasn\u2019t publicly rejected a 2026 Senate bid, and outgoing U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, has said he was also considering one. Democrats haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina since 2008.",
      "Still, McLennan said, Democrats gave themselves something to build on.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have to feel pretty good,\" he said. \u201cBut they've still got a lot of work to do for 2026 and 2028.\u201d",
      "Clayton, the Democratic chair, said the work starts now. That means recruiting candidates, starting with next year's municipal races, making sure incumbents have the help they need, and checking in with people across the state to lay the groundwork for future elections.",
      "\u201cWe got to get back to basics,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Fmr. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who ended the Pentagon's ban on women serving in combat units, addressed Hegseth's claim that women shouldn't serve in combat.",
    "story": [
      "Leon Panetta ended the Pentagon's ban on women serving in combat units.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is among those pushing back on past comments made by President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be the next defense secretary, who was critical of women being allowed to serve in combat units.",
      "\"I'm straight up just saying, we should not have women in combat roles,\" Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee for defense secretary, said in a recent podcast interview that aired last week.",
      "\"It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,\" he said on the \"The Shawn Ryan Show\".",
      "Hegseth's comments have raised concerns among former servicemembers with first-hand experience serving in integrated units, and from the former Defense Secretary Panetta, who in 2013 lifted the Pentagon's ban on women serving in ground combat units.",
      "\"Those kinds of comments come from a past era and I think it's important for him to take the time to really look at how our military is performing in an outstanding fashion,\" Panetta told ABC News in an interview.",
      "\"We've got the best military in the world, and the reason is because we have the best fighting men and women in the world who are part of it,\" he added.",
      "\"I just think that anybody who takes the time to really look at how women are performing in combat will come around and say that that's exactly where they belong,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast interview, Hegseth said that the decision to allow women to serve in ground combat units has lowered the physical standards for those wishing to serve in those units.",
      "Panetta recalled that in the lead-up to his decision, he pushed back on the notion that allowing women to serve in combat units would lower physical standards.",
      "\"We shouldn't lower the standards. We should require that women have to meet exactly the same standards as men do, and that's what they do,\" he says he argued at the time. \"They wouldn't be in those positions if they weren't able to be able to meet the standards that are required.\"",
      "Panetta said, \"The mere fact that that has just not become an issue at all in terms of how the military has performed, is a reflection that the simple reason is because both men and women are living up to the same standards when it comes to fighting for America.\"",
      "Of the more than one million active-duty military personnel, 17.5% are women according to the Pentagon's latest statistics.",
      "The process of integrating women into combat units was a gradual one that began in 1993 when Defense Secretary Les Aspin issued an order that allowed women to fly in combat.",
      "But women were not allowed to serve in ground combat units until 2013, when Panetta rescinded the ban that was subsequently enhanced in 2015 by Defense Secretary Ash Carter who cleared the path for women to serve in the jobs that were still limited to men, including some in special operations.",
      "By 2019, more than 600 female Sailors and Marines were serving in combat arms units previously restricted to men, while more than 650 women held Army combat roles and over 1,000 had accessed Army combat specialties.",
      "Currently more than 2,500 women serve in previously closed ground combat jobs, 152 women have passed the elite Ranger School test, and 10 of them serve as Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment, according to a review of military personnel information compiled by Retired Army Col. Ellen Haring, with the Service Women's Action Network.",
      "Haring points out that the full integration of women into combat units actually occurred during President Trump's first term and that standards have never been lowered to accommodate women.",
      "\"Women have been serving in combat jobs for almost 10 years now and there is absolutely no evidence that women have harmed combat units,\" she told ABC News. \"In fact, many standards had to be established when they were considering admitting women because they had previously been loosely defined.\"",
      "\"Those who claim they have been lowered have no actual knowledge of the training requirements or how women have been held to the exact same requirements,\" she said. \"If they think standards have changed or are different for women then I challenge them to go to Fort Moore today and watch the execution of training.\"",
      "Twenty years ago, Allison Jaslow headed a convoy security unit in Iraq that regularly came under smalls arms fire and was exposed to explosions from roadside bombs.",
      "\"Women have not only been in combat for some time, but many are tougher than many of their male counterparts. Need proof? Look at the women who've graduated from Ranger School, which is so grueling that around half of the men who enter it fail out,\" said Jaslow in a statement issued in her role as the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.",
      "\"Those women deserve a Secretary of Defense who is aware of that reality and also ensures that the culture in the military embraces that reality - especially as we still continue to confront a recruitment crisis,\" she added.",
      "Garrett Jordan, a former Army captain, served in integrated combat units, and counts some of his female classmates at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as among those who are now Army Rangers or have commanded infantry and armor companies.",
      "\"Women have served in combat arms units, in both command and enlisted positions, and continue to do so and excel,\" he said.",
      "As a former Army officer, Jordan said he is \"well aware of the physical endurance, technical competence, and mental fortitude that it takes to serve in a tank unit and to perform the duties and responsibilities as a soldier in a combat arms branch.\"",
      "Jordan said women in the training classes he commanded \"maintained the standard, just as much as their male counterparts,\" he said.",
      "\"Ultimately, gender does not determine whether or not someone has the physical strength, or competency to serve in these units,\" said Jordan. \"There is a standard, and if soldiers, regardless of gender are meeting it, then they should have the opportunity to serve in these units.\"",

      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",

      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",

      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest under changes to a sweeping forest management plan that\u2019s been in place for three decades",
      "U.S. officials would allow increased logging on federal lands across the Pacific Northwest in the name of fighting wildfires and boosting rural economies under proposed changes to a sweeping forest management plan that\u2019s been in place for three decades.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service proposal, released Friday, would overhaul the Northwest Forest Plan that governs about 38,000 square miles (99,000 square kilometers) in Oregon, Washington and California.",
      "The plan was adopted in 1994 under President Bill Clinton amid pressure to curb destructive logging practices that resulted in widespread clearcuts and destroyed habitat used by spotted owls. Timber harvests dropped dramatically in subsequent years, spurring political backlash.",
      "But federal officials now say worsening wildfires due to climate change mean forests must be more actively managed to increase their resiliency. Increased logging also would provide a more predictable supply of trees for timber companies, officials said, helping rural economies that have suffered after lumber mills shut down and forestry jobs disappeared.",
      "The proposal could increase annual timber harvests by at least 33% and potentially more than 200%, according to a draft environmental study. The number of timber-related jobs would increase accordingly.",
      "Harvest volumes from the 17 national forests covered by the Northwest Forest Plan averaged about 445 million board feet annually over the past decade, according to government figures.",
      "Cutting more trees would help reduce wildfire risk and make communities safer, the study concluded. That would be accomplished in part by allowing cuts in some areas with stands of trees up to 120 years old \u2014 up from the current age threshold of 80 years.",
      "The change could help foster conditions conducive to growing larger, old growth trees that are more resistant to fire, by removing younger trees, officials said.",
      "A separate pending proposal from President Joe Biden's administration aims to increase protections nationwide for old growth trees, which play a significant role in storing climate change-inducing carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cMuch has changed in society and science since the Northwest Forest Plan was created,\u201d Jacque Buchanan, regional forester for the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Region, said in a statement. He said the proposal would help the agency adapt to shifting conditions, as global warming increases the frequency of droughts and other extreme weather events.",
      "The proposed plan also calls for closer cooperation between the Forest Service and Native American tribes to tap into tribal knowledge about forest management. Tribes were excluded when the 1994 plan was crafted.",
      "Environmentalists greeted the proposal with skepticism. The group Oregon Wild said it was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d that the Forest Service would release the proposal just ahead of a change in presidential administrations.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the Forest Service wants to abandon the fundamental purpose of the Northwest Forest Plan\u2013protecting fish and wildlife and the mature and old-growth forests they need to survive,\u201d John Persell, an attorney for the group, said in a statement.",
      "During former President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, administration officials sought to open millions of acres of West Coast forest to new logging by stripping habitat protections for the imperiled spotted owl. The move was opposed by government biologists and reversed under Biden.",
      "A draft environmental study examined several potential alternatives, including leaving the existing plan\u2019s components in place or changing them to either reduce or increase logging.",
      "A timber industry representative who co-chaired an advisory committee on the Northwest Forest Plan said the proposed plan resulted from discussions involving committee members, the Forest Service and others.",
      "\u201cWe want to see a modern approach to federal forest stewardship that protects us from catastrophic wildfires, reduces toxic smoke, meaningfully engages tribes, and delivers for our rural communities and workers,\u201d said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council.",
      "The publishing of the proposal begins a 120-day public comment period. The Forest Service's environmental review is expected to be completed by next fall and a final decision is due in early 2026."

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:14:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than a month after four towering dams on the Klamath River were demolished, hundreds of salmon made it into waters they have been cut off from for decades to spawn in cool creeks",
    "story": [
      "Less than a month after four towering dams on the Klamath River were demolished, hundreds of salmon made it into waters they have been cut off from for decades to spawn in cool creeks",
      "A giant female Chinook salmon flips on her side in the shallow water and wriggles wildly, using her tail to carve out a nest in the riverbed as her body glistens in the sunlight. In another moment, males butt into each other as they jockey for a good position to fertilize eggs.",
      "These are scenes local tribes have dreamed of seeing for decades as they fought to bring down four hydroelectric dams blocking passage for struggling salmon along more than 400 miles (644 kilometers) of the Klamath River and its tributaries along the Oregon-California border.",
      "Now, less than a month after those dams came down in the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, salmon are once more returning to spawn in cool creeks that have been cut off to them for generations. Video shot by the Yurok Tribe show that hundreds of salmon have made it to tributaries between the former Iron Gate and Copco dams, a hopeful sign for the newly freed waterway.",
      "\u201cSeeing salmon spawning above the former dams fills my heart,\u201d said Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe. \u201cOur salmon are coming home. Klamath Basin tribes fought for decades to make this day a reality because our future generations deserve to inherit a healthier river from the headwaters to the sea.\u201d",
      "The Klamath River flows from its headwaters in southern Oregon and across the mountainous forests of northern California before it reaches the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The completion of the hydroelectric dam removal project on Oct. 2 marked a major victory for local tribes. Through protests, testimony and lawsuits, the tribes showcased the environmental devastation caused by the dams, especially to salmon, which were cut off from their historic habitat and dying in alarming numbers because of poor water-quality.",
      "There have been lower concentrations of harmful algae blooms since the dam removal, Toz Soto, fisheries program manager with the Karuk Tribe, said during a press conference after the dams came down. In October, the water temperature during the day was an average of 8 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler compared to the same month over the last nine years, according to the Klamath River Renewal Corporation, the nonprofit entity created to oversee the project.",
      "\u201cAll in all, the fish that came up this year were really healthy,\u201d Soto said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see fish with bacterial infections and things like that, so water temperature\u2019s already having an impact on the fishes\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "The number of salmon that have quickly made it into previously inaccessible tributaries has also been encouraging. Experts have counted 42 redds, or salmon egg nests, and have tallied as many as 115 Chinook salmon in one day in Spencer Creek, which is above the former J.C. Boyle dam, the furthest upstream of the four removed dams, said Mark Hereford with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re showing us where the good habitat is; they\u2019re showing us where there\u2019s a lack of habitat,\u201d said Barry McCovey Jr, director of the Yurok Tribal Fisheries department. \u201cSo we can use these fish to inform us as river managers, as scientists, where restoration needs to take place.\u201d",
      "Power company PacifiCorp built the dams to generate electricity between 1918 and 1962. But the structures halted the natural flow of the waterway that was once known as the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast. They disrupted the lifecycle of the region\u2019s salmon, which spend most of their life in the Pacific Ocean but return to the chilly mountain streams to lay eggs.",
      "At the same time, the dams only produced a fraction of PacifiCorp\u2019s energy at full capacity, enough to power about 70,000 homes. They also didn\u2019t provide irrigation, drinking water or flood control, according to Klamath River Renewal Corporation.",
      "McCovey said the return of so many salmon happened faster than he had expected and makes him hopeful for the future of the river.",
      "\u201cOut of all the milestones that we\u2019ve had, this one to me is the most significant,\" he said. \u201cIt feels like catharsis. It feels like the right path.\u201d",

      "Firefighters in New York say a voluntary evacuation has helped them protect about 165 homes from a wildfire as officials in much of the Northeast cope with hundreds of brush fires in tinder-dry and windy conditions",
      "Firefighters in New York said Sunday that a voluntary evacuation overnight helped them protect more than 160 homes from a stubborn wildfire near the New Jersey border as officials in much of the Northeast coped with hundreds of brush fires in tinder-dry and windy conditions.",
      "Communities in New England dealt with a similar surge in late fall fires, and many parts of the Northeast remained under red flag alerts this weekend. Across the country, California made good progress against a 32-square-mile (83-square-kilometer) fire in Ventura County that has destroyed more than 245 structures, most of them houses. The Mountain fire was 95% contained.",
      "Windy conditions renewed a wildfire Saturday that escaped a containment line and prompted emergency officials to enact the voluntary evacuation plan affecting about 165 houses in Warwick, New York, near the New Jersey border. No structures were in danger as of Sunday afternoon as firefighters worked to tame the Jennings Creek blaze, New York Parks Department spokesman Jeff Wernick said. The voluntary evacuation will remain in place at least until Monday, Wernick said.",
      "The wildfire had burned 7 1/2 square miles (19.4 square kilometers) across the two states as of Friday and was burning primarily in New York's Sterling Forest State Park, where the visitor center, the lakefront area at Greenwood Lake and a historic furnace area remained open. Woodland activities including hunting were halted, Wernick said.",
      "It was 90% contained on the Passaic County, New Jersey, side of the border, and about 88% contained in Orange County, New York, where a state of emergency was extended on Sunday, officials said. New York Army National Guard and state police helicopters dropped water on the blaze to support ground crews' efforts.",
      "\u201cResidents in the voluntary evacuation area are asked to continue sheltering so that crews can effectively suppress the fire,\u201d according to a statement posted on Facebook by village officials in Greenwood Lake, New York, where schools will be closed on Monday. \u201cThere is currently no threat to structures but crews are actively working to ensure structure protection.\u201d",
      "The blaze claimed the life of an 18-year-old New York parks employee who died when a tree fell on him as he helped fight the fire in Sterling Forest on Nov. 9. The fire\u2019s cause remains under investigation.",
      "New York City's Fire Department is creating its first-ever brush fire task force to respond to what officials say is a historic increase in brush fires throughout the city's five boroughs, Commissioner Robert S. Tucker announced Sunday. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 14, the FDNY responded to 271 brush fires, marking the highest two-week period in New York\u2019s history.",
      "The task force will be made up of fire marshals, fire inspectors and tactical drone units in an effort to ensure rapid responses to brush fires and to help with investigations to determine their cause.",
      "\u201cDue to a significant lack of rainfall, the threat of fast-spreading brush fires fueled by dry vegetation and windy conditions have resulted in an historic increase of brush fires throughout New York City,\u201d Tucker said in a statement.",
      "In Massachusetts, which typically has about 15 wildland fires every October, there have been about 200 this year. State officials said more fires were expected because of weather conditions and dry surface fuels.",
      "The National Weather Service in Boston warned Sunday that elevated fire risk continued across southern New England, given gusty winds and dry conditions. In Connecticut, a portion of Interstate 84 in Plainville was closed briefly Sunday because of a brush fire.",
      "A volunteer firefighter in Haddam, Connecticut, was injured Saturday while fighting a fast-spreading brush fire sparked by downed power lines. The firefighter was treated at a hospital and released, according to a Facebook post by the Haddam Volunteer Fire Company.",
      "Much-needed rain was predicted for Thursday in the region.",
      "In southern New Hampshire, the fire danger risk was \u201cvery high,\u201d state officials said.",
      "The Maine Forest Service said the southern part of the state also faced high fire danger. Most of the state was abnormally dry or facing moderate drought conditions.",
      "Some relief could be in sight in New York. The National Weather Service in Albany said Sunday that most of the region could see a \u201cwidespread soaking rain\u201d of 0.5 to 1.5 inches beginning Wednesday night."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has named the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband.",
      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",
      "The five-person commission has a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump gets to appoint a new member.",
      "Carr has made appearances on Fox News Channel, including when he slammed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 appearance on \u201c Saturday Night Live\u201d the weekend before the election -- charging that the network didn\u2019t offer equal time to Trump.",
      "Also a prolific writer of op-eds, Carr wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month decrying an FCC decision to revoke a federal award for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite service, Starlink. He said the move couldn\u2019t be explained \"by any objective application of the facts, the law or sound policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left\u2019s top targets: Mr. Musk,\u201d Carr wrote."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence is facing scrutiny over her past remarks that supported Kremlin propaganda about Russia's invasion of Ukraine",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the U.S. intelligence services, in 2022 endorsed one of Russia's main justifications for invading Ukraine: the existence of dozens of U.S.-funded biolabs working on some of the world's nastiest pathogens.",
      "Moscow claimed Ukraine was using the labs to create deadly bioweapons similar to COVID-19 that could be used against Russia, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had no choice but to invade neighboring Ukraine to protect his country.",
      "In fact, the labs are public and part of an international effort to control outbreaks and stop bioweapons.",
      "Gabbard, a military veteran and a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, later said she wasn't accusing the United States or Ukraine of anything nefarious and was just voicing concerns about protecting the labs.",
      "But to critics in the U.S., including lawmakers in both parties, the comments showed a disturbing willingness to parrot Russian propaganda \u2014 a tendency that has earned Gabbard praise on Russian state TV.",
      "Gabbard's past comments supportive of Russia \u2014 as well as secret meetings with Syria's president, a close ally of Russia and Iran \u2014 are attracting fresh scrutiny from Democrats and national security analysts who fear that as Trump's director of national intelligence she could give Russia a major win, undercut Ukraine, weaken U.S. national security and endanger intelligence ties with allies.",
      "\u201cGabbard, like Gaetz, is like a hand grenade ready to explode,\u201d former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said, speaking of Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman who is Trump's pick for attorney general. \u201cRepublicans who throw themselves on those grenades for Donald Trump are risking their own personal reputations and places in history.\u201d",
      "Gabbard says American assistance for Ukraine jeopardizes global security by antagonizing Russia. She has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as corrupt and has expressed sympathy for Russia\u2019s position, given Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO, the Western military alliance.",
      "\u201cThis war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d she posted on Twitter at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.",
      "Democrats say Gabbard\u2019s comments signify a pro-Russian bent that poses a problem for U.S. national security if she is confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\u201cDo you really want her to have all of the secrets of the United States and our defense intelligence agencies when she has so clearly been in Putin\u2019s pocket?\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said on MSNBC. \u201cThat just has to be a hard no.\u201d",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the nation's intelligence agencies and act as the president's main intelligence adviser.",
      "Gabbard and the Trump transition team did not respond to questions seeking comment. She has in the past defended her actions and said her military service \u2014 she has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and deployed to Iraq and Kuwait \u2014 has made her skeptical about military interventions.",
      "Gabbard also has defended Trump's relationship with autocrats such as Putin, saying it shows Trump has \u201cthe courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort.\u201d",
      "Gabbard's own meetings with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 angered many of her then-fellow Democrats. They said her visit helped legitimize a leader accused of war crimes and who has served as a proxy and host for Russia and Iran in the Middle East.",
      "Assad welcomed Russia\u2019s military into Syria in 2015 to crush a popular uprising against him. Russian forces and Iranian-allied militias have remained, using Syria as a base for attacks on American troops and their allies. The U.S. has severed diplomatic relations with Syria and placed Assad under heavy sanctions over the brutality with which he, Russian warplanes and Iranian-allied forces crushed the uprising, leading to 500,000 deaths.",
      "Gabbard ran for president in 2020 before dropping out and endorsing Democrat Joe Biden, who defeated Trump. Two years later, she left the Democratic Party to become an independent, criticizing her former colleagues as an \u201celitist cabal of warmongers\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d ideologues.",
      "She subsequently campaigned for several high-profile Republicans, became a contributor to Fox News and started a podcast.",
      "Gabbard's remarks about Russia haven't gone unnoticed in Moscow, where state-run media have praised her and even jokingly referred to her as a Russian agent.",
      "An article published Friday in RIA Novosti, a major Russian state-controlled news agency, called Gabbard \u201csuperwoman\" and noted her past appearances on Russian TV, claiming that Ukrainian intelligence views her as \u201cprobably an agent of the Russian special services.\u201d",
      "Gabbard's stance on Russia and Syria is likely to come up during her Senate confirmation.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that while he has questions about her comments and believes Gabbard should receive the traditional background check during her confirmation process, he doesn't second-guess her loyalties.",
      "\u201cI certainly would want to ask her about that,\u201d Cornyn said of Gabbard\u2019s Russia comments. \u201cBut I have no doubt that she\u2019s a patriot. I mean, she served in the United States military and was deployed much of the time.\u201d",
      "America's allies are watching the nomination process closely, worried about how Trump's incoming administration could affect intelligence cooperation and sharing.",
      "Trump's election raises \u201cvery difficult issues\u201d for America's closest allies and members of the Five Eyes group, an intelligence-sharing coalition of the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, according to Thomas Juneau, a former strategic analyst with Canada's Department of National Defence.",
      "\u201cWill the U.S. be more selective in what it shares, to pressure allies? If yes, this will create mistrust between the U.S. and its closest partners,\u201d Juneau said. \u201cIn the long term, this would negatively affect the Five Eyes, which is an extremely close partnership premised on an extraordinarily high level of trust.\u201d",
      "Some officials in allied governments declined to speak about Gabbard and other Trump picks. Since Biden\u2019s dismal debate showing, which led to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic nominee, some key European allies said they already were scrambling to build up a security strategy less reliant on the U.S.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and other European officials underscored that publicly after the U.S. election.",

      "Murphy later served in senior leadership roles at the National Geographic Society, where he helped introduce new media technologies expanding the global reach and impact of its print and video platforms.",
      "His reporting career took him across the globe, including to Russia, China, Japan and the Middle East, Mercer University noted in a 2023 article about Murphy, who attended classes there in the 1950s. In the U.S., Murphy stressed journalism's importance for the health of the country and communities.",
      "\u201cJournalism is, in my mind, sacred,\u201d he said in an interview last year for Mercer University. \u201cIt is a sacred trust to tell the truth and to try to give people enough freedom to be able to find the truth and then to pursue it.\u201d",
      "During his time as editorial page editor at The Atlanta Constitution, Murphy became the focus of a gripping story in 1974, when he was kidnapped and held for a $700,000 ransom. The kidnapper claimed to be part of a militia group wanting to stop \u201cthe lying of leftist newspapers.\u201d",
      "Two days later, Murphy was released in a motel parking lot after the ransom was paid. Within hours of his release, his abductor was arrested at his home and the money was recovered. The man was later convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison but ultimately served nine.",
      "Murphy continued his long and successful career in journalism. Years later, Murphy gave a firsthand account of that harrowing experience in Golf Digest. It began when a man claiming he needed help donating 300,000 gallons of heating oil persuaded Murphy to ride with him to his lawyer\u2019s office to sign papers. Murphy recounted what happened once he became suspicious.",
      "\u201cHe was steering with his right hand, and with his left he leaned a handgun across his forearm, looked over, and said, \u2018Mr. Murphy, you\u2019ve been kidnapped,\u2019 Murphy wrote. \u201dHe tossed a roll of white adhesive tape onto my lap and told me to cover my eyes. With the gun pointing at me, I did as I was told and applied three strips from temple to temple.\"",
      "A few minutes later, the car stopped and the kidnapper used rope to tie his wrists behind his back and then his ankles, Murphy wrote. Still blindfolded, Murphy was told to get in the trunk.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in the trunk, he tied my wrists to my ankles behind me so that my body formed a reverse-C,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was very uncomfortable for my back. The trunk was shallow -- if I moved my head up even a few inches it hit the roof. I was breathing fast, but I was also trying to control my breath, trying not to panic.\u201d",
      "They drove for hours until he was led into a building, Murphy recounted. Before being shoved between a bed and the wall, he was allowed to speak on the phone to another editor at The Constitution, informing him he'd been kidnapped. It became national news, coming soon after Patty Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped by a far-left militant group.",
      "Murphy said he lost 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) during the ordeal and suffered claustrophobia from the hours spent in the trunk. During his captivity, he replayed in his mind rounds of golf he had shot.",
      "Two months later, Murphy said he was on a golf course at a charity event. On almost every hole spectators from the gallery asked for his autograph or to pose for a photo, he recalled. His passion for golf provided a therapeutic release from the kidnapping, his obituary said.",
      "Murphy became an active volunteer with the sport\u2019s governing body, the United States Golf Association, and served as its president in 1994 and 1995.",
      "\u201cLike so many USGA presidents before him, and since, Reg gave his time and expertise to help leave the game of golf even better,\u201d said USGA CEO Mike Whan. \u201cThe USGA, and the people who play and love the game of golf, are better off because of Reg\u2019s commitment, passion and leadership.\u201d",
      "Murphy was the son of Mae and John Lee Murphy, a schoolteacher and a store owner. He remained a strong supporter of Mercer, describing the school as \u201ca place where I learned something about the who, what, where, why and how of journalism.\u201d He served five terms on the Mercer Board of Trustees, his obituary said. Mercer honored his achievements by renaming its Center for Collaborative Journalism as the Reg Murphy Center for Collaborative Journalism."

      "If Sherrill has to resign her House seat, state law calls for the governor to set a special election if the seat opens up 70 days before the election.",

      "Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election, but scored significant downballot victories, giving them hope as they look to the future.",
      "Despite Donald Trump's more than 3-percentage point win over Vice President Kamala Harris in North Carolina, Democrats celebrated Election Day victories in races for governor, attorney general and the legislature in a closely divided state where conservatives have recently dominated the General Assembly and the courts.",
      "In an election with few bright spots for Democrats nationally, the ticket-splitting tendencies of Tar Heel state voters offered some of that good news.",
      "\u201cI think we had quality candidates running for office against right-wing extremists, and the people of North Carolina made the right choices,\u201d said Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a Harris surrogate who was once considered her potential running mate, of the downballot races.",
      "Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, easily defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to succeed Cooper, who was ineligible to run again because of term limits. The campaign was dominated by Stein\u2019s fundraising prowess and by ads and social media targeting Robinson\u2019s history of inflammatory statements on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Democrats have now won eight of the past nine gubernatorial elections in North Carolina. In contrast, Republicans have won the state in 11 of the 12 past presidential elections, with Barack Obama in 2008 the lone exception.",
      "In the race to succeed Stein as attorney general, U.S. Rep. Jeff Jackson extended a Democratic election winning streak from 1900 by defeating U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop. Democrats flipped both the lieutenant governor\u2019s office and the state school superintendent\u2019s job \u2014 defeating, in the latter race, a Republican who attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington before the attack on the U.S. Capitol and who called public schools liberal \u201cindoctrination centers.\u201d",
      "State Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, the youngest in the country at 26, is learning to embrace the positives while coping with the headwinds Harris faced at the top of the ticket.",
      "\u201cEverybody keeps calling us a bright spot,\" she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018We still lost the presidential race.\u2019\u201d",
      "State Republicans can hang their hats for 2024 success on Trump\u2019s third consecutive electoral victory and the pickup of three additional congressional seats \u2014 the result of 2023 redistricting that led Democratic incumbents not to seek reelection. Those flips were key to national Republicans' efforts to maintain U.S. House control.",
      "But in the state's lone toss-up congressional race, first-term Democratic Rep. Don Davis won narrowly. While the GOP retained a veto-proof majority in the state Senate, it will likely fall short of keeping one in the House by a single seat, giving Stein a more robust veto stamp to turn back Republican legislation.",
      "Ticket-splitting in North Carolina has gone on for decades. Voters have long been comfortable with Democrats running state agencies but less at ease with the liberal wing of the national Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cPeople are unhappy and want to see change at the federal level. They\u2019re not quite as comfortable with that idea of change for change\u2019s sake at the state level,\u201d said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh.",
      "State Republican leaders say their party still is doing well. They point to winning five of the 10 statewide executive branch positions, retaining General Assembly control and continuing recent dominance in statewide appellate court races. A pending state Supreme Court race, however, seems likely to go to a recount.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of talk about North Carolina being a purple state. You\u2019ve all heard me say this before: North Carolina is a default Republican state,\" state Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the election.",
      "Still, 2024 will be marked by missed GOP opportunities that some critics place at Robinson's feet.",
      "What was billed after the March primaries as the nation's most competitive gubernatorial race never materialized; Stein won by almost 15 percentage points. Robinson's bid was overwhelmed by Stein's 4-to-1 spending advantage through mid-October and a CNN report that said Robinson posted graphic sexual and racist statements on a porn website message board more than a decade ago.",
      "Robinson denied writing the messages and ultimately sued CNN. The case is pending. But the Republican Governors Association stopped running ads supporting him, most of his campaign staff quit and Republicans distanced themselves. That included Trump, who had endorsed Robinson before the March primaries and called him \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids\" but stopped appearing with him when Trump passed through North Carolina.",
      "Stein's campaign was comfortable enough to send $12 million late to the state Democratic Party that helped other candidates, including General Assembly hopefuls who ran advertisements linking GOP rivals to Robinson.",
      "\u201cIt could have been a historic race for the state of North Carolina, but it didn\u2019t happen,\" state House Majority Leader John Bell said in an interview. While giving credit to Stein for his campaign, Bell added, \u201cour gubernatorial candidate ran a very poor campaign.\u201d",
      "Larry Shaheen, a longtime political consultant who is now a state Republican Party fundraiser, wrote on X that without the work of party leaders \u201cthe damage to candidates due to Robinson would have been huge.\u201d",
      "Some conservatives stuck with Robinson and blamed Republican officials who gave up on him for some poor electoral results. Robinson himself complained during the campaign about politicians on his side of the aisle that \u201cwhen it gets hot in the kitchen and you turn around and look, they\u2019re not there anymore.\u201d",
      "The next major electoral test comes in 2026, when GOP U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis' seat is up for reelection. Robinson hasn\u2019t ruled out a future bid, which could include challenging Tillis in a primary. Among Democrats, Cooper hasn\u2019t publicly rejected a 2026 Senate bid, and outgoing U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, has said he was also considering one. Democrats haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina since 2008.",
      "Still, McLennan said, Democrats gave themselves something to build on.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have to feel pretty good,\" he said. \u201cBut they've still got a lot of work to do for 2026 and 2028.\u201d",
      "Clayton, the Democratic chair, said the work starts now. That means recruiting candidates, starting with next year's municipal races, making sure incumbents have the help they need, and checking in with people across the state to lay the groundwork for future elections.",
      "\u201cWe got to get back to basics,\" she said."

Selfie-seeking crowds became so thick, \u201cComedian\u201d was withdrawn from view, but three editions of it sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to Perrotin gallery.",
      "Now, the conceptual artwork has an estimated value of between $1 million and $1.5 million at Sotheby's auction on Nov. 20. Sotheby's head of contemporary art, David Galperin, calls it profound and provocative.",
      "\u201cWhat Cattelan is really doing is turning a mirror to the contemporary art world and asking questions, provoking thought about how we ascribe value to artworks, what we define as an artwork,\" Galperin said.",
      "Bidders won't be buying the same fruit that was on display in Miami. Those bananas are long gone. Sotheby\u2019s says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape.",
      "\u201cWhat you buy when you buy Cattelan\u2019s \u2018Comedian\u2019 is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,\u201d Galperin said.",
      "The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chlo\u00e9 Cooper Jones, an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context.",
      "Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where \u201cComedian\u201d was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said.",
      "If \u201cComedian\u201d is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, \u201cit\u2019s not that interesting of an idea.\u201d",
      "But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people.",
      "Cattelan is often thought of a \u201ctrickster artist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He\u2019s quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves.\u201d",
      "And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana,\u201d Cooper Jones said. If \u201cComedian\u201d is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's \u201cat least a more useful tool or it\u2019s at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cComedian\u201d hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the \u201cWater Lilies\u201d series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million.",
      "When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's \u201cNymph\u00e9as,\" Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began.",
      "\u201cNo important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,\u201d Galperin said.",

      "The lawyer for Pete Hegseth says that Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault to head off the threat of a baseless lawsuit",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault to head off the threat of a baseless lawsuit, according to Hegseth\u2019s lawyer.",
      "Hegseth was accused of sexual assault in 2017 after a speaking appearance at a Republican women\u2019s event in Monterey, California, according to a statement released by the city. No charges were filed.",
      "His lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, told The Associated Press on Sunday that the sexual encounter was consensual and that the woman who made the accusation to police several days later was the \u201caggressor.\u201d That assertion has not been confirmed in the statement released by the city.",
      "Parlatore said a payment was made to the woman as part of a confidential settlement a few years after the police investigation because Hegseth was concerned that she was prepared to file a lawsuit that he feared could have resulted in him being fired from Fox News, where he was a popular host. Parlatore would not reveal the amount of the payment.",
      "\u201cHe was falsely accused and my position is that he was the victim of blackmail,\u201d Parlatore said, calling it a case of \u201csuccessful extortion.\u201d",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported details of the payment. The newspaper also reported it obtained a copy of a memo sent to Trump's transition team this past week by a woman who said she is a friend of the accuser that details the sexual assault allegations.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team had no immediate comment Sunday on the memo.",
      "The person who reported the assault \u2014 whose name, age and sex were not released \u2014 had bruises on the right thigh, according to the city's statement. No weapons were involved in the encounter, the person told police.",
      "The incident occurred sometime between 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 7 and 7 a.m. the following morning, according to the city\u2019s statement.",
      "Hegseth was in Monterey at the time to address the California Federation of Republican Women during a banquet dinner held at the group\u2019s biennial convention, according to social media posts and promotional materials from the time.",
      "Monterey officials said they were withholding further details included in the police report because it included analysis and conclusions by law enforcement officials that are exempt from release under state public records law.",
      "At the time of the 2017 accusations, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records.",
      "After the accusations first surfaced last week, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump transition who has been named White House communications director, issued a statement saying the president-elect is \u201cnominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed. We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again,\u201d Cheung said.",

      "FERGUS FALLS, Minn. -- A criminal network stretching from India to Canada made money smuggling families seeking better lives in the United States, including a man who died holding his 3-year-old son in gusting snow and bone-chilling temperatures two years ago, federal prosecutors plan to argue at a trial starting Monday in Minnesota.",
      "Prosecutors have accused Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, of running the scheme and Steve Shand, 50, of Florida of waiting in a truck for 11 migrants, including the couple and two children who died after they tried to walk across the border to the U.S.",
      "Prosecutors say Patel recruited Shand at a casino near their homes in Deltona, Florida, just north of Orlando.",
      "Jagdish Patel, 39, died along with his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s, and with their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi and their 3-year-old son Dharmik. Patel is a common Indian surname and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel, who has pleaded not guilty, as has Shand.",
      "The family, from the village of Dingucha in Gujarat state, is believed to have spent hours wandering fields in blizzard conditions as the wind chill reached minus 36 Fahrenheit (minus 38 Celsius). Canadian authorities found the Patels\u2019 frozen bodies on the morning of Jan. 19, 2022. Jagdish Patel was holding Dharmik, who was wrapped in a blanket.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Patel and Shand were part of an operation that scouted clients in India, got them Canadian student visas, arranged transportation and smuggled them into the U.S., mostly through Washington state or Minnesota.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30. By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates there were more than 725,000 Indians living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans.",

He has faith in the justice system of his adopted country and believes that the truth will come out at the trial.\u201d Attorneys for Shand did not return messages.",
      "Court documents filed by prosecutors show Patel was in the U.S. illegally after being refused a U.S. visa at least five times.",
      "Over a five-week period, court documents say, Patel and Shand often communicated about the bitter cold as they smuggled five groups of Indians over a quiet stretch of border. One night in December 2021, Shand messaged Patel that it was \u201ccold as hell\u201d while waiting to pick up one group, the documents say.",
      "\u201cThey going to be alive when they get here?\u201d he allegedly wrote.",

      "Satveer Chaudhary is a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney who has helped migrants exploited by motel owners, many of them Gujaratis. He said smugglers and shady business interests promised many migrants an American dream that doesn\u2019t exist when they arrive.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:01:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Spray foam insulation was previously subsidised in England under the government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners with spray foam insulation are struggling to sell or remortgage as some major lenders are rejecting properties with it fitted, the BBC has found.",
      "A quarter of the UK's biggest mortgage providers will not lend against homes with spray foam in the roof, our research suggests.",
      "It is estimated as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "\"We were blissfully unaware of any issues to do with it until we put the house on the market,\" said Wendy Rowe, whose family struggled to sell her late father\u2019s home and paid thousands to have the insulation removed.",
      "Some mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fitting leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "But the Insulation Manufacturers Association said spray foam can be beneficial if properly installed, and it was worried homeowners could be needlessly driven to \"cowboy\" removals companies.",
      "Ms Rowe told the BBC that when her father Alan Chawner was offered spray foam insulation in his loft, he thought it would make his ex-council property in Leicester  warmer and cut his energy bills.",
      "As a pensioner who claimed the attendance allowance, the entire \u00a34,331 cost of the  installation was covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England until 31 March 2021.",
      "'Left high and dry'",
      "However, the work was not up to scratch, according to a report by Stephen Hodgson, the former boss of the Property Care Association (PCA) who now inspects properties with spray foam and trains surveyors.",
      "After sales stalled and difficult conversations with lenders, Ms Rowe agreed to replace the roof entirely, splitting the cost of nearly \u00a310,000 with new buyers.",
      "She said it has cost the family thousands more in surveyors' and administration fees and utility bills.",
      "The firm that installed the spray foam, SealSixty, gave the family \u00a3400 as a gesture of goodwill and said the work met all the requirements set out by the Green Homes Grant scheme at the time.",
      "Ms Rowe said that her family had been \"left high and dry\".",
      "\"It was installed under a government initiative, and you really don\u2019t expect them to turn their back,\" she said.",
      "What is spray foam insulation?",
      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "While a recent report by the Health and Safety Executive highlighted situations where using open cell was low-risk, it cautioned against applying it directly to roof tiles.",
      "Homes insulated in government scheme go mouldy",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",
      "The nature of spray foam can make it tricky for valuers acting on behalf of lenders to inspect the condition of roof timbers.",
      "When the BBC contacted the 20 largest lenders in the UK, five of them, TSB Bank, Skipton Building Society, Co-operative Bank, Principality and equity release lender Aviva - said they did not lend against properties where spray foam is found in the roof space.",
      "The Yorkshire Building Society and Metro Bank said they would not usually lend where there is a significant amount of spray foam.",
      "Equity release provider More 2 Life told the BBC it will only lend on properties with spray foam where it was fitted as part of an authorised new build and has the necessary documentation.",
      "Other lenders such as Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, the NatWest Group and Santander have said they consider applications on a case-by-case basis, and will take a valuer's report into account.",
      "They may, however, ask homeowners for documentation showing it has been installed correctly or for a specialist report to be carried out.",
      "In 2023, the PCA published an inspection protocol in a bid to help surveyors and lenders assess any potential risk in pitched roofs.",
      "But homeowners like Gary Wright feel like they have been \"left in limbo\".",
      "When his two-year fixed-rate mortgage was up for renewal, he hoped to find a better rate.",
      "But when he applied he was shocked to discover open cell spray foam had been installed in 2009. It had not come up during surveys when he had bought the house.",
      "He decided to remove most of the foam in the loft himself, after receiving several expensive quotes.",
      "A surveyor still recommended a full roof report and Mr Wright felt he had to renew his mortgage with his current lender at a less preferable rate.",
      "\"We know that in the next two years, we need to get this fixed, and I can\u2019t afford to right now,\" he said.",
      "\"This phrase 'spray foam' has created fear [among lenders] based on a lack of knowledge,\" Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, told the BBC.",
      "He suggested \"hares were set running\" by previous industry guidance that has since been withdrawn.",
      "\"Insulating is a very good thing,\" he said, adding: \"But as with any building work, it needs to be done correctly\".",
      "He said the organisation was also concerned about unregulated companies targeting older, potentially vulnerable, homeowners pushing them to pay for an overpriced removal service during cold calls.",
      "The Homeowners Alliance (HOA) does not recommend installing spray foam until issues with lenders and rogue traders are resolved.",

      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",
      "Annie Hudson, the panel's chair, said the new legislation would \"go some way towards tackling some of the systemic weaknesses that can create the conditions where very vulnerable children are abused and neglected\".",
      "Plans for children's homes register after abuse",
      "Culture of abuse found at special schools - review",
      "Assaults and neglect revealed in care homes probe",
      "Phillipson added England's care system was \"bankrupting councils, letting families down, and above all, leaving too many children feeling forgotten, powerless and invisible\".",
      "The government's other planned measures include:",
      "Strengthening the rights of families to be involved in decisions about a child going into careRequiring every council to have multi-agency child safeguarding teamsRequiring local authorities to offer support for care leavers, including helping them find accommodation, until the age of 21Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",

      "Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",
      "The BBC understands that the government will also outline action to deal with the rise in Deprivation of Liberty Orders, which have increased 12-fold in the last seven years.",
      "These court orders allow children to be locked up - in registered or unregistered homes - and are often granted for children who are a risk to themselves or others. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, says far fewer should be granted.",
      "Responding to the government's plans, the Children's Home Association (CHA), which represents providers in England and Wales, said the new Ofsted powers that will \"tackle unregistered and unregulated illegal residential provision is long overdue\".",
      "However, it argued the \"backstop\" law that threatens to cap providers' profits \"risks serious unintended consequences\" as it would \"incentivise more providers to adopt offshore interest and debt-driven business models\".",
      "The CHA also criticised Phillipson's comment that the sector was letting families down, saying it was \"not involved with families or their decisions\" and took in children \"because social work and preventative measures fail, likely due to local authorities' lack of financial resources\".",
      "Paul Carberry, chief executive of charity Action for Children, welcomed the government's plan, but said that \"urgent investment in not-for-profit and public sector provision is required to create stability and make sure every child gets the placement they need\".",

      "According to the mandate, EVs must make up 22% of a firm's car sales and 10% of their van sales this year. For every car sale that pushes it outside of that mandate, they must pay a \u00a315,000 fine.",
      "The rules get tougher every year ahead of a complete ban of new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035, though Labour said in its manifesto it would bring this forward to 2030 - reinstating the old target - as part of its wider commitments to climate change policy.",

      "In the 44 years since Beckhoff Automation opened for business, owner Hans Beckhoff says he hasn\u2019t seen an economic crisis like this one.",
      "\u201cYou can usually expect a crisis about once every five to eight years,\u201d says Mr Beckhoff. \u201cThis time it\u2019s a formidable crash, a really deep one.\u201d",
      "A German company, Beckhoff Automation makes automated control systems for a wide range of industries, including manufacturing and the energy sector.",
      "It belongs to Germany\u2019s famous Mittelstand, the often highly specialised small and medium-sized enterprises that make up 99% of German companies, provide around 59% of German jobs, and are considered the \u201chidden champions\u201d of the German economy.",
      "The Mittelstand\u2019s ability to take a long view on business performance rather than scrambling for annual dividends is part of what has made German manufacturing so robust. However, the global economy is shifting rapidly, and pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cWe're still doing well, though the economic situation has really slowed down,\" says Frederike Beckhoff, corporate development manager at Beckhoff Automation and Hans\u2019 daughter. \u201cThis year's results won't be anywhere close to what we achieved over the past three years.\u201d",
      "German firms have been hit by a number of problems in recent years. These include the steep energy price hikes that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, rising general inflation, and increased competition from China.",
      "Companies also complain about rundown German infrastructure, such as the country\u2019s much criticised rail network, bridges and roads, all three of which state-owned broadcaster Deutsche Welle describes as \u201caging and crumbling\u201d.",
      "Other businesses highlight what they see as a heavy bureaucratic burden at both national and European levels, inconsistent government decision-making from Berlin, plus higher labour costs and staff shortages.",
      "\u201cThe last three years have not been easy in Germany,\u201d says Joachim Ley, chief executive at Ziehl-Abegg, a manufacturer of ventilation, air conditioning, and engineering systems.",
      "\u201cWhat we really need is reliable [government] decision making instead of 180-degree turns. Even if you don\u2019t like decisions, you can at least plan and adjust if the decision is reliable. This back and forth is putting a lot of burden on companies in Germany.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s coalition government fell apart earlier this month, and a general election is now set for 23 February, with a confidence vote before that on 16 December.",
      "U-turns the government has made in recent years include walking back subsidy programmes for heat pumps and electric vehicles. This hit both domestic sales and net-zero targets. Berlin declined to comment.",
      "But while political flip-flopping hasn\u2019t helped German companies, many look to China as the key strain, especially on Germany\u2019s carmakers, which have been hit by two problems.",
      "Domestic demand for vehicles has cooled in China, and China now has a strong car industry of its own, with an aggressive export policy.",
      "\u201cSince the start of 2021, the Chinese export of electric vehicles has gone up by 1,150%,\u201d says Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s only EV [electric vehicles]. If you take all cars, including those running on fossil fuels, then you still get an increase of Chinese exports of 600%. During the same period, German exports increased by 60%. So there is obviously a shift in market shares happening here.\u201d",
      "The result of this is Volkswagen, Germany\u2019s largest private-sector employer, threatening domestic plant closures for the first time in its 87-year history. It could result in tens of thousands of German job losses.",
      "In October, the car manufacturer reported a 64% drop in third-quarter profits compared with a year earlier, primarily blaming a slump in demand from China, traditionally a key market for Germany\u2019s premium car brands.",
      "Mercedes-Benz reported a 54% decline over the same period, and BMW has also issued profit warnings, both also citing reduced Chinese orders.",
      "Ms Beckhoff says that carmakers and the wider German manufacturing sector need to increase their competitiveness. \u201cI really do think that productivity is something we have to take really seriously,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cThe wealth we enjoy here in most parts of Germany and Europe, we can't take it for granted.\u201d",
      "German manufacturers that require low-cost margins may struggle, says Mr Ley, but he believes there is hope for high-quality products with innovative features that rely on world-class engineering and intellectual property.",
      "Dr Klaus G\u00fcnter Deutsch, head of industrial and economic policy research at the Federation of German Industries (BDI), believes \u201cmuch will depend on whether we are able to pull the innovation levels much faster, better and more consistently across Europe\u201d.",
      "There is no doubt that job losses and restructuring on their home soil will be a painful process for German manufacturers such as Volkswagen, and chemicals firm BASF, which has also warned of cuts.",
      "However, Mr Beckhoff believes this reality check may be healthy in the longer term. \u201cI think it is good for German industry that Volkswagen is running into some problems because it will increase motivation,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s finally understood that we really have to do something. What is it that Winston Churchill said? Never waste a good crisis!\u201d",
      "So while there is hope for a positive transformation in the manufacturing sector in the longer term, the shorter-term outlook will continue to be challenging.  Whoever forms the next German government will have to make some difficult calls.",

    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",

      "Combined with a 6.7% increase in the National Living Wage and an even bigger rise for 18 to 20-year-olds, HWS expects to see its labour costs rise \u00a34m, or about 14%, next year.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:32:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Lenders have been raising the cost of fixed-rate deals creating a headache for buyers and those remortgaging.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage costs are rising - with the average rate on a two-year fixed deal now at 5.5% - despite a recent cut in interest rates.",
      "A string of lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, NatWest and Nationwide, have increased the rates charged on new fixed deals in recent days.",
      "That has created a headache for borrowers hoping costs were on a consistent downward trend, especially in light of the Bank of England cutting the benchmark interest rate earlier this month.",
      "Recent events, such as the Budget, mean that borrowing costs in general have increased, which may have a knock-on effect for those searching for a home loan.",
      "How mortgage rates affect borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move fairly closely in line with the Bank's base rate. However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.",
      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers also hope to get a place of their own with their first mortgage. All would welcome low mortgage rates.",
      "There have been two significant spikes in the last couple of years, with the average rate peaking at 6.85% in August 2023, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "Rates are lower now, but the cost of deals has been moving up either side of the Budget.",
      "The average rate on a two-year deal now stands at 5.5%, and the average on a five-year deal is 5.22%.",
      "Nearly all of the cheapest deals on the market, often for those able to offer a large deposit, have risen back above a rate of 4%.",
      "Why are interest rates down but mortgage rates up?",
      "On 7 November, the Bank of England cut the base rate - which influences the wider cost of borrowing for businesses, individuals and the government - from 5% to 4.75%.",
      "This had been widely expected, so the markets had already factored the cut into their calculations. In other words, it was so widely anticipated that borrowing costs had already been adjusted accordingly.",
      "However, the Bank of England also said that future interest rate cuts may not come as often and as quickly as previously thought.",
      "In the words of one mortgage broker, that was because the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"threw a spanner in the works\". Spending pledges risked inflating some prices, something high interest rates are designed to control.",
      "Bank governor Andrew Bailey said rates were likely to \"continue to fall gradually from here\u201d, but cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d.",
      "Lenders price their mortgages not only on where interest rates are at any one time but where they, and the financial markets, expect them to be in the future.",
      "Brokers say the outlook had changed for lenders given the Bank's latest view on interest rates, prompting the most recent mortgage rate moves.",
      "\u201cThe slew of rate changes in recent weeks has continued to push [mortgage] rates higher, reflecting the higher costs for lenders, as the market outlook for rates has edged toward a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 expectation,\" said David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"Unwelcome as it is for borrowers, it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no sign of rates skyrocketing as they have in recent years. The Bank of England base rate is still expected to fall over time, but markets are questioning if the pace will be as rapid.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesman said that the Budget was \"putting the public finances on a sustainable path\" and that was \"essential to ensuring steady mortgage rates for all homeowners\".",
      "What goes up might come down",
      "The general trend of interest rates is expected to be down, but timing can be tough for borrowers.",
      "That is made harder because mortgage deals currently have a relatively short shelf-life, owing to the uncertainty.",
      "\"Any stand out best-buy deals are not lasting very long,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "\"If your mortgage is due for renewal and you are sticking with your existing lender, you need to keep an eye on the rates because the lenders don\u2019t tend to tell borrowers when they are going up.\"",
      "Ways to make your mortgage more affordable",
      "Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later.Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house.Extend the life of your mortgage. The typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available.",

      "The number of households on social tariffs has risen by a fifth since last year to a record 1.6 million. Spending on them rose by a quarter, according to CCW data.",
      "It said the increase was down to companies doing more to promote their support schemes, data sharing between the government and councils helping to identify customers in need, and the cost of living leading to more households seeking help.",

      "What did Paula Vennells know about IT problems?",
      "Paula Vennells was the chief executive of the Post Office from 2012 to 2019. Her appearance before the inquiry, over three days in May, was hotly anticipated.",
      "The key questions were: what did she know about problems with Horizon, and when did she find out about them?",
      "In the end, we got plenty of tears, as she appeared to repeatedly wilt under probing questioning, but few concrete answers. There was a great deal she claimed she couldn\u2019t remember, and even more she said she had never been told.",

Former Minster Jo Swinson told the inquiry she has since found out what was really happening during her time in power and realised it was \u201cactually the opposite of what I was being told\u201d.",

      "Behind them, a further three rows were also packed with lawyers, tapping on laptops and scribbling in notebooks. Such an army obviously does not come cheap.",
      "Remarkably they all agree on one basic fact - the Rosebank oil field in the Atlantic and the Jackdaw gas development in the North Sea were approved unlawfully.",
      "However, the lawyers disagree sharply about what, if anything, should be done about it.",
      "Jackdaw gas field given go-ahead by regulators",
      "Rosebank oil field given go-ahead by regulators",
      "The person who must decide is Andrew Stewart, better known by his judicial title, Lord Ericht, who is presiding over this judicial review of the UK government's decisions to approve the fields.",
      "The previous Conservative administration and the oil and gas regulator consented to Jackdaw in summer 2022, with its owner Shell saying the field would be able to provide gas to 1.4 million British homes.",
      "Rosebank, located west of Shetland and estimated to contain between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil, was given the green light the following autumn.",
      "Operated by Norwegian state energy giant Equinor and Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy, it is believed to be the largest untapped field in UK waters and its oil is to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland.",
      "Among many other requirements, consent was granted on the basis of environmental impact statements submitted by the companies.",
      "As was standard practice at the time, these assessed the climate impact of emissions caused by the process of extracting oil and gas but did not assess the impact of the greenhouse gases which would be released when the fossil fuels were eventually burned, known as downstream emissions.",
      "Consent in hand, the owners of the fields raced ahead with work to get ready for drilling, striking deals with suppliers and hiring staff.",
      "All week the court has heard repeated references to the vast sums of money that are being spent on the two projects.",
      "Counsel for Equinor said it was investing \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank, providing employment for 4,000 people.",
      "Shell's lawyer said it was investing \u00a31.1bn in the Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea, employing \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025.",
      "Production is scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27.",
      "But this June a victory for climate campaigners in the UK Supreme Court sent a shiver through all three firms and the wider industry.",
      "In Finch v Surrey County Council, which involved a dispute about drilling oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the court ruled that an environmental impact assessment must include downstream emissions.",
      "'Simply lost a bet'",
      "On the eve of the judicial review, Sarah Finch, the environmental campaigner after whom the Surrey case is named, told me that \"the exact same thing happened at Rosebank.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was granted permission with no assessment of the impact of burning the oil or gas to come out of it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo, a much bigger site, but exactly the same argument.\"",
      "The three companies involved in the Court of Session accept the Finch ruling means that, in retrospect, their licences were granted unlawfully.",
      "However, they insist they provided all the environmental information required at the time of their applications; they were told by the industry regulator not to assess downstream emissions; and they should not be \"punished\" for a Supreme Court decision which they say they could not have foreseen.",
      "Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\"",
      "The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea.",
      "They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted  with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.",
      "Both groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed.",
      "Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change.",
      "Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all.",
      "If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter.",
      "At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away.",
      "After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank.",
      "It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry.",
      "As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue.",
      "Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported.",
      "\"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me.",
      "In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector.",
      "Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.",
      "Now, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht.",

      "The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months.",

      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she is \"not satisfied\" by the latest growth figures, which were weaker than expected.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy barely grew between July and September, with uncertainty about the Budget being blamed for the weak growth.",
      "The economy slowed over the three-month period, growing by just 0.1%, and shrank during September itself.",
      "Labour made boosting economic growth its top priority when it came into power but Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was \"not satisfied\" with these latest figures which cover the first three months of the new government.",
      "However, many businesses have criticised tax rises in the Budget which they say will lead to higher prices and fewer new jobs.",
      "Major companies, including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and JD Sports have hinted they will increase prices because of the changes.",
      "The latest growth figure was weaker than expected and was a sharp slowdown from the 0.5% growth seen in the April to June period.",
      "A number of economists said concerns about what October's Budget would contain had affected how firms and households had behaved.",
      "Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI business group, said firms had widely reported \"a slowdown in decision making\" prior to the Budget. He added that once it had been announced it had \"set off warning lights for business\".",
      "The increase in National Insurance Contributions for firms together with other measures such as the rise in the minimum wage \"is expected to trigger a more cautious approach to pay, hiring and investment\", Mr Jones said.",
      "\"The economy has a bit less momentum than we previously thought, and it\u2019s striking that the economy has only grown in two of the past six months,\" said Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics.",
      "However, she added \"this doesn\u2019t mean the UK is on the cusp of another recession\".",
      "When the economy is growing steadily, people tend to spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.",
      "'It felt like people were holding back'",
      "Andy Crisp, manager of pasta and pizza restaurant Vapiano in Manchester, said he had noticed a slight slowdown in the run up to Reeves' Budget.",
      "The summer was \u201ca game of two halves\u201d, he said, which finished quite strongly with sales up between 2-3% from a year ago.",
      "However, the week before the Budget he \u201cdid see a downturn\u201d in footfall.",
      "\u201cThe only thing we could potentially put that down to was it felt like there was a nervousness prior to the Budget coming out as to \u2018what does it mean to me? What does it mean to the general public?\u2019",
      "\"So it almost felt like people were holding back to find out what the end result was going to be.\u201d",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "JD Sports boss warns prices will rise due to Budget",
      "Speaking to the BBC, the chancellor said growth was the \"number one mission\" of the government, and she wanted \"growth to be stronger and to be felt by families across the United Kingdom\".",
      "Reeves had been accused of talking down the economy ahead of the Budget, but asked if her comments had affected spirits, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had barely any growth in the UK economy for more than a decade now.\u201d",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said growth had now \"slowed significantly\" due to Labour's policies.",
      "\u201cLabour made a lot of promises about growth in the election, they need to act now before their broken promises lead to yet more tax rises.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper called the growth figures \"disappointing\", adding tax rises announced in the Budget \"could be the final nail in the coffin for the many small businesses that are already struggling\".",
      "The government wants the UK to be the fastest growing economy among the G7 group of rich nations.",
      "For the July to September period, the UK currently ranks fifth in the G7, behind the US, France Germany and Japan, but above Italy. Canada has yet to publish its growth figure.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said growth in the UK was \"subdued across most industries\" in the latest quarter.",
      "One big factor was the slowdown in the services sector - which dominates the UK economy and covers businesses such as shops, bars and restaurants.",
      "The sector grew by just 0.1% over the three months, and saw no growth at all in September.",
      "In October, Reeves presented what she called a \"Budget for growth\".",
      "But the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the Budget would only \u201ctemporarily boost\u201d the UK and the size of the economy would be \"largely unchanged in five years\" compared with its previous estimate.",
      "The UK faces another potential challenge to growth if US President-elect Donald Trump goes ahead with plans to impose a blanket 20% tariff on all imports into the US.",
      "Analysis by the University of Sussex's Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy has suggested such a move could hit UK exports by \u00a322bn.",
      "The chancellor told the BBC she was \u201clooking forward to working closely\u201d with Donald Trump but would \u201cmake the case for free and open trade which benefits both of our economies\u201d."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:38:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A new China-backed megaport in Peru may create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",

      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",

      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",

      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",

    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",
      "Annie Hudson, the panel's chair, said the new legislation would \"go some way towards tackling some of the systemic weaknesses that can create the conditions where very vulnerable children are abused and neglected\".",

      "These court orders allow children to be locked up - in registered or unregistered homes - and are often granted for children who are a risk to themselves or others. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, says far fewer should be granted.",
      "Responding to the government's plans, the Children's Home Association (CHA), which represents providers in England and Wales, said the new Ofsted powers that will \"tackle unregistered and unregulated illegal residential provision is long overdue\".",
      "However, it argued the \"backstop\" law that threatens to cap providers' profits \"risks serious unintended consequences\" as it would \"incentivise more providers to adopt offshore interest and debt-driven business models\".",
      "The CHA also criticised Phillipson's comment that the sector was letting families down, saying it was \"not involved with families or their decisions\" and took in children \"because social work and preventative measures fail, likely due to local authorities' lack of financial resources\".",

      "Universities that traditionally required higher entry grades have fared better, because they have simply taken a bigger share by accepting some students with lower results.",

      "Prof David Maguire, the vice chancellor, says \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d have led to a 20% reduction in the number of courses, increased lecture group sizes, less one-to-one contact between academics and students, and fewer staff in student support including in mental health and counselling.",
      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",
      "Prof Maguire says universities need to know what tuition fees or direct funding they will get through to the next election.",

      "As universities cut back there is a risk to the student experience - this year the largest annual study of undergraduates found only 36% in England thought their course was good or very good value for money.",
      "Sir David says he expects \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d about what students are getting in return for fees, whether on contact hours or important services such as mental health support.",

      "The heat is now on universities to bring down costs, with renewed scrutiny from ministers and the regulator over how they spend money.",

      "But the singer, who quit the band in 1995, took issue with the assertions, posting a lengthy message on Instagram on Sunday.",
      "BBC News has approached Martin-Smith for a comment.",
      "In the documentary, Martin-Smith said Williams had made him out to be \"evil\" and had blamed him for some of his behaviour, including his drug-taking.",

      "\"My response to the warped world that surrounded me is solely my own. How I chose to self-medicate is and was something that I will be monitoring and dealing with for the whole of my life.",

      "\"That was the last time I saw you. I hope I have more grace and understanding when and if any of my own four children at such a vulnerable age behave in the same manner.\"",
      "Williams, who has since forged a successful solo career, also used his post to speak more generally about the pressures of being in a boyband.",
      "\"Nearly all members of boybands it seems have at some point a mental breakdown,\" he said.",
      "\"Your young charge at this time in his life was experiencing his first. You didn't excel in man management and it was here that, instead of a stern word and a pointed finger, an arm around the shoulder and a kind word would have been the best tact.\"",
      "He added: \u201cIf you are following the story closely, you can\u2019t help but notice a pattern emerge. Boys join a boyband. The band becomes huge. Boys get sick.",
      "\"Some are fortunate through a series of self-examinations and help to overcome their experience. Some never quite manage to untangle the mess of the wreckage of the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not breaking anyone\u2019s anonymity by sharing the side effects of boyband dysphoria that relate to just us lads.\"",
      "He outlined the struggles his bandmates have had in the past, including Gary Barlow's battles with an eating disorder and Mark Owen's struggles with alcohol abuse.",
      "Returning to his former manager, he told him he had \"deep admiration\" for his work and his ability to take big risks.",
      "But he added: \u201cNige, you continue to not come across as a relatable character and could do with a glow-up where redeemable features are concerned. Therefore you play into the narrative you don\u2019t want for yourself.\u201d",
      "He went on to urge Martin-Smith to take accountability and to \"admit your shortcomings\".",
      "The documentary, which reaches its conclusion this week, focuses on some of the biggest boybands to grace the charts during the 1990s and early 2000s."

      "In the bout, which took place at the AT&T Stadium in Texas, former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58, was beaten by YouTuber-turned-fighter Paul, 27.",
      "The fight attracted a huge amount of media coverage. Tyson is one of the most famous boxers on the planet, while Paul drew in a younger audience.",
      "There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj.",
      "Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated \"60 million households\" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week.",
      "But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.",
      "The fight was \"unwatchable,\" wrote one X user. Another said she was \"furious\", while a third complained he \"did an all-nighter for nothing\".",

      "\"I knew I had a good connection, so then I looked on social media and saw others were also experiencing issues,\" he said.",

      "\"Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage.",
      "\"As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast.\"",

    "story": [
      "US singer-songwriter SZA says she was \"scared\" and \"freaked out\" during her headline set at Glastonbury festival in June.",
      "The star's performance was beset by technical issues, which left her voice muffled and distorted for at least 30 minutes.",
      "She also drew a noticeably smaller crowd than the weekend's other performers, which led to some comments online questioning her suitability as a headline act.",
      "Reflecting on the show, the star told British Vogue: \u201cI just felt like nothing I could do would be enough for Glastonbury, no matter what I did.\"",
      "\"It scared me. I was like, well, I wish I wasn\u2019t doing it, but I couldn\u2019t walk away from it.\"",
      "The singer said she had also felt pressure as the \"second black woman in history\" to headline the festival (Beyonc\u00e9 was the first in 2011, although Skin from the band Skunk Anansie also has a claim to the title, after headlining in 1999).",

      "Despite a low turn-out, SZA's Glastonbury set was well-received. Highly theatrical, it saw the 35-year-old perform inside a mossy grotto, singing on top of a giant mechanical beetle and ascending a tree trunk in fairy wings.",
      "In a five star review, the Guardian called the show \"peculiar\" but \"hugely rewarding\".",
      "Highlighting the star's intricate choreography, the Independent, awarded four stars, saying \"melancholy, oddly intimate\" performance \"frequently leaves you breathless.\"",

      "The singer, whose real name is Sol\u00e1na Imani Rowe, told Vogue it had been difficult to see the audience, which made her feel \"freaked out\" and like she was \"drowning on stage\" as well as \"failing\".",

    "summary": "Prince Harry and former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson are the two remaining claimants suing News Group Newspapers.",
    "story": [
      "The Duke of Sussex is \"one of two claimants\" continuing claims against the publisher of The Sun over allegations of unlawful information gathering, his barrister told the High Court.",
      "Former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson is also continuing his claim against News Group Newspapers (NGN), the court heard on Friday, after 39 cases were settled since a previous hearing in July.",
      "Both cases are expected to go to trial in January 2025, with the 40-year-old prince alleging  journalists and private investigators working for NGN - which also published the now defunct News of the World - targeted him.",
      "NGN has previously denied unlawful activity happened at The Sun.",
      "Both sides returned to court to ask a judge to rule on preliminary issues ahead of the 2025 trial - including whether Prince Harry could be allowed access to emails sent between former NGN executives and members of the Royal Household between 2013 and 2019.",
      "His barrister, David Sherborne, said the emails were sent between five accounts of NGN employees and five employees of the Royal Household, who were \"involved in Royal Communications and the private secretaries to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\".",
      "Mr Sherborne said the emails would be \"highly relevant in terms of providing the full picture not only as to the actual knowledge of the claimant but also as to the position in relation to constructive knowledge, based on what the Palace was being told by NGN\".",
      "Some of the emails had already been provided by former News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks last year, the court heard, but Mr Sherborne said that these had been \"cherry-picked\".",
      "These included discussions between NGN and the Royal Household before Harry began legal action in 2019, and conversations about a possible apology being made by the publisher.",
      "Anthony Hudson KC, for NGN, opposed the bid, saying the emails were \"not relevant to the pleaded issues\" in the prince's case and were \"not necessary to ensure a fair trial will take place\".",
      "He added that \"extracting\" the emails would cost \u00a317,000.",
      "In a ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said there was a \"degree of speculation whether any of the documents sought are going to assist the claimant's case\", but ultimately ruled there was \"sufficient justification\" for a limited number of emails to be provided.",
      "He said: \"In all the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that there is a limited category of documents where despite the element of delay, and despite the relative lateness of the application, there is a credible case for saying a full picture is necessary in the interest of justice.",
      "\"I will, however, limit the documents that are being sought,\" the judge added.",
      "The judge also added it was \"unsatisfactory that so little progress has been made\" and that there needs to be \"further work done on both sides\".",
      "The court heard the trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, and a further hearing is due to be held in December.",
      "Others who have settled their claims in recent years include actress Sienna Miller, ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, and actor Hugh Grant.",
      "Grant previously claimed journalists had used private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house - NGN denied the claims against it. He said in April that he \"did not want to accept\" the \"enormous sum of money\" he had been offered to settle but a trial was likely to prove \"very expensive\".",
      "A spokesperson for NGN said it published an apology in 2011 to \"victims of voicemail interception by the News of the World\", adding that the company had \"publicly committed to paying financial compensation\" and had since \"paid settlements to those with proper claims\".",
      "They added: \"It is common practice, and indeed encouraged in litigation, to seek to settle claims outside court where both parties agree without the cost of a trial.\""

      "\"I feel different, I feel new and alive in these clothes, in a way that I\u2019ve never felt before,\" Ms Chola tells the BBC. \"I feel like I can conquer the world!\"",
      "The fortnightly Granny Series was created in 2023 by her granddaughter Diana Kaumba, a stylist who is based in New York City.",
      "She came up with the idea when she was visiting Zambia to mark the second anniversary of the death of her father - the person she says inspired her passion for fashion because he always dressed well.",
      "During that visit Ms Kaumba had not worn all her carefully curated outfits, so she asked her grandmother - or \"Mbuya\" in the Bemba language - if she wanted to try them on.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t doing anything at the time, so I just said: 'OK. If that\u2019s what you want to do let\u2019s do it - why not?'\" Ms Chola said.",
      "\"You will miss me when I die and at least this way you will be remembering me.\"",

      "\"I thought it would be nice to dress up Mbuya in high fashion and then take photographs of her in her natural habitat,\" Ms Kaumba tells the BBC.",
      "That natural habitat is a farm in the village of 10 Miles, just north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.",
      "Most often Ms Chola is photographed in all her glamour outside - often sitting on an elegant wooden chair or lounging on a leather sofa.",
      "In the background are exposed brick buildings with corrugated iron roofs, ploughed fields, mango trees and maize crops.",

      "\"My mind was blown. The comments were flying in and people were asking for more.\"",
      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",
      "\"It surprised me to hear that so many people around the world love me,\" Ms Chola says - who does not know her exact age because she does not have a birth certificate.",

      "To a blue, black and green sequined top, complete with a golden snake necklace and bracelet.",

      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",
      "That influence has come directly from her grandmother, who has \"always been a lover of pearls and bangles\".",
      "In one particularly playful scene called GOAT - short for greatest of all time - Ms Chola appears with a goat - that is decked out in Mbuya\u2019s beloved pearls.",
      "Other accessories also reflect Chola\u2019s personality and story.",
      "In some shots Mbuya is holding the beloved radio that she carries around all day and takes to bed with her.",
      "Or she\u2019s clutching an \"ibende\" - a long wooden stick that over the years she has used to pound millet or cassava or maize.",
      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",
      "Ms Kaumba hopes that the Granny Series will highlight that older people still have a lot to offer - and making memories together is an important way to \"leave footprints for the next generation\".",

      "She urges people to \"always forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you made. You can never change your past - but you can change your future\".",
      "The photo shoots have brought granddaughter and grandmother closer - and through their special bond Ms Kaumba has learnt so much more about her Mbuya\u2019s often difficult life.",
      "Ms Chola was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 or 13 and then, because of economic reasons, was forced to marry a man in his 30s.",

      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",

      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",

      "Miles Mitchell, a 20-year-old student, picked up the prize for the best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike last month at the competition that set this trend alight.",

    "title": "Glastonbury 2025: 11 tips for getting festival tickets",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "READ NEXT: Glastonbury 2025 tickets go on sale",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children aged 12 and under go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "title": "The 'bonkers' Selena Gomez musical which caused a stir at Cannes",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 09:10:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The singer and actress stars in Emilia P\u00e9rez, a new Netflix musical which has been tipped for awards.",
    "story": [
      "When Emilia P\u00e9rez premiered earlier this year, it became one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival, where its four lead stars jointly won best actress.",
      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:58:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Around 630,000 women are waiting for gynaecology appointments as waiting lists double in four years.",
    "story": [
      "Waiting lists for gynaecology appointments across the UK have more than doubled since February 2020, BBC research reveals.",
      "Records show around three-quarters of a million (755,046) women's health appointments are waiting to happen - up from 360,400 just before the pandemic.",
      "This would suggest around 630,000 people - at the very least - are on the list to be seen for problems that range from fibroids and endometriosis to incontinence and menopause care.",
      "Health ministers across the UK say they are working on plans to improve the situation, but health leaders say that women are being let down.",
      "'The illness controls my whole life'",
      "Anna Cooper, 31, from near Wrexham in North Wales, has had severe endometriosis since her teens.",
      "The condition - where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside it  - has  left her with permanent organ damage.",
      "She has had to have 17 operations, including a hysterectomy to remove her womb.",
      "She also has two stomas in place for life because much of her bladder and bowel have had to be removed. She lives with her partner and young daughter.",
      "\"The disease controls my social life, my work life and my ability to function every day.",
      "\"It is not just a period problem - it is a whole body problem. It ripples through your body,\" she says.",
      "The BBC spoke to her in 2023 about setting up her own charity, Menstrual Health Project.",
      "A year on, she says she is still in pain and is on the NHS waiting list yet again because she has experienced bleeding after her hysterectomy.",
      "Anna wears a morphine patch to help deal with pain every day.",
      "But for years, she says medics did not listen to her, and told her the pain was \"in her head\" and that she had to \"just get used to it\".",
      "She feels getting a diagnosis sooner would have changed her life: \"The delay in my care has cost me some of my major organs.",
      "\"Doctors have told me that if they'd caught it sooner, I wouldn't have ended up the way I am, living with two stomas and being in early menopause at the age of 31.\"",
      "In the last three years she made the decision to spend \u00a325,000 on private operations, borrowing money to help.",
      "She counts herself lucky to get private care but feels she was \"almost left with no choice\" because the waiting lists are so long: \"I can be a mum who isn't just in her bed constantly because she is crippled with pain.\"",
      "Endometriosis has \"mentally tormented\" her for the most of her adult life.",
      "\"It is really difficult dealing with a condition where I look absolutely fine from the outside, but internally, I'm just in despair.\"",
      "'Lack of priority'",
      "\"Women are being let down\" and change is \"urgently needed,\" says Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).",
      "The college's new report looks at the impact on people waiting for care.",
      "\"Gynaecology is the only elective speciality that solely treats women and has one of the worst waiting lists across the UK.",
      "\"This reflects the persistent lack of priority given to women and women\u2019s health, \" Dr Thakar says.",
      "\"Women are suffering. We know it is affecting their mental health. They are not able to go to work, they are not able to socialize.\"",
      "Dr Thakar adds that if the women had been treated earlier, their conditions wouldn't have progressed as much, and they would continue to contribute to society.",
      "A recent report led by the NHS Confederation suggests being absent from work because of heavy periods, endometriosis, fibroids and ovarian cysts costs the UK economy nearly \u00a311 billion each year.",
      "The RCOG is calling for governments to commit more long-term funding, to ensure people get the help they need.",
      "There are some signs that waiting lists are starting to improve.",
      "Waits have not been rising as steeply this year and NHS England's latest figures show there has been a drop in numbers on the waiting list of over 4,700 compared to the month before.",
      "But the situation is still much worse than pre-pandemic. In Feb 2020 there were 66 gynaecology  waits of more than a year. Now there are more than 22,000.",
      "Women on gynae waiting lists 'feel abandoned'",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS England's national clinical director for women\u2019s health, acknowledged  some women wait too long for crucial gynaecology appointments, despite staff working hard to see more patients.",
      "She says one way of helping is specialist teams working outside of hospitals.",
      "\u201cSome of these conditions can be managed very well by specialist healthcare teams in the community, which is why we are expanding neighbourhood women\u2019s health hubs in every local care system across the country.\"",
      "In Wales, the government plans to publish a women's health plan next month.",
      "\u201cA 10-year Women\u2019s Health Plan is being developed to drive the improvement needed to provide good quality health services to women throughout their lifetime,\"  a Welsh Government spokesperson said.",
      "Regions in Northern Ireland are working on plans to improve gynaecology services, taking on the 20 recommendations made in a recent report.",
      "The department of health says some will require \"additional funding and lead-in time.\"",
      "Scotland's Women\u2019s Health Minister Jenni Minto said excessively long waits were not acceptable and more money was going towards women's health.",
      "\"That is why one of the initial priorities of the women\u2019s health plan is to improve access for women to appropriate support, diagnosis and treatment.\"",
      "Anna Cooper is hoping ministers \"follow through with their words\".",
      "When governments say they are going to prioritize women's health, then they need to show they are doing just that, she says.",
      "\"Currently they are not showing it, and this is people's lives we are rolling the dice on... And having a daughter, I really fear for young girls' and women's futures.\"",
      "How we arrived at the figures",
      "To estimate the size of the gynaecology waiting list for the UK we added together the most recent figures available for all four nations, as tracked by the RCOG.",
      "This includes waits for gynaecology appointments and planned procedures and excludes urgent appointments for things like suspected cancer.",
      "It tells you how big the waiting list is, but some patients may need more than one appointment.",
      "Our estimate for the number of people waiting is at least 634,239  - and it  could be considerably more.",
      "We worked this out by looking at data from the NHS in England that suggests across waiting lists there is around a 16% difference between the number of appointments and people waiting.",
      "We have applied this to the gynaecology waiting list.",
      "It could underestimate the size of the problem, as gynaecology patients are less likely to be waiting for two appointments than patients in some other specialities.",

    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",

      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",

    "summary": "The first in-person meeting since 2018 will come as the PM prioritises shoring up support for Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer is due to meet President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Brazil, with the government saying it wants \"stable and pragmatic engagement\" with China.",
      "The meeting will be the first time a UK prime minister has met the Chinese president in person since 2018.",
      "Sir Keir will say it is right to engage with China on \"areas of mutual cooperation\" such as international stability, climate change and economic growth.",
      "But Downing Street said he would also \"be firm on the need to have honest conversations on areas of disagreement,\" and that engagement would be \"rooted at all times in the UK's national interests\".",
      "Speaking to reporters on his way to the summit in Rio de Janeiro, Sir Keir said \"shoring up support for Ukraine\" was top of his agenda.",
      "Downing Street says the prime minister will urge other G20 nations to step up their support for Ukraine or face \"unfathomable consequences\" if Russia is allowed to be victorious.",
      "The summit follows large-scale missile and drone attacks by Russia across Ukraine over the weekend, and will take place as the conflict approaches its 1,000th day.",
      "And it comes amid reports that the US has authorised the use of long-range missiles it supplies to Ukraine to strike Russia.",
      "The weapons have so far only been used by Kyiv on Russian-occupied targets within its own territory.",
      "The UK has also supplied Ukraine with its Storm Shadow missiles and defence officials and ministers have for months been making the case for Kyiv to be permitted to use them to hit targets inside Russia. But they were not willing to act alone - and had been waiting for the White House to change its mind.",
      "Downing Street has not directly commented on the reports about the US decision.",
      "Labour tiptoes nervously towards a China policy",
      "Honest talks needed, Starmer tells Chinese leader",
      "How long-range missiles striking Russia could affect Ukraine war",
      "Downing Street said Sir Keir and President Xi were expected to meet on Monday.",
      "The pair spoke over the phone in August, after Labour's election victory the previous month, but they have not yet met in person.",
      "China's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine has prompted criticism from the UK and other Western countries.",
      "The prime minister said: \"It is in the UK\u2019s best interests to engage on the global stage - whether that\u2019s building strong and fruitful partnerships with our closest allies or being frank with those whose values differ from our own.",
      "\"Close cooperation with the world\u2019s leading economies is vital to secure investment into the UK, and create the jobs needed to catalyse growth.\"",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as well as Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, in Beijing last month.",
      "The last British prime minister to meet President Xi was Theresa May, who hailed a \"golden era\" for UK-China relations during her 2018 visit to the country.",
      "However, since then there have been tensions over issues including China's treatment of the Uyghur minority group in Xinjiang and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.",
      "Last year, then-Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said China was \"the biggest state-based threat to our economic security\".",
      "But like the current government, he also said it was necessary to engage with China on issues like climate change and the global economy.",
      "Sir Keir is holding similar talks with other G20 leaders, representing 19 of the world\u2019s largest economies and the African Union and the European Union.",
      "The summit is overshadowed by the absence of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump has called for allies to take a more aggressive approach towards China and may trigger a global trade war if he imposes a promised 60% tariff on Chinese goods entering the US.",
      "This summit will provide world leaders a first chance to compare notes and prepare for Trump's upcoming return to the White House.",
      "Downing Street said the prime minister would also be focusing on building partnerships that increase economic growth and security during the summit, accelerating the climate transition and use of clean power, and supporting the economic development of developing countries.",

    "summary": "Starmer's farmer-alarmer in the Budget could crystalise anger over ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about agricultural life.",
    "story": [
      "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election.",
      "It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them.",
      "Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.",
      "Nearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing.",
      "There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected.",
      "BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers.",
      "But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors.",
      "Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4,  Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\".",
      "Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds.",
      "And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power.",
      "Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities.",
      "The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting.",
      "Could this inheritance tax change prove equally totemic?",
      "As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days.",
      "But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes.",
      "\u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said.",
      "The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget.  I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.",
      "Asked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d",
      "He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside.",
      "\"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming.",
      "\"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d",
      "Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union.",
      "Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England  as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas.",
      "It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well.",
      "So why has this row become so noisy so quickly?",
      "From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.",
      "Bid to soften farm tax change rejected by Treasury",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Tax change 'is existential threat to farmers'",
      "Firstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it.",
      "The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21.",
      "Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed.",
      "For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone.",
      "Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d",
      "Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes.",
      "Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food.",
      "Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context.",
      "\u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me.",
      "There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them.",
      "There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit.",
      "And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years.",
      "Put them all together and there is a disillusion and a widespread sense among farmers of not being listened to.",
      "Westminster is certain to hear them this week.",
      "Sainsbury's and M&S warn Budget may push up prices",
      "Bereaved son speaks of farmers' financial stress",

    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",
      "Annie Hudson, the panel's chair, said the new legislation would \"go some way towards tackling some of the systemic weaknesses that can create the conditions where very vulnerable children are abused and neglected\".",

      "Culture of abuse found at special schools - review",
      "Assaults and neglect revealed in care homes probe",

      "Strengthening the rights of families to be involved in decisions about a child going into careRequiring every council to have multi-agency child safeguarding teamsRequiring local authorities to offer support for care leavers, including helping them find accommodation, until the age of 21Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",

      "The BBC understands that the government will also outline action to deal with the rise in Deprivation of Liberty Orders, which have increased 12-fold in the last seven years.",
      "These court orders allow children to be locked up - in registered or unregistered homes - and are often granted for children who are a risk to themselves or others. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, says far fewer should be granted.",
      "Responding to the government's plans, the Children's Home Association (CHA), which represents providers in England and Wales, said the new Ofsted powers that will \"tackle unregistered and unregulated illegal residential provision is long overdue\".",
      "However, it argued the \"backstop\" law that threatens to cap providers' profits \"risks serious unintended consequences\" as it would \"incentivise more providers to adopt offshore interest and debt-driven business models\".",
      "The CHA also criticised Phillipson's comment that the sector was letting families down, saying it was \"not involved with families or their decisions\" and took in children \"because social work and preventative measures fail, likely due to local authorities' lack of financial resources\".",

      "The prime minister, health secretary and chancellor are due to meet in the next 10 days to discuss the issue.",

      "Pressed over whether the government was taking the problem seriously, she told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the health secretary had already set out a 10-year plan for the NHS which included focusing on prevention and community care, which she said would \"ease pressures on social care\".",

      "This means some people face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Deborah Crisp told the programme how three years ago her 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, had to sell her flat for just under \u00a3200,000 to pay for a care home - and that amount had already been used up.",

      "Now 86, Mr Morris is one of the last few of 22,000 personnel who witnessed the UK\u2019s nuclear bomb tests - and those that are able to are still fighting to find out what it did their bodies.",
      "A BBC film, to be broadcast this Wednesday, details their battles for what the dwindling band of men believe is a hidden truth: that the UK\u2019s military knew at the time it was subjecting them to radiation that would damage them and their descendants forever.",
      "Thousands of the men have suffered cancers and other conditions that other nuclear states have recognised as probably linked to the now-banned testing.",
      "But not the UK. It has paid no compensation at all.",
      "In Mr Morris\u2019s case, as the film reveals, he believes the death of his first child, Steven, in 1962, was the result of the radiation damage he suffered during Operation Grapple - the name given to a series of British nuclear weapons tests.",
      "Steven was four months old when he died in his cot. The coroner suspected the baby\u2019s lung had not properly formed. Why? Nobody knows.",
      "\"The death certificate said he died of pneumonia,\" says Mr Morris.",

      "\u201cI blame the Ministry of Defence and the experiments they did on us for Steven's death - and I always will.\u201d",
      "John Morris\u2019s story is one of many testimonies in the film, which also covers what happened to Indigenous communities who lived in the nuclear bomb test areas in Australia.",

      "And they are appealing to Sir Keir Starmer to meet them - to make good on what they believe was a pledge made by the Labour party.",
      "The campaign for disclosure and damages for ill health began decades ago as the veterans linked health conditions, cancers and birth defects in children to the nuclear testing that began in 1952.",
      "But in 2012, the Supreme Court ended the campaign for damages, saying the men could not prove the link - and they had also long run out of time.",
      "The campaign, however, was relaunched last year thanks to potentially crucial new evidence discovered in what is known as the \u201cGledhill memo\u201d.",

      "The circumstantial evidence has grown since. This year, 4,000 pages of documents from the Atomic Weapons Establishment were declassified after a long Freedom of Information fight.",
      "Those documents are still being analysed but the campaign says they show there were standing orders for repeated blood and urine tests of military personnel and Indigenous communities at the test sites.",

      "John Morris\u2019s military medical file, for instance, is missing regular blood tests from Christmas Island that he says were part of the regime.",

    "story": [
      "The Home Office \"cut corners\" and made \"poor decisions\", while under pressure to stop housing migrants in hotels, when it paid \u00a315m for an asbestos-contaminated derelict prison, the government's spending watchdog has said.",
      "The National Audit Office (NAO) said the amount paid for the Northeye site in East Sussex in 2023 under the Conservative government was more than twice what the seller paid in 2022.",
      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",
      "In December 2022, then-prime minister Rishi Sunak delivered a statement in Parliament in which he vowed to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, saying that the government would \"work to achieve this as quickly as possible\".",
      "In its report, the NAO said the statement \"generated significant pressure within the Home Office to identify and secure sites for asylum accommodation at pace\".",
      "It added that, the following January, a decision to acquire Northeye was taken by a small group of ministers and officials from across Whitehall, despite the \"technical due diligence and approvals process not having been undertaken\".",
      "The group included the minister for immigration and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the report said, positions then held by Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden.",
      "'High risk'",
      "In February 2023, an environmental review identified a contamination risk from \"asbestos-containing materials in existing buildings and contaminated ground\", while a due diligence report assessed conditions at the site as \"high risk\".",
      "The diligence report also estimated the cost of repairs to buildings at the site to be \u00a320m, although this figure was not included in advice later submitted to ministers.",
      "The following month, Jenrick announced that Northeye would be developed to house 1,200 people, and the sale was completed in September 2023.",
      "The final price paid for the site was \u00a315.4m, including \u00a30.9m paid to the vendors - Brockwell Group Bexhill LLP - because the Home Office had underestimated how long it would take to complete the purchase.",
      "Brockwell had bought Northeye in August 2022 for \u00a36.3m.",
      "The costs of remediation because of the contamination at the site were estimated to be between \u00a31.1m and \u00a33.6m.",
      "The NAO concluded that the Home Office's attempt to acquire Northeye \"within just a few months... led it to cut corners and make a series of poor decisions\".",
      "\"This resulted in it purchasing a site that was unsuitable for [its] original purpose, and it paying more for it than it needed to.\"",

      "But in May 2023, the government concluded the site was unsuitable for that purpose and said it would be used instead for detained accommodation.",

    "title": "Building more prisons not answer to crisis - Gauke",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:20:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The man in charge of reviewing sentencing says a more \"strategic\" approach to prisons is needed.",
    "story": [
      "The man in charge of a review of the prisons crisis says building more jails is not the answer and a more \"strategic\" approach is needed to free up space.",
      "The former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke has been called in by Labour to review sentencing, following the early release of nearly 3,000 offenders in recent weeks.",
      "The sentencing review was a Labour manifesto pledge and the party has also appointed Lord Timpson, former head of the key-cutting chain that hires ex-offenders and chief of the Prison Reform Trust, as its prisons minister.",
      "Gauke, who was justice secretary under Theresa May, has previously suggested that jail terms of less than six months should be scrapped.",
      "Ex-Tory Gauke to lead review of prison sentences",
      "Prisoners released early but some victims 'not warned'",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "The UK prison population has roughly doubled in the last 30 years, with capacity lagging behind, and in September the system came within 100 places of running out of space altogether.",
      "Gauke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that this autumn's crisis release of prisoners was unavoidable for the new Labour government because of \"the circumstances they inherited\".",
      "Stressing \"I do not speak as a Labour person\", he said \"any government of any colour would have been forced to make that decision, or something very like that decision, at that particular time\".",
      "He warned projections showed demand for prison cells would continue to \"increase very significantly\", but he hoped the sentencing review could help avoid the same crunchpoint in future, by reducing the number of people sent to jail.",
      "\"What we want to avoid is a situation where prisoners are being released as a short-term, reduce-the-pressure moment,\" he said.",
      "\"What we have to be is more strategic - we have to make sure that prison capacity meets demand and that means we have to look at the question of demand on prison places and that's I think where looking at the sentencing regime is necessary and important.\"",
      "The current prisons crisis had built up over 30 years, Gauke said, due to successive government decisions to make average sentences longer, creating a situation where the UK \"relies much more heavily on prison than any other western European country\".",
      "Although he said prisons were an important part of the justice system, he suggested simply building more prisons was not the answer.",
      "\"You can argue you build your way out of it, you just keep building those prisons,\" he said.",
      "\"That evidently has not happened but I think there is a question to be asked - do we want to keep on building prison capacity when, one, it's very expensive and two, the evidence does not suggest that it's an effective way of reducing crime.\"",
      "Instead, he talked about using technology to create tougher non-custodial sentences, following approaches taken by other countries with much lower prison populations.",
      "With more than half the women in jail serving sentences of six months or less, Gauke said reducing the female prison population was also an option to free up space.",
      "He said: \"Clearly there are some women prisoners who must go to prison, who commit serious offences and it's right that prison is where they go, but I think there is a case for looking at short sentences more generally.",
      "\"There's a particular issue with women offender who are very often themselves victims of crime, very often face issues with mental health, substance abuse and so on that could be addressed outside prison.",
      "\"So I would certainly want to look at that, and I said this as justice secretary, I think we could reduce the female prison population.\"",
      "Latest government figures show more than half of women are sent to jail for less than six months, compared to 3% of the total prison population being behind bars for that length of time.",
      "The sentencing review is now open for submissions from the public about how  the prison system can be improved and will submit findings to the Lord Chancellor by Spring 2025."

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 11:20:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The department for rural affairs suggested exempting some older farmers from having to pay, Newsnight is told.",
    "story": [
      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "The department was informed about the policy the night before it was announced in the Budget.",
      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",
      "It put this against a backdrop of \u201cpublic services crumbling [and] a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government\".",
      "\u201cAround 500 claims each year will be impacted and farm-owning couples can pass on up to \u00a33m without paying any inheritance tax - this is a fair and balanced approach,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "There are divisions in government over the change.",
      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",
      "But other ministers believe the chancellor is in danger of undermining Labour\u2019s relations with rural Britain while raising a relatively small amount of money.",
      "The change could raise around \u00a3560m.",
      "Some sources in government have expressed concerns that the chancellor is creating unnecessary grief over a change that is not, in relative terms, a huge money spinner.",
      "There are concerns that the change - which has proved controversial among farmers since its announcement - could become \u201ctotemic\u201d in rural Britain.",
      "Protests",
      "The NFU warned it would \u201csnatch away the next generation\u2019s ability to carry on producing British food\u201d and see farmers forced to sell land to pay the tax.",
      "A rally to protest against the plan will be held in Whitehall next Tuesday.",
      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",
      "Farmers' leaders have been told by Defra that the figures come from the Treasury and not their department.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",
      "Clive Bailey, founder of the Farming Forum which is also organising a protest in central London next week, said on Thursday that any change to the new rules \u201cwould be a step forward\u201d.",
      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",
      "Compared with the wider population, farming sees \"a lot of people who should have retired already still working\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",
      "He called the inheritance rules \u201cso poorly thought out\u201d.",
      "The cost of running a viable farm exceeded \u00a31m, he said, arguing that the government needed to sit down \"with real family farmers or agricultural economists\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",
      "'The policy will not change'",
      "During rural affairs questions in the Commons, Conservative shadow environment minister Robbie Moore accused the government of \"arrogance\" and urged ministers to publish a full impact assessment of the change.",
      "Environment minister Daniel Zeichner reiterated the government's figures that fewer than 500 farms a year would be affected.",
      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",
      "Another Tory MP, former cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright, asked if ministers had considered limiting inheritance tax exemptions to those who could prove a farm had been in family ownership for \"a certain number of years\".",
      "Zeichner replied that the issue was \"complicated\", adding \"in future we will have further discussions\".",
      "Lib Dem environment spokesman Tim Farron said the tax rise would be a \"disaster for family farms\".",

      "Streeting, who plans to vote against a new assisted dying bill when it is debated later this month, has suggested what is proposed could lead to cuts in other NHS services.",
      "The bill, published on Monday, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their life if two doctors and a High Court judge verify they are eligible and have made their decision voluntarily.",

      "He said the health service would \"need to work through with the medical profession what would be a very new way of working\".",

      "The prime minister, a former director of public prosecutions, has previously supported assisted dying, but the government has pledged to remain neutral on the issue, and MPs are being allowed to vote according to their conscience rather than along party lines.",
      "This will be the first Commons vote on assisted dying since MPs rejected allowing terminally ill adults to end their lives under medical supervision in 2015. As a backbench Labour MP, Streeting voted in favour of that measure.",
      "If the bill passes its first vote later this month, it will receive further scrutiny from MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it."

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 13:12:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:36:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

      "Five weeks after Sue Gray resigned as the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, with the prospect of her being sacked hovering close, she is off again.",
      "And just like last time, even the manner of her departure is contested.",
      "We have been told the prime minister had decided to withdraw the offer for Ms Gray to be his envoy to the nations and regions.",

      "Her apparent lack of enthusiasm was almost immediately evident, when she failed to turn up at the first ever meeting of a new Council of the Nations and Regions in Edinburgh just days into the job.",
      "What followed were daily questions to the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman from reporters about whether she had taken up her post.",
      "After weeks of stonewalling, an answer: no.",
      "One insider got in touch about the envoy role and said: \"We all thought it was a bad idea that would lead to endless drama and probably another resignation down the line.\"",
      "In other words, what might have seemed like a mutually convenient layby into which Ms Gray could be shunted, ended up perpetuating a rather public soap opera.",
      "Some sceptics had seen the new gig as a non-job from the start. The government saying it isn\u2019t looking to fill the vacancy will do little to dispel that instinct from those who thought it all along.",

      "There are also concerns, reported by the BBC, that Azerbaijani officials are using the climate conference to boost investment in the country\u2019s national oil and gas company.",
      "Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev told the conference that oil and gas are \u201ca gift of god\u201d, and that countries should not be blamed for having them, or selling them on the international market.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Mr Guterres told the conference that doubling down on the use of fossil fuels was \"absurd\".",

      "On my screen I can see that behind her, on a shelf, is her toy monkey, Mr H.",
      "The toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend and has travelled the world with her. Dr Goodall is now 90 years of age, and she and Mr H are still travelling.",
      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "Apple is facing a legal claim accusing it of effectively locking 40 million British customers into its iCloud service and charging them \"rip off prices\".",

      "Facebook, Google, gaming giant Steam and the UK's leading mobile providers are among the others facing legal claims at the same court, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.",
      "\"Although most of these claims are in their infancy and take a long time to resolve, there will be more decisions coming out over the next couple of years and there will be settlements - these will start to affect the tech giants\u2019 businesses,\" said Mr Starr.",

    "summary": "Its record price is making headlines - but that's just one part of the cryptocurrency's tumultuous story.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.",
      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",

      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",

      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",

      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "summary": "It can be hard to find good advice on how to make homes more energy efficient.",
    "story": [
      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I would think is the logical way of thinking about this,\u201d he says.",

      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",

      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",

      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",

      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",

      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",

      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",

      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "Donald Trump is facing opposition in some corners over key hires he has announced ahead of his return to the White House.",
      "Though some of the Republican president-elect's personnel decisions are immediate, many must go through further vetting.",
      "Several of the posts require a Senate hearing and a majority of the chamber's approval.",
      "But Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to unilaterally appoint nominees if the Senate is not in session.",
      "Senate vetting: How does it work?",
      "More than 1,000 positions - including the 15 officials chosen to lead executive departments, known as the Cabinet - typically require Senate approval. This also includes ambassadors and even some lower-level positions.",
      "But many members of Trump's team, including those who work in the White House or posts like the national security adviser, don't require Senate approval. They still are vetted, however, by the administration and could face intensive FBI background checks.",
      "On Thursday, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Fox News that he does not anticipate a smooth road for each nominee.",
      "'None of this is gonna be easy,' he said.",
      "The FBI says members who are subject to vetting include presidential appointees, White House staff, positions requiring Senate confirmation, and other national security positions requiring security clearance.",
      "The FBI says it \"does not adjudicate or render an opinion on the results of the background investigation\", which are then sent to the office of the president-elect or the office of White House Counsel for their use \"as deemed appropriate\".",
      "It also is responsible for focusing \"on character and conduct\" and completing its investigation \"as expeditiously as possible.\"",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s transition team is\u202fbypassing FBI background checks for some cabinet picks, according to anonymous sources, CNN reported. It also has considered turning to private vetting companies. BBC has not independently verified this.",

      "The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee.",
      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",
      "But some Republicans already have questioned at least one Trump choice, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the nominee for post of attorney general, or top prosecutor in the US.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",
      "George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",
      "This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.",

      "Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, says recess appointments are \"not meant to be a mechanism for circumventing Senate consent\".",
      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",

      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.",

      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",

      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",

      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",

      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",

      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",

      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",

      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",

      "A week after Donald Trump won a second-term in the White House, the contours of his new presidency have started taking shape.",
      "The president-elect has announced nearly a dozen appointees, the first steps toward filling out his White House staff and key government departments. He also made comments to the media and on social media that highlight what his priorities will be upon taking office in January, with a special focus on immigration and foreign policy.",
      "After a sometimes chaotic start to his first term, Trump is laying the groundwork for his next administration with a more clearly defined plan - and personnel ready to enact it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what we\u2019ve learned so far.",
      "Follow live: Trump transition updates",
      "Follow live: Trump transition updates",
      "A hard-line immigration team in place",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect\u2019s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters. Now it looks like the next Trump administration will pick up where the last one left off.",

      "Musk's new role",
      "While the list of Trump\u2019s political appointees grows, there\u2019s another group that stays small \u2013 and exceedingly influential.",
      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he was assigning Musk to work with tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a \"department of government efficiency\" tasked with identifying new budget cuts.",
      "Musk has regularly offered his political opinions on his social media platform X, including endorsing Florida Senator Rick Scott\u2019s bid to be the next Senate majority leader.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",
      "Trump may be placing a premium on loyalty with his early staff announcements, but the pressures of governing ultimately will reveal whether his second four years in office end up different from his first.",

He referred to \"first of all\" firing the US' top military officer, Gen Charles \"CQ\" Brown Jr, saying people involved in diversity, equality or inclusion policies had \"got to go\".",

      "Under the pretence of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d- a term fabricated by her perpetrators - Dr Tandon was coerced to take leave from work, surrender her daily freedoms, and comply with nonstop surveillance and instructions from strangers on the phone, who convinced her she was at the centre of a grave investigation.",

      "She is not alone. Indians lost over 1,200m rupees to \u201cdigital arrest\u201d hoaxes between January and April this year, according to official figures. These figures only scratch the surface, as many victims don\u2019t report such crimes. Stolen funds are often funnelled into overseas accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. More than 40% of the scams have been traced back to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, according to officials.",

      "Sometimes scammers reveal themselves during video calls, while other times they remain hidden, relying solely on audio. The plot could be straight out of an outlandish Bollywood thriller - except it is carefully choreographed.",
      "On that fateful first day, scammers posing as officials from India\u2019s telecom regulator called Lucknow-based Dr Tandon, claiming her number would be disconnected due to \u201c22 complaints\u201d of harassing messages sent from it.",
      "Moments later, a man claiming to be a senior police officer took over. He accused her of using a joint bank account with her mother to launder money for women and child trafficking.",
      "In the background, a jarring chorus of voices echoed, \u201cArrest her, arrest her!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police will be coming in five minutes to arrest you. All police stations have been alerted,\u201d the man warned.",
      "\u201cI was angry and frustrated. I kept saying this can\u2019t be true,\u201d Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "The officer seemed to soften, but with a catch. He said India\u2019s federal detective agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), would take over as it was a \u201cmatter of national secrecy\".",
      "\u201cI will try to talk and persuade them not to put you in physical custody. But you have to be in digital custody,\u201d he insisted.",
      "Dr Tandon used a feature phone that lacked video calling, making it impossible for the scammers to proceed. So they forced her to drive to a store and buy a smartphone.",
      "Over the next six days, three men and a woman, posing as police officers and a judge, kept her under constant surveillance on Skype, with her phone camera running nonstop.",
      "They made her wake up her students at night to buy extra data packs to keep the scam going. She was required to place the phone throughout the house - while cooking, sleeping, and even outside the bathroom - tracking her every move.",
      "She was also forced to lie to her hospital and relatives, claiming she was too ill to work or meet anyone. When an uncle visited, they ordered her to hide under a bed, with the phone camera running.",
      "For a full week, Dr Tandon endured more 700 questions on her life and work, a staged trial, falsified court documents, and promises of a digital \u201cbail\u201d in exchange for her life savings. In the fake court she was ordered to dress in white to \u201cshow respect to the judge\". The callers had switched off their video, leaving only their fake names and authentic-looking badges displayed on blank screens.",
      "At one point, during the ordeal, the scammers even talked to Dr Tandon\u2019s 70-year-old mother, urging her to stay silent \"for her daughter\u2019s sake\".",
      "When the doctor repeatedly broke down on camera, the scammers told her: \u201cTake a deep breath and relax. You have not committed a murder. You have just laundered money.\"",
      "In a desperate bid for freedom, she transferred her entire savings from half-a-dozen different bank accounts to accounts controlled by the scammers, believing she would be refunded after \u201cgovernment verification\". Instead, she lost everything. The callers disconnected the line after transfer was completed.",
      "Back at work after a week, exhaustion drove Dr Tandon to search terms like \u201cdigital custody\u201d and \u201cnew CBI investigation methods\u201d on the internet.",
      "This led to newspaper stories detailing similar \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scams across the country. She still had refused to accept she was a victim of an elaborate hoax, and had rushed to the police station, hoping that \u201cthe police station and officers were real\u201d.",
      "Dr Tandon says she approached the police station, anxious.",
      "\"I've been receiving strange calls for days,\" she started, trying to explain.",
      "Before she could say more, a woman officer interrupted sharply, \"Have you transferred any money?\"",
      "At another police station, \"the moment they heard my case, they began laughing\", Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "\"This is very common now,\u201d a policeman said.",
      "Over 500km (310 miles) away in Delhi, author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay narrowly escaped the scam in July.",
      "He endured 28 hours under \"digital arrest,\" as scammers claimed that his defunct bank account had been used to launder money. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s suspicions aroused when a caller asked him why he hadn't redeemed his mutual funds - not a question a police officer would usually ask on the phone.",
      "Mr Mukhopadhyay slipped from his study, where scammers were surveilling him on his desktop, and confided briefly with his wife. Friends, alerted by his message, quickly asked her to disconnect his modem, freeing him from their grip.",
      "\"I became a digital slave until my friends exposed the scam,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"I had moved my funds into my account, ready to transfer it all to them. I felt like a fool when it was over.\u201d",
      "Progress on catching these scammers remains unclear, with many victims frustrated by slow moving complaint processes.",
      "Dr Tandon, however, has seen some success: police have arrested 18 suspects, including a woman, from across India. About a third of the stolen money has been recovered in cash and seized in different bank accounts.  She has received only 1.2m of the 25m rupees of her looted money so far \u2013 that was the cash recovered.",
      "Investigating officer Deepak Kumar Singh says the scammers were running an elaborate operation.",
      "\"The scammers are educated men and women - fluent in English and various Indian languages - including engineering graduates, cyber security experts, and banking professionals. Most operate through Telegram channels,\" Mr Singh, a senior police official, told the BBC.",
      "The scammers were clever, using targeted information from their victims' social media, investigators believe.",
      "\"They track you, gather personal information, and identify your weaknesses,\" says Mr Singh. \"Then they strike quickly, using a hit-and-run approach with potential victims.\"",
      "The scammers knew Mr Mukhopadhyay was a journalist and writer - author of a biography on Prime Minister Modi. They knew Dr Tandon was a doctor and had attended a conference in Goa. They had their biometric national identity numbers. Mr Mukhopadhyay wonders if they were aware he was among the journalists whose house was raided by Delhi police in October 2023 as part of an investigation into the funding of NewsClick (Critics had deplored the move as an attack on press freedom, a charge the government denied.)",
      "They also made errors. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s caller was unaware of how long it typically took to redeem funds, which raised his suspicions. Dr Tandon\u2019s fake judge, called himself Judge Dhananjay and displayed a fake insignia with a picture of the recently retired Chief Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud. Yet, overwhelmed by the moment, she missed the clue.",
      "Dr Tandon says she still lives in a haze, struggling to separate reality from the nightmare that overtook her life. Even when she filed the police complaint, she wondered, \u201cWas the police station also fake?\u201d",
      "Every phone call stirs fresh anxiety.",

      "For generations, her family had lived among the orchards and green lands in the heart of the Hunza valley in the Karakorum mountains of Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan region.",

      "Upstream, a glacial lake had formed, then suddenly burst - sending water, boulders and debris cascading down the valley and gathering speed. The ground trembled so violently some people thought there was an earthquake.",
      "When the torrent hit the cement bridge that connected the two parts of the village, it turned it to rubble.",
      "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",
      "That was until they received a phone call from the other side of the valley; their neighbours could see that the water was stripping away the hillside their home stood on.",
      "Then the homes began to collapse.",
      "\u201cI remember my aunt and uncle were still inside their home when the flood came and washed out the whole kitchen,\u201d she says. The family made it to safe ground, but their homes disappeared over the edge.",
      "Today, walking through the grey rubble and dust, there are still coat hooks on the wall, a few tiles in the bathroom, a window with the glass long gone. It\u2019s been two years, but nothing has grown on the crumbling cliff that used to be Komal's garden in Hassanabad.",
      "\u201cThis used to be all a green place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I visit this place I remember my childhood memories, the time I spent here. But the barren places, they hurt me, they make me feel sad.\u201d",

      "There are other mitigation measures across the region; stone and wire barriers to try to slow floodwater, systems to monitor glacier melt, rainfall and water levels, speakers installed in villages to warn the community if danger looks likely. But many who work here say they need more resources.",
      "\u201cWe have installed early warning systems in some valleys,\u201d says Mr Ahmed. \u201cThese were identified by the Pakistan Meteorological Department and they gave us a list of around 100 valleys. But because of limited resources, we are only able to intervene in 16.\u201d",

    "summary": "Citizen activists are taking unusual steps to push authorities for better pedestrian infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "In India, if you ask a pedestrian how many obstacles they've encountered on a footpath, they may not be able to count them - but they'll certainly tell you that most footpaths are in poor condition.",
      "This is what Arun Pai says he learnt when he started asking people about their experience walking on the streets of his city, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), in southern India.",
      "This month he set up a \"fun challenge\" - called the 'world's longest footpath run' - which invited people to walk or jog on an 11km (8 miles) stretch of footpath and make a note of all the obstacles they encountered, like hawkers, garbage or broken slabs of concrete. Next, they were asked to rate the footpath on a scale of one to five.",
      "\"When you have specifics, it gets easier to ask the authorities to take action. Instead of telling your local politician \"the footpaths are bad\", you can ask him or her \"to fix specific spots on a street,\" Mr Pai says.",
      "Mr Pai, who is the founder of Bangalore Walks, a non-profit that promotes walking, is among several citizen activists who are pushing to make the country's roads more pedestrian-friendly.",
      "In India's capital, a tour company called Delhi by Cycle has been advocating for making the city more cycle-friendly and walkable. These walking-enthusiasts are holding awareness walks, building walking apps and lobbying with politicians to make a change.",
      "Even in India's biggest cities, proper footpaths are few and far between and they are often overrun by hawkers and shops, parked vehicles and even cattle. In some places, they double up as homes for the poor.",
      "Even footpaths that exist are often not built to standard or properly maintained. Navigating roads on foot through crowds and traffic can be a nightmare.",
      "Last month, Walking Project, a citizen's group in India's financial capital, Mumbai, released a 'pedestrian manifesto' ahead of Maharashtra state elections to highlight the poor condition of the city's roads and encourage local politicians to take action.",
      "The manifesto included demands for better parking, designated hawking zones, pedestrian-friendly corridors on arterial roads and to make footpaths more accessible to those with mobility challenges.",
      "\"Government statistics show that almost 50% of the city's population relies on walking, which is far greater than the 11% that uses private transport and the combined 15% that uses tuk-tuks and buses,\" says Vendant Mhatre, convener of Walking Project.",
      "\"And yet, pedestrians are the most ignored group of users when it comes to framing policies around transport or road safety,\" he adds.",
      "According to the latest government estimates on road accidents, pedestrian fatalities were the second-highest after those of two-wheeler riders. In 2022, over 10,000 pedestrians lost their lives on national highways across the country, with around 21,000 more sustaining injuries in accidents.",
      "\"Authorities often resort to band-aid solutions like adding speed bumps or a signal to curb road accidents. But what is really needed is inter-connected footpaths that can accommodate high footfall,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Studies have found that addressing the problems of this forgotten group of road users can reap benefits for multiple stakeholders.",
      "In 2019, researchers in the southern city of Chennai studied the impact the construction of new footpaths on 100km (62 miles) of the city's streets had on the environment, economy and the health and safety of citizens.",
      "They found that the new footpaths encouraged 9% to 27% of the surveyed respondents to walk instead of using motorized transport, which led to a reduction in greenhouse gases and particulate matter. They also learned that the footpaths provided new opportunities for women and lower-income groups, helping them save money as well.",
      "The survey highlighted how people with disabilities and women might have nuanced requirements from footpaths and that tailoring improvements to meet their needs could enhance accessibility and equity.",
      "\"Very often, people don't have a benchmark for footpath quality, especially if they haven't travelled abroad or been exposed to places that have good facilities for pedestrians,\" Mr Mhatre says. He reasons that that's why there isn't enough outrage about the quality or absence of footpaths in the country.",
      "He also points out that most people see walking as an activity performed for leisure or exercise. And so, the infrastructure they associate with walking stops at gardens or walking tracks. In reality, however, people walk to various destinations daily, so the scope of walking infrastructure is far broader.",
      "\"Walking is the most economical and environment-friendly way to navigate one's city and it's high time our leaders paid as much attention to walking infrastructure as they do to public transport,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Geetam Tiwari, a professor of civil engineering, says that the main problem is that too much focus is given to solving the problem of car congestion on roads.",
      "\"To improve the flow of traffic, authorities often narrow down footpaths or eliminate them entirely,\" she says. Ms Tiwari says that this approach is problematic because doing so makes it difficult for pedestrians to access public transport systems, like buses and metros, which can take the pressure off the roads.",
      "\"It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing the congestion to persist and focussing on improving infrastructure for pedestrians will help solve the traffic problem in the long run,\" she says.",
      "Ms Tiwari also says that the federal government should make it mandatory for states to implement the guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress -  a national organisation that lays down designing standards for roads and highways.",
      "She says that cities can also implement their own Non-Motorised Transport Policy (NMTP) to create better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.",
      "\"At the moment, only a handful of cities in India have experimented with a NMTP but its time more cities step up to the plate,\" she adds.",

      "\"My mind was blown. The comments were flying in and people were asking for more.\"",
      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",

      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:13:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Some pioneers see it as opportunity but others fear the continent's creativity will be stripped for profit.",
    "story": [
      "Described as a virtual singer powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Mya Blue says: \"I am not the enemy, I am just a music lover exploring the different sounds of the world.\"",
      "Her Instagram account, where she makes this statement, has the tag line: \"I may not be human but I sing from my soul\" - and is the creation of Nigerian musician and producer Eclipse Nkasi.",
      "She features in his recently released remix of Joromi, a classic tune by the late Nigerian highlife artist Sir Victor Uwaifo.",
      "She and her creator want to calm the fears that many musicians the world over have about the impact of AI on the music industry.",
      "Earlier this year, for example, high-profile artists such as Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj called for a halt to the \"predatory\" use of AI tools which they say steal artists' voices.",
      "And given a lack of understanding about AI throughout Africa, and the fact that AI tends to rely on data sources collated in the West, there are concerns about how African music and cultural heritage will be affected.",
      "But there are many African artists and industry professionals who are excited about the possibilities this emerging technology offers.",
      "Indeed Nkasi says the fact that AI is in its infancy in Africa may be a boon for the continent.",
      "\"There is a huge threat, but just saying: 'Let\u2019s abolish AI' is not going to work - there are too many countries and people invested,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The best thing we can do is figure out better ways to use it.\"",
      "The 33-year-old is determined to be that pioneer and last year also produced the continent\u2019s first AI-powered music album Infinite Echoes.",
      "Nkasi says he has intentionally taken a manual and creative approach to using AI in his music, primarily using it to generate samples.",
      "\"My biggest drive with AI is its application, finding healthy ways to apply it. With each project it was important to find something that it did that moved the needle forward,\" he says.",
      "But while Nkasi is happy to experiment with the new technology, some see it as a threat to African culture.",
      "For Kenyan musician and producer Tabu Osusa, it heralds the risk of cultural appropriation - with AI passing off African sounds without acknowledging their source.",
      "This is because AI is able to quickly create new compositions by learning from existing music.",
      "\"My problem with AI is the ownership. Once you have taken some music from Ghana or Nigeria, who owns that music? How would you find out where the original creators are and ensure they are credited? It\u2019s theft for me through the backroom,\" Osusa told the BBC.",
      "\"Due to unregulated sampling methods by musicians, AI will enable recording company moguls in the West to make colossal sums of money while leaving some creatives in African villages to languish in abject poverty.\"",
      "This fear is reflected in a report released last year by Creatives Garage, a Kenya-based arts platform which worked in collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation to study the impact of AI on the East African nation\u2019s creative communities.",
      "It revealed that most Kenyan musicians were anxious that AI could lead to others benefitting from their creativity, says Bukonola Ngobi, research consultant at Creatives Garage.",
      "The study also warned that AI\u2019s power to store data might sound the death knell for the culture around traditional music.",
      "One musician even questioned whether recording and storing traditional sounds for AI to replicate might be a disincentive for local artists to continue to learn traditional instruments, Ngobi says.",
      "Osusa goes even further: \"In Africa we mostly don\u2019t study music, we are born with it. We live it. It\u2019s very spiritual. Music in Africa is always alive. It\u2019s so dynamic. That shouldn\u2019t be taken away from us.\"",
      "Yet the report did show that for those with access to tech devices, AI not only provided creative music development but also the chance to develop cheaper marketing and design services.",
      "Although this would be no help for emerging artists from Africa\u2019s poorer communities - and might raise the barrier to pursuing a music career, warned Ngobi.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have a laptop to start off with or you\u2019re a musician in an environment where there is no internet connectivity then how will you participate?\" she told the BBC.",
      "For those wanting to innovate, one of the problems Africa faces is the lack of data from the continent to dictate algorithms. Searches are often shaped by Western biases which decrease the accuracy and quality of work produced by AI for African musicians.",
      "For example, when Nkasi created Mya Blue using AI, he faced issues with her imagery - the artist presents as a Gen Z American girl with blue hair.",
      "\"AI is very limited in how it understands and perceives my space,\" he says.",
      "But the Nigerian musician views this as an opportunity for human contribution: \"The limits we Africans experience with AI can be a good thing.",
      "\"One can argue that right now, while AI can\u2019t give the very detailed African sound, there\u2019s still room for the guy who can play it. So I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re really fighting for when we consider that a problem.\"",
      "Fellow Nigerian Emmanuel Ogala, the boss of AI-powered company Josplay, definitely sees the opportunities for Africa.",
      "His company uses AI models to collate detailed metadata and intelligence to create archives of the continent\u2019s diverse music heritage.",
      "\"African music is really complex and it\u2019s one of the most understudied types of music,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This was reflected at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, when South African musician Tyla won the award for the Best Afrobeats song for her hit Water.",
      "During her acceptance speech she hit out against the tendency of Western award bodies to group all African artists under the umbrella of \"Afrobeats\" - a genre of music more associated with Nigeria and West Africa.",
      "\"African music is so diverse,\" she said. \"It\u2019s more than just Afrobeats. I come from South Africa. I represent amapiano. I represent my culture.\"",
      "Ogala feels AI would address such homogenisation and benefit African musicians by revealing to the world more of the continent\u2019s cultural diversity.",
      "\"A lot of the academics we speak to have knowledge that is very specific about a very small area of African music. You have to build for an African audience taking note of how fragmented our listening culture is. You just cannot humanly do that,\" he says.",
      "As AI continues to develop, there is consensus among African music artists, producers and researchers that there needs to be better financing.",
      "\"We need investment in the data infrastructure for the opportunities it presents to really be leveraged by people,\" says Ngobi.",
      "Ogala agrees and says that raising funds to develop his digital archive AI tool is difficult.",
      "\"We, the founders, have been funding the project out of our pockets because of our belief in the industry. If we put in place the fundamental building blocks, the industry will be a lot more viable than it is now.\"",
      "Added to this are the uncertainties around copyright legislation written for a pre-AI era which will need to be renegotiated. Copyright is already a huge issue for African artists whose music is often pirated, sold and played on the continent without them earning anything.",
      "These challenges aside, there is a growing realisation that unless the African music industry embraces the new technology, it is in danger of losing control of its talent and heritage.",
      "And Nkasi\u2019s Mya Blue certainly has big ambitions.",
      "During a Q&A on her Instagram, replying to a question about whether she could win a Grammy, she said: \"Who knows. As an AI [artist], I don\u2019t dream of trophies, but of resonating with hearts through music. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see a virtual artist on that stage?\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:38:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A new China-backed megaport in Peru may create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",
      "Like the rest of the world, Latin America is bracing itself for a bumpy four years - and if the US and China start a full-blown trade war, the region stands to get caught in the crossfire.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",

      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",

      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",

      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",

      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",

      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "summary": "Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's \"trifecta\" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",
    "story": [
      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",
      "Follow live updates on this storySeven things Trump says he will do in powerWhen does he become president again?Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",

      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",

The duo had eight Top 20 hits in the 1960s and '70s, and their TV series, \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" was a ratings bonanza.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

    "title": "Cher opens up about life with Sonny",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:13:14 -0500",
    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",
      "WATCH ANTHONY MASON'S EXTENDED INTERVIEW WITH CHER:",
      "Cher would go on to win an Oscar, for \"Moonstruck.\" But that's for part two of her memoir, which she still has to write.",
      "As for her music, she says she's got another album she wants to make. When? \"After I get rid of this book!\" she laughed. \"Because talking is harder on your voice than singing. And I want to record an album, and 78 is not exactly a time in your life when you want to. I hope I'm Tony Bennett!\"",

    "summary": "He's earned critical acclaim and award nominations for performances in \"Aftersun\" and \"Normal People.\" Now, Irish actor Paul Mescal, who's become a Gen Z heartthrob, is front-and-center of Ridley Scott's epic \"Gladiator II.\"",
    "story": [
      "Walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul Mescal said, \"There's this weird sensation about landing into the city \u2013 I don't know, it just makes me feel calm.\"",
      "The Irish actor was not going to get much of that calm on this stop, attending the Dublin premiere of \"Gladiator II.\" He was here to promote the highly-anticipated film. \"There's a little bit of really enjoying it, but part of it also hanging on for dear life,\" he said. \"Just the size is something that I haven't experienced before. I also just haven't led a huge amount of films.\"",
      "In \"Gladiator II,\" he plays Lucius, who learns (along with the audience) of his connection to Russell Crowe's character from the original 2000 blockbuster. Nearly 25 years later, director Ridley Scott is back with the sequel, out this week.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Gladiator II\" click on the video player below:",
      "What was it like for Mescal to be in the middle of such an epic film? \"I would say equally epic,\" he replied.",
      "The 28-year-old has already been nominated for an Oscar, playing a single dad in \"Aftersun,\" and an Emmy for his role in \"Normal People.\" Aside from the critical acclaim, that series turned him into a Gen Z heartthrob practically overnight.",
      "Ridley Scott says he was so impressed with Mescal that he cast the young actor after just a 30-minute zoom call.",
      "\"I got a phone call and they were like, 'You're going to be in \"Gladiator II,\"'\" Mescal recalled. \"That's kind of massively life-altering news to receive.\"",
      "It's that big? \"Yeah, of course it is,\" Mescal said. \"I think there's something that comes with the legacy of Ridley Scott.\"",
      "The first \"Gladiator\" won five Academy Awards, including best picture. In this incarnation, from Paramount Pictures (a division of CBS' parent company), Mescal stars alongside Denzel Washington.",
      "I asked, \"As an actor, are you taking mental notes when you work with someone like Washington?\"",
      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 01:17:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson are set to fight in a major professional boxing match tonight. Here's how to watch and what time the bout starts.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Jake Paul defeated Mike Tyson in their heavyweight fight in Dallas Friday night by unanimous decision. Read more here.",
      "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is set to take on YouTube sensation and current professional boxer Jake Paul in a highly anticipated heavyweight fight Friday night at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas. It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT) on Netflix. There were three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul were set to enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",

      "More data on COVID-19 vaccinations among seniors is expected later this fall, as the CDC analyzes records gathered from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Health officials had been hoping for improved COVID-19 vaccination rates this year, after authorities worked to launch this year's COVID shots closer to when the annual flu shot is also shipped out to doctor's offices and pharmacies.",
      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 06:56:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The budget carrier is trying to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed mergers.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a \"prearranged, streamlined\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 - when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel - Spirit's core business - have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 06:15:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Mike Tyson, a boxing legend, and Jake Paul, a social media legend, threw down Friday in Dallas. Financially, they both came out winners.",
    "story": [
      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",
      "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson: Everything you need to know\u00a0Mike Tyson says he's \"scared to death\" of upcoming Jake Paul fightJake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson: Everything you need to know",
      "Mike Tyson says he's \"scared to death\" of upcoming Jake Paul fight",
      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",
      "As\u00a0reported by USA Today, \"Tyson and his camp have not publicly responded to the offer.\"",
      "How much is the purse for the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight?",
      "The undisclosed purse is estimated by some to be as high as $80 million.",

      "Originally set to take place on July 20, the event was later postponed and rescheduled for November 15 after\u00a0Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles in May.",
      "As of early Friday evening, gate receipts at AT&T Stadium brought in $17.8 million in revenue, CNBC reported. Promotor MVP told the news outlet it expects more than 70,000 people fill the stadium, home to the Dallas Cowboys, which has a seating capacity of 80,000.",
      "Who do gamblers think will win the fight?",
      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",

      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",

      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",

      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency said it is already recruiting people to work on the new initiative to cut federal spending.",
    "story": [
      "The new Department of Government Efficiency, a group created by President-elect Donald Trump with the task of identifying ways to cut federal spending and headed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is already taking resumes.",
      "The request for job applicants was posted Thursday by the new X account for DOGE, which despite its heady mission isn't an official government department. In his statement on Tuesday announcing the effort, Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "It's unclear where the funding for DOGE will come from or the size of its budget, as well as whether Musk, the world's richest person, and Ramaswamy, who has an estimated net worth of $1 billion, will be paid for their efforts. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request for information.",
      "In the meantime, DOGE is starting to hire, according to the post on X, the social media service (formerly known as Twitter) owned by Musk. The account already has 1.2 million followers on the platform.",
      "What qualifications is DOGE looking for?",
      "The post didn't disclose the specific educational or career experience it is looking for in applicants. Instead, it described the kind of person they want to hire: \"We need super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\"",
      "It added that it doesn't want \"more part-time idea generators.\"",
      "How can people apply for a DOGE job?",
      "The post said that interested applicants should send a direct message, or DM, to the account with their CV, although the DOGE account wasn't open to messages when the job notice was first posted.",
      "\"Off to a great start. 'DM this account with an application',\" one person pointed out. \"DMs not open.\"",
      "Even after the DOGE account opened to direct messages, not all X users could send their resumes because only verified accounts or accounts followed by DOGE are able to DM the account. The DOGE account currently doesn't follow any other X users, and verification on the platform costs $84 a year.",
      "Only the \"top 1% of applicants\" will be reviewed by Musk and Ramaswamy, the DOGE account added. The post didn't specify how it will rank applicants.",
      "What does a DOGE job pay?",
      "The post didn't specify the salary range or benefits, but Musk said in a separate post that the 80-per-week job pays \"zero.\"",
      "\"Indeed, this will be tedious work, make lots of enemies & compensation is zero.   What a great deal!\" Musk wrote.",
      "What kind of response is the post receiving?",
      "A mix of pointed questions, humor as well as support from fans of Musk and Trump.",
      "\"Anything over 40 hours will be paid overtime right?\" one person posted on X in response to the job post.",
      "Others posted tongue-in-cheek \"qualifications,\" with one person writing, \"I'd love to join here's my resume:  - B+ in Science - JV soccer team (2 years) - Can eat >10 Oreos in one sitting  - Owner of several Dogecoins - Can burp the alphabet - Can run fast (top 25% of class).\"",

    "title": "Women suing over Idaho abortion ban said they felt like \"medical refugees\"",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",

The recalled rails sold online for about $40 on Amazon.com, eBay, Kohls.com, medicalkingusa.com and Target Plus from January 2020 through March 2024.",
      "People who purchased the products, which are made in China, should stop using them and contact Medical King for a repair kit or replacement bed rail, depending on the model.",

      "The recall is the ninth issued by the CPSC in the last three years. The recalls and two product warnings impacted more than 3 million units and are associated with serious injuries from head, neck or chest entrapment and 18 deaths, the federal agency stated.",
      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed. But these products \u2014 which are marketed as safety devices and sold by retailers including\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, as well as by\u00a0medical supply\u00a0stores \u2014 have shown to be unsafe for many, with thousands of elderly and disabled patients injured by them.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",
      "\"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,\" Rosner wrote. \"After a run of unseasonably hot autumn data, today's number cools fears of an imminent slowdown in the pace of rate cuts.\"",
      "Trump's policies and inflation",
      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win. But the president-elect's economic policies, which include a broad-based tariff on all imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary, economists say.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.6% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 some Wall Street experts have forecast.",
      "If that occurs, the Fed would likely slow its pace of rate cuts in order to battle ongoing elevated inflation, experts note.",

      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",

      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "summary": "Trump has indicated that the revelations about the accuser and payment have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Palatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Palatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News did not respond to an inquiry about when the network found out about Hegseth's settlement agreement.",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Palatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Palatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Palatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Palatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Palatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Palatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Palatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels. He has argued that the verdict should be overturned and the indictment dismissed on the basis, among other things, of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.",

    "summary": "A return to Madison Square Garden meant revisiting the place where a comedian caused an uproar at a Trump rally last month by likening Puerto Rico to a \"floating island of garbage.\"",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump walked out to a roaring standing ovation just ahead of the start of the UFC pay-per-view card at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, combining two things close to his heart: fierce battles inside the octagon and New York City.",
      "Trump was accompanied by UFC President Dana White and the pair headed to their cageside seats to Kid Rock's \"American Bad Ass.\"",
      "A return to Madison Square Garden meant revisiting the place where a comedian caused an uproar at a Trump rally last month by likening Puerto Rico to a \"floating island of garbage.\" Yet Trump continues to relish visits to New York, where he lived for decades, before moving to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "UFC aired a video package of Trump's road to reclaiming the White House, calling it, \"The great comeback in American History,\" while fans stood and applauded. Trump, wearing a red tie, pumped his fist toward the crowd when the video ended.",
      "The president-elect also had his clenched fists pumping back and forth and briefly danced to the Village People's \"YMCA\" just outside the cage. He later again thrust his fist skyward as \"Takin' Care of Business\" played.",
      "Elon Musk, picked by Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, joined the president-elect and White at the Garden, as did Robert Kennedy Jr., Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services in his incoming administration and Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump said last week he would nominate to be director of national intelligence. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was selected last week by the Republican conference to be their leader for the 119th Congress, was part of the entourage at the rally with Trump, Musk, RFK Jr. and Gabbard.",
      "Trump shook hands with the UFC broadcast team that included Joe Rogan. Rogan hosted Trump on his podcast for hours in the final stages of the campaign ahead of his election win last week. The announcers for the pay-per-view audience later declared, \"Festive doesn't even begin to describe\" the scene before later proclaiming, \"47's in the building. Let's go.\"",
      "The MSG crowd chanted \"USA! USA!\" right before the main card was about to start and then again throughout the action. After a year delay, Stipe Miocic is getting his shot at a third heavyweight championship reign when he battles current champion Jon Jones in the main event at UFC 309.",
      "Trump is a longtime UFC enthusiast and frequent attendee of major fights. He made promoting hypermasculine tones a signature of his campaign \u2014 as he looked to further widen the gap among male voters between himself and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump and his top supporters embraced alpha-male terms and often accentuated them with vulgar and demeaning language.",
      "While campaigning, Trump appeared frequently on podcasts, gaming platforms, and with key supporters who described a vote for Trump as a way to demonstrate true manliness. While Trump taped a podcast with Rogan, who himself has spoken about hypermasculinity, Harris failed to do a similar appearance, citing scheduling conflicts.",
      "Trump's son, Don Jr., also attended the fight.",
      "Also spotted at the rally with Trump was Yasser al Rumayyan, who has served under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to manage the oil-rich Saudi government's sovereign wealth fund, raising questions about potential financial conflicts of interest around Trump.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the nonpartisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS News on Sunday that \"while we don't have any idea about the nature of last night's interactions, Donald Trump being seen with someone who both has significant potential business interests with him and plays a significant role for an important foreign government illustrates the kinds of conflicts of interest Trump will face as president if he maintains his businesses.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim Himes told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"it was sort of not up for debate\" that there will be some conflicts of interest surrounding Trump.",
      "\"We saw Trump's first term, and the fact that that, you know, group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest,\" Himes said. \"And look, I don't know, Elon Musk, odd character, you know, you sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt, you know, space launch, to disrupt, you know, the auto industry and whatnot. But, you know, early reviews are not good.\"",
      "Except for a day trip to Washington this week to meet for nearly two hours with President Biden and separately address House Republicans, Trump has been spending his time since his Election Day victory at Mar-a-Lago. The club has hosted galas and conservative events throughout the week.",
      "Trump has been close to White for more than two decades.",
      "White hosted a 2001 UFC battle at Trump Taj Mahal, a former casino-hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Trump has frequently attended UFC matches since \u2014 including during his 2024 campaign. Trump has turned up at fights recently with famous entourages, including White, musician Kid Rock and former Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson.",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, he and White starred in a UFC video where the then-president was called the \"Combatant In Chief.\"",
      "As Trump has strengthened his grip on the national Republican Party over the last near-decade, White's personal political profile has grown exponentially. White spoke at the 2016 and 2020 Republican conventions, and when the party gathered in Milwaukee this past July. He also addressed the crowd at Trump's Florida victory party in the wee hours of the morning after Election Day.",
      "\"This is what happens when the machine comes after you,\" White said then. \"What you've seen over the last several years, this is what it looks like: couldn't stop him. He keeps going forward. He doesn't quit.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and senior staff picks are facing an uncertain future as his selections received mixed reviews in recent days even from fellow Republicans \u2014 and a handful sent shockwaves through Washington.",
      "Trump's selection for attorney general in former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. And Trump's pick for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and former Fox News anchor, has also sparked concerns, especially as an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has been made public. Additionally, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, doesn't have a background in intelligence and has drawn criticism for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut expressed astonishment about those questioning whether experience is necessary when asked about Gabbard, saying \"of course it's necessary.\"",
      "\"These people are manifestly unqualified, and you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run,\" Himes said.",
      "But Himes, the ranking Democrat on the the House Intelligence Committee, said that Gaetz's qualifications should also examined as well as the unreleased House Ethics Committee report.",
      "\"How is it that this is what we're focusing on?\" Himes said. \"Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.\"",
      "Gaetz' resignation from Congress after Trump's announcement came days ahead of a planned meeting and vote by the House Ethics Committee on whether to release a report on its investigation into Gaetz. Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that he would \"strongly request\" that committee withhold the potentially damaging report.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said Johnson makes \"an important point,\" warning that \"we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.\" But he stressed that the decision is the committee's alone, while noting that on Trump's selections, the Senate will exercise its advise and consent role through the confirmation process.",
      "\"President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government,\" Hill said.",
      "The Arkansas Republican outlined that when Trump came to office in 2017, there were members of his Cabinet who he had no personal relationship with or working background.",
      "\"He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration,\" Hill said.",
      "For his part, Himes offered some praise to some of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned Republicans in the Senate as the confirmation process plays out, saying that he understands \"what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump,\" but \"history is a harsh judge.\"",
      "\"The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump,\" Himes said.",
      "Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, stressed that vetting will be critical to the process moving forward, amid a New York Times\u00a0report\u00a0that Trump's team may bypass the typical FBI procedure and instead opt to use a private firm to vet his nominees who would be granted security clearances.",
      "\"It seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution,\" Gordon said, noting that a private firm won't have the same standards. \"I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that assists with presidential transitions, confirmed to CBS News that the Trump team hasn't signed paperwork that allows for security clearances and background checks, among other things, to occur. Gordon said she can't think of a \"good reason\" for the Trump team to forego the transition paperwork, saying that \"one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant.\"",
      "\"You're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base,\" Gordon said. \"To start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 15:27:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Dr. Deborah Birx\u200b, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Deborah Birx, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data,\" Birx said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday in a social media post that he'll nominate Kennedy to oversee the Health and Human Services Department, which encompasses multiple agencies and has a $1 trillion budget. The position has to be approved by the Senate, which, come January, will be controlled by Republicans, which could make the nomination process easier but is not a guarantee.",
      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" Trump wrote in a social media post last week. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "At an October rally, Trump\u00a0promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "Kennedy has criticized vaccines extensively in the past, including spreading misleading claims about their safety. He has also pledged to tackle an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy argues that a number of health issues in the U.S. have worsened, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity, which he blames on federal inaction.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under the Trump administration. Kennedy instead promises to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding. This data is expected to be addressed in upcoming confirmation hearings in Congress, a dialogue that Birx said she believes Americans will benefit from learning more about the differing perspectives on concerns surrounding vaccines.",
      "\"So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about,\" Birx said on Sunday.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, said at an event hosted by the Milken Institute last week ahead of Trump's decision that he hopes to find common ground with Kennedy and that he is also open to a conversation based on data.",
      "\"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" Marks said.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy will be in charge of a giant portfolio, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Birx said on Sunday that Kennedy, who ran for president this year but has never held public office and is already\u00a0facing criticism for his qualifications, would benefit from having an experienced team around him that come from the medical industry.",
      "\"So really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because \u2026\u00a0 HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments,\" Birx said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here.",
      "You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the speaker, who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade into the Ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member.",
      "Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself. But I think Speaker Johnson makes an important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "But that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise-and-consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug-fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz.",
      "Also, the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women. Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Like I say, I don't \u2013 I don't have \u2013 I don't personally know any details about the Ethics investigation or the allegations because I haven't \u2013 don't serve on that committee.",
      "But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee ask to see that report? And that may well be a decision that they take. And the Ethics Committee has a decision that they have to make. And Mike Johnson's expressed his view on that as well.",
      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",
      "These were high-confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I serve on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence.",
      "And I think, should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the president of the United States and to the two Intelligence Committees.",
      "So, again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make. But I remind you, Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it was John McCain who went in 2017. You went in 2023. I may have misspoken there on the year.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 so you believe the U.S. intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",
      "I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, no, these people are manifestly unqualified, and they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",

      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",

      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",

      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",

      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",

      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",
      "It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",
      "More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",

What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",

      "What's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food.",
      "Here's some of what he's said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I'm just going to tell the cereal companies, take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately.",
      "Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problems in our kids by giving them food that's poison. And I'm going to stop that.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can he actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think because of a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by Republican Congressman French Hill. He joins us from his district in Little Rock. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here. You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the Speaker who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade in to the ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member. Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself, but I think Speaker Johnson makes a important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee, but that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise and consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz. Also the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women, since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted and it was done, do you think if you were a Senate you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America- law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REP. HILL: I don't, I don't have, I don't, I don't personally know any details about the ethics investigation or the allegations, because I haven't, don't serve on that committee. But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee asked to see that report, and that may well be a decision that they take, and the ethics committee has a decision that they have to make, and Mike Johnson's expressed his view on on that as well. So as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do, advise and consent for all the nominations, and President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on \"Face The Nation\" about your work around Syria and Bashar Al Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited northern Syria, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017. The first lawmaker since John McCain to do so. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself, then publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times. These were high confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I served on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence. And I think should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the President of the United States and to the two intelligence committees. So again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make, but I remind you Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington. And the Senate, too, has their important job, and we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it was John McCain who went in 2017, you went in 2023 I may have misspoken there on the year, but so, you believe the US intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REP. HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "REP. HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years, and I've led the charge against the Assad regime. I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine, and you've been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support. There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the foreign affairs committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine. The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government. I believe that will go through in my judgment. But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries, have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now. One of the selections that the President-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on the job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process. He has a distinguished background in the military, and that counts for a lot, and I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership, will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process. But once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017 had cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think. They know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration. He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women and the Senate will have their advice and consent function well underway, and majority leader-to-be John Thune has said look, he'll be effective. He'll be speedy. He'll take it done, get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REP. HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it frankly here. I want to- I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just- who we just discussed in the previous segment, she was a democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "REP. HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that on a major news show the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land? Of course, it's necessary. You know, it's a little bit like our obsession right now with the ethics committee report on Matt Gaetz. You know- I mean, how is it that this is what we're focusing on? Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the ethics report. You know, it sort of reminds me of Al Capone in 1931. Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz. You know, well, what about this ethics report? So, these people are manifestly unqualified, and, you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that, you know, history is- is a harsh judge and- and I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. You know, talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney, or, you know, many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that. But history is a hard- hard judge and a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual. The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard, will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning. On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REP. HIMES: I do Margaret and just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the Attorney General and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security advisor. I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president. But these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy. So look, some of these nominations I think are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Last night, President elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive US government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China. Also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son in law, Jared Kushner, and they've held golf tournaments through the- one of their entities at Trump golf courses. Do you think that in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? I mean, this is, this is sort of not subject to debate. We saw Trump's first term, and the fact that that, you know, group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And look, all- I don't know, Elon Musk, odd character, you know, you sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt, you know, space launch, to disrupt, you know, the auto industry and whatnot. But, you know, early reviews are not good. I read his, you know, 12 point government waste manifesto, you know. And he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's, you know, that's part of the wasteful spending. Guess what? You got to pay interest on the debt. And so, you know, I'm skeptical that he has any clue. Look, I- I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that their heart surgeons and capable of running the United States. I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, you know, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal, but I'm going to reserve judgment",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you. I'm sure. On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping, and they met for a little less than two hours. The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government and copy information related to law enforcement actions. Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these- these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another. But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that, I promise you, they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So my hope is that the President made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable, and that he backs that up, and quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action. You know, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right? We're pretty good at hacking networks too, and I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it. But that we- that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. There will be some selections as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer, Elon Musk, yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEO Scott Bessent, a crypto currency skeptic, who is being considered for that role. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role. He is a crypto currency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury Secretary. You know, I would note that his first Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin- I certainly had disagreements with him on any number of topics, including desanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But you know, in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them. So we'll see what he does on Treasury. What I will say is that, look crypto, you know, it's a little bit like the Gaetz ethics report. Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives, and so I would just argue- and by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it, but this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know it's a technical issue. I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in and thank you for your time. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky governor Andy Beshear who joins us from Lexington. Good morning to you, governor. You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united- as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: I think there's absolute lessons that- that we can learn from Kentucky, a state where, last year, I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30. And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing, where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job, and whether they make enough to support their family. It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents, or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community. The goal here is to focus on all of those things, where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning, they don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there. So it's a- it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. We're going to take a break, come back and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us. More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy Secretary, if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling. Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of- of energy, regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day, we just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on, but especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables. So what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio. So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs, and we want to make sure that we never look down on and- and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that during the campaign. Mr. Trump vowed to undo the \"electric vehicle mandate,\" that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects. Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky that voted for President-Elect Trump by 30 points, and it's 10,000 EV related jobs on the line, and those are only growing. Go up to Ohio and look at that $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio and- and what that would mean in another state that voted for the president-elect. So you look at all of these jobs and jobs of the future that have come to what- what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue. Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-Elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are. And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game changing investments that- that have created a bright future here, and I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them, and not because I'm a Democrat, but because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them, and that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, 14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state. I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing, because the- the Vice President had 107 days, and she did her very best, and I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her. But what I know is, going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment, to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure, on their kids' education, just- just those everyday worries, and with this administration, at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees, it's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that- that we're where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues, or so to speak. Congressman Seth Moulton said, of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's \"speaking authentically,\" and said Democrats should do more of it. Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that- that all candidates should stand up for- for their beliefs and that- and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year, but- but I did two things. Number one, I talked about my why, for me, that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill. But the second thing is, the- the voters in my state knew the very next day, I was going to be working on jobs. I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years, we just cut the ribbon on. We've created two pediatric autism centers in- in Appalachia, so that people don't have to drive two hours. So it's- it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for- for your views, but- but the other piece is about that focus. Because remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day, and then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night, and then we're talking about jobs. We're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sue Gordon, principal deputy director of National Intelligence in the first Trump administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House. Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON: Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as President in the Oval Office. If this nominee to be Tulsi Gabbard becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know, and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the- I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird",
      "because it's always uncertain, and you are always making an assessment so that a decision-maker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so it's particular. And you- your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI, is to go in there and to be his principal advisor on intelligence. You're the first in, you're the last out. You cannot afford to, I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it, but Russia was in fact interfering, and he needed to hear that information. So do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person? If they believe they must be, they can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check to obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA, then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence. The New York Times is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidates. Then, when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets rather than go through that screening. What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It- you don't know why anyone should have to do it, because you know who you are. But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage, have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institution of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access, or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Because of leverage on them--",
      "SUE GORDON: -- It is, I mean, that's, I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests, and it just- and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that. So a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So CBS has also learned that, to date, the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings, so that someone's not walking in cold they're briefed and up to speed, along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS. Is there any good reason not to sign those papers, and what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah, I can't think of a- I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant. They need to be better, they need to be slimmer, they need to be more transparent, but they're not bummed. So you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially with some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean, intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So I can't think of a reason why that's not signed- signed, and to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence. She also has a history of statements, of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of us adversaries, Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the US intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence. I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when she comes out and says that she doubts it. She's skeptical. How is that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior advisor. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence sharing agreements so our allies and partners upon whom we rely, that Syria assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013That was sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you're talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America, but they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests, and whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill-informed of that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective, can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way. So I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden. Tulsi Gabbard, and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad, any good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths, and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners, and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that. there is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Deborah Birx, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in the first Trump administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the army, working on AIDS in Africa, at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC. Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE COVID RESPONSE COORDINATOR DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination, potentially of Robert F Kennedy Jr. HHS has a wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, oversees Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him, because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group, which you have to really bring together and, frankly, eliminate some of the duplication set between these agencies to really become more cost effective, and so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp- HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make. Well, what's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food, here's some of what he said:",
      "ROBERT F KENNEDY JR.: I'm just going to tell the- the cereal companies to take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately. 10 percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problem, and our kids are giving them food that's poison, and I'm going to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can you actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think because a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high. I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes, based on a household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America and so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans and we really start to tackle these issues one-by-one-by-one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady to get any of that done, and it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans and I think that's what people are calling for now. Europe did it years ago, and I think we're capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology, we can make food tasty without a lot of these additives, because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains. We're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his- the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine- vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline in vaccination?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1000 kids with autism, diagnosed with autism. Now it's three per 100. So every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads, they want to know why. So it's not good enough for us to just say vaccines don't cause autism. It's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation for autism, but what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines and there's no scientific basis for that conclusion as I understand it.",
      "DR. BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data. What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now, but what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical and I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what COVID vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my childhood vaccines do and don't, and they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child, like H Flu and pneumovax to protect their child from getting very serious illness, and we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters\u2013",
      "DR. BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013so much on this, which is why his past statements are being scrutinized. You worked on AIDS for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book, and said Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using \"accepted scientific proof.\" Do you agree with that assertion, and HIV and AIDS?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and AIDS progresses, HIV virus is the cause of AIDS, there's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to- it's asymptomatic for 10 years, and we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us. But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system. So by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T-cells that we use today in cancer. So a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas and I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If he's open to the data. Dr. Birx, thank you. We'll be right back."

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:23:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The Wall Street Journal columnist talks about her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" and why she believes Ronald Reagan would not recognize the Republican Party of Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "These days, you'll find Peggy Noonan in many places: in front of commencement crowds, at political round tables, and for the past quarter-century, in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal. But when she was just starting out in Washington, D.C., you could find Noonan at the Off the Record Bar, near her job at the White House. \"I would sit over there by myself, I would order a beer or a glass of wine, and I'd just quietly sit and read,\" she said.",
      "In 1984, Noonan joined President Ronald Reagan's staff, after working at CBS in New York. At first, she felt like an outsider in the buttoned-up West Wing, but soon became an acclaimed speechwriter. Early on, she wrote Reagan's moving speech for D-Day's 40th anniversary.",
      "Then, when the Challenger shuttle tragically exploded, Noonan was given a tough assignment: write Reagan's address to a distraught nation. \"I had a feeling of, that didn't work, nothing worked, because nothing was worthy of that moment; nothing was worthy of that day,\" she said. \"But then Frank Sinatra called \u2013 he called that night to the White House to say, 'Mr. President, you just said what needed to be said.' And Frank didn't call after every speech!\"",
      "By the late eighties, Noonan had cemented a reputation as a wordsmith, and Reagan turned to her for his farewell address:",
      "\"We made the city stronger, we made the city freer. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\"",
      "George H.W. Bush turned to Noonan, too, as he rallied Republicans on his way to the White House. \"You know, part of life is luck,\" she said. \"It was not lucky to follow dazzling Ronald Reagan and be plainer, seeming sturdy George H.W. Bush. But I believe history was not \u2013 certainly in his time \u2013 sufficiently fair to him.\"",
      "That opinion is one of many found in the pages of her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" a collection of her recent work (to be published Tuesday by Portfolio).",
      "Asked what her idea of America is today, Noonan replied, \"Big, raucous, troubled, frayed.\"",
      "Noonan's columns often delve into questions of character and leadership. \"What I do not perceive now is many politicians who are actually saying, Guys, this is not good for the country. We've been given this beautiful thing called America. Shine it up! Keep it going!\"",
      "Costa said, \"You have a lot of fun in this book, doing what you call taking the stick to certain people from time to time.\"",
      "\"I don't mind the stick at all,\" said Noonan. \"When I see something that I think is just awful, I love to get mad at it. I got mad at John Fetterman.\"",
      "\"You don't like that he's wearing shorts?\"",
      "\"It's okay with me that he wears shorts,\" she replied, \"but he is not allowed to change the rules of the U.S. Senate to accommodate him in his little shorts and hoodie because he enjoys dressing like a child.\"",
      "Noonan, now 74, grew up in the Democratic strongholds of New York and New Jersey. \"And I was very happy with that, because Democrats were cooler than Republicans,\" she said. \"Democrats were little Bobby Kennedy, and Republicans were, like, Dick Thornburgh!\"",
      "But in Reagan, she saw something fresh. \"You looked at him, you saw his confidence, and it made you feel optimistic,\" she said.",
      "The Gipper, of course, no longer dominates the Republican Party, and President-elect Trump's victory could transform the GOP even more in the coming years. \"In terms of policy, the Republican Party has changed by becoming, not a standard, usual conservative party, but a populist party,\" Noonan said. \"Its issues have changed very much. But also, the edge of anger and resentment and, I'm afraid, a little paranoia that is in the Republican Party now would be something that Reagan did not recognize.\"",
      "At the Off the Record Bar, the faces on the wall \u2013 caricatures of politicians of the past \u2013 and at the tables still catch her eye. For Noonan, it's all part of the story \u2013 America's, and her own.",
      "Costa said, \"In a way, you're still the writer in the corner watching everybody at the bar in Washington.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I like to watch them, she said. \"They're human, and you bring a little warmth to it, a little humor, and always bring your stick and smack them when you need to! It's kind of nice.\"",

    "story": [
      "In their final meeting, China's leader Xi Jinping told President Biden that his nation was \"ready to work with a new administration,\" as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take over.",
      "The two leaders gathered Saturday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, marking their first in-person meeting since\u00a0one they held\u00a0in Northern California last November. Mr. Biden was expected to urge Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "The White House said in a statement that Mr. Biden also \"expressed deep concern\" to Xi over China's \"continued support for Russia's defense industrial base.\"",
      "Without mentioning Trump's name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president's protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the U.S.-China relationship into another valley.",
      "\"China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,\" Xi said through an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Biden, meanwhile, spoke in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship has gone and reflected not just on the past four years, but on their long relationship.",
      "\"Over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have experienced ups and downs, but with the two of us at the helm, we have also engaged in fruitful dialogues and cooperation, and generally achieved stability,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Biden and Xi, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at Lima's Defines Hotel and Conference Center.",
      "During the meeting, according to the White House, Mr. Biden and Xi\u00a0were both in favor of resuming high-level military-to-military communications. This comes after the head of all U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific held a video call with a Chinese counterpart, the commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, in September, the first such call in years.",
      "Mr. Biden also addressed the China-Taiwan tension, the White House said. Xi has long claimed\u00a0that Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, belongs to China, and the Chinese military frequently stages exercises around Taiwan in a show of force.",
      "Mr. Biden \"reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" the White House said, and he \"called for an end to destabilizing PRC military activity around Taiwan.\"",
      "Meanwhile, there's much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60% tariffs on Chinese imports.",
      "Bobby Djavaheri, president of Los Angeles-based Yedi Houseware Appliances --- which manufactures its products in China --- told CBS News in an interview this week that such tariffs \"would decimate our business, but not only our business. It would decimate all small businesses that rely on importing.\"",
      "Trump has also proposed revoking China's Most Favored Nation trade status, phasing out all imports of essential goods from China and banning China from buying U.S. farmland.",
      "Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden administration officials will advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face.",

      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",

    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",
      "A supermoon happens when the moon is simultaneously full and at the part of its orbit that's closest to Earth, according to NASA. The moon's distance from Earth varies between around 221,457 miles and 252,712 miles.",
      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",
      "Supermoons appear larger than the average full moon. It's similar to the size difference between a quarter and a nickel, according to NASA. Supermoons are also about 16% brighter than an average moon.",
      "While all supermoons appear bigger and brighter than the average full moon, there is some variance. According to NASA, the November full moon will appear 6.2% bigger and 12.8% brighter than 2024's average full moon.",
      "When will the first supermoon of 2025 occur?",
      "Next year, expect three supermoons, starting in October, according to earthsky.org. There will be one on Oct. 7, 2025, followed by Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. Then the following new year will start with a supermoon on Jan. 3, 2026.",

      "A college student in Michigan received a threatening response during a chat with Google's AI chatbot Gemini.",
      "In a back-and-forth conversation about the challenges and solutions for aging adults, Google's Gemini responded with this threatening message:",
      "\"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"",
      "Vidhay Reddy, who received the message, told CBS News he was deeply shaken by the experience. \"This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day, I would say.\"",
      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs. The mother of a 14-year-old Florida teen, who died by suicide in February, filed a lawsuit against another AI company, Character.AI, as well as Google, claiming the chatbot encouraged her son to take his life.",
      "OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been known to output errors or confabulations known as \"hallucinations.\" Experts have highlighted the potential harms of errors in AI systems, from spreading misinformation and propaganda to rewriting history.",

      "Amazon Haul \u2014 whose name is a play on social media \"hauls,\" where people show off their purchases \u2014 focuses on selling items for $20 or less, or what Amazon calls \"crazy low prices.\" In a blog post, Amazon said the new service is available in its shopping app and mobile website.",
      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",
      "Items available on Amazon Haul on Wednesday included a three-pack of fuzzy socks for $4.99 and a quilted tote bag for $7.99. The merchandise ranged from clothing to household items such as silicone baking mats and throw pillows.",

      "What is the delivery time for Amazon Haul items?",
      "Longer than regular Amazon items, with the company noting that the goods are typically delivered within one to two weeks.",
      "What do the experts say?",
      "Amazon Haul could help the retailer appeal to younger shoppers, noted GlobalData's Saunders. But it also raises the risk that the low-cost shopping site could cannibalize sales from Amazon's main site, he added.",

    "summary": "Trump has indicated that the revelations about the accuser and payment have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Palatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Palatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News did not respond to an inquiry about when the network found out about Hegseth's settlement agreement.",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Palatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Palatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Palatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Palatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Palatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Palatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Palatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels. He has argued that the verdict should be overturned and the indictment dismissed on the basis, among other things, of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden urged leaders to work to protect the environment on Sunday, during a visit to the Amazon rainforest that marked the first such trip by any sitting U.S. president in history, warning that \"history is literally watching us now.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm proud to be here\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon rainforest\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to recommit to protecting the rainforests, like this one\" the president said. He added that \"the fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity for generations to come.\"",
      "Mr. Biden has made addressing climate change a key part of his policy agenda, approving legislation that reduces emissions, while setting the country on a path toward a transition to green energy. With the visit Sunday, the president\u00a0highlighted his commitment to combatting global deforestation and conserving forests as part of what the White House calls Mr. Biden's \"historic climate legacy.\"",
      "The president said the \"fight against climate change has been a defining cause of my presidency,\" touting rejoining the Paris Agreement, launching a global methane pledge and delivering on climate financing. The president announced during the visit that the U.S. has reached its goal of increasing its climate finance to over $11 billion a year, up from $1.5 billion when Mr. Biden took office. He also designated Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day, while the administration announces new conservation efforts including $50 million for the Amazon Fund, among other initiatives. And he cited the passage of the \"most significant climate change law in history,\" referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, which cuts carbon while creating clean energy investments and jobs.",
      "Mr. Biden outlined that leaders \"don't have to choose between the environment and the economy,\" urging that \"we can do both.\"",
      "Earlier Sunday, Mr. Biden took an aerial tour of the Amazon rainforest and he met local and Indigenous leaders and toured a local museum, before he's set to head to Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit with world leaders.",
      "The trip comes after the president has been attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru in recent days, where he met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.",
      "The historic visit comes as climate advocates have warned of the environmental consequences of President-elect Donald Trump's plans to rollback the Biden administration's efforts to combat climate change.",
      "The president addressed his term coming to an end in his remarks, saying he's leaving his successor and country with \"a strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.\"",
      "\"It's true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's underway in America, but nobody, nobody can reverse it,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The question now is\u00a0\u2014which government will stand in the way, and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and senior staff picks are facing an uncertain future as his selections received mixed reviews in recent days even from fellow Republicans \u2014 and a handful sent shockwaves through Washington.",
      "Trump's selection for attorney general in former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. And Trump's pick for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and former Fox News anchor, has also sparked concerns, especially as an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has been made public. Additionally, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, doesn't have a background in intelligence and has drawn criticism for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut expressed astonishment about those questioning whether experience is necessary when asked about Gabbard, saying \"of course it's necessary.\"",
      "\"These people are manifestly unqualified, and you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run,\" Himes said.",
      "But Himes, the ranking Democrat on the the House Intelligence Committee, said that Gaetz's qualifications should also examined as well as the unreleased House Ethics Committee report.",
      "\"How is it that this is what we're focusing on?\" Himes said. \"Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.\"",
      "Gaetz' resignation from Congress after Trump's announcement came days ahead of a planned meeting and vote by the House Ethics Committee on whether to release a report on its investigation into Gaetz. Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that he would \"strongly request\" that committee withhold the potentially damaging report.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said Johnson makes \"an important point,\" warning that \"we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.\" But he stressed that the decision is the committee's alone, while noting that on Trump's selections, the Senate will exercise its advise and consent role through the confirmation process.",
      "\"President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government,\" Hill said.",
      "The Arkansas Republican outlined that when Trump came to office in 2017, there were members of his Cabinet who he had no personal relationship with or working background.",
      "\"He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration,\" Hill said.",
      "For his part, Himes offered some praise to some of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned Republicans in the Senate as the confirmation process plays out, saying that he understands \"what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump,\" but \"history is a harsh judge.\"",
      "\"The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump,\" Himes said.",
      "Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, stressed that vetting will be critical to the process moving forward, amid a New York Times\u00a0report\u00a0that Trump's team may bypass the typical FBI procedure and instead opt to use a private firm to vet his nominees who would be granted security clearances.",
      "\"It seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution,\" Gordon said, noting that a private firm won't have the same standards. \"I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that assists with presidential transitions, confirmed to CBS News that the Trump team hasn't signed paperwork that allows for security clearances and background checks, among other things, to occur. Gordon said she can't think of a \"good reason\" for the Trump team to forego the transition paperwork, saying that \"one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant.\"",
      "\"You're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base,\" Gordon said. \"To start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here.",
      "You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the speaker, who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade into the Ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member.",
      "Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself. But I think Speaker Johnson makes an important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "But that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise-and-consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug-fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz.",
      "Also, the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women. Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Like I say, I don't \u2013 I don't have \u2013 I don't personally know any details about the Ethics investigation or the allegations because I haven't \u2013 don't serve on that committee.",
      "But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee ask to see that report? And that may well be a decision that they take. And the Ethics Committee has a decision that they have to make. And Mike Johnson's expressed his view on that as well.",
      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",
      "These were high-confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I serve on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence.",
      "And I think, should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the president of the United States and to the two Intelligence Committees.",
      "So, again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make. But I remind you, Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it was John McCain who went in 2017. You went in 2023. I may have misspoken there on the year.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 so you believe the U.S. intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",
      "I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women, and the Senate will have their advice-and-consent function well underway.",
      "And Majority-Leader-to-be John Thune has said, look, he will be effective\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: \u2026 he will be speedy, he will take it done \u2013 get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, no, these people are manifestly unqualified, and they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, the speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning.",
      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",
      "He also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and they have held golf tournaments through the \u2013 one of their entities at Trump golf courses.",
      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Guess what? You have got to pay interest on the debt. And so I'm skeptical that he has any clue.",
      "Look, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that they're heart surgeons and capable of running the United States.",
      "I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal. But I'm going to reserve judgment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you, I'm sure.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping. And they met for a little less than two hours.",
      "The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government, and copy information related to law enforcement actions.",
      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So we will see what he does on Treasury.",
      "What I will say is that, look, crypto\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 it's a little bit like the Gaetz Ethics report.",
      "Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so I would just argue \u2013 and, by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. It's a technical issue I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in. And thank you for your time.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who joins us from Lexington.",
      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",
      "It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",
      "More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Governor, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group. What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",

You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",
      "There's no real understanding of how these people can do this, but you can certainly understand why. An emotional Vivek Puri said, \"It's nice to be good at something.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 09:25:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The former president proudly wears the title of \"citizen,\" which is also the title of his new book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House.\" He talks about making a difference outside of elected office, and the prospects of a second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "They don't play \"Hail to the Chief\" when President Bill Clinton shows up anymore, but there is an equally welcome sound he still hears all the time. \"We love you!\" shouts one bystander in Harlem.",
      "Here, a walk through the streets with Clinton feels a lot like a victory lap. The former president set up shop here shortly after he left office. Back then, he was only 54, newly unemployed, but determined to use his influence, contacts and know-how to make a difference as a private citizen.",
      "He even said so in his final address to the nation: \"In the years ahead, I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of President of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen.\"",
      "In the 24 years since he made that speech, Citizen Clinton has accomplished enough to fill several lifetimes \u2013 and the pages of a new book: \"Citizen: My Life After the White House\"\u00a0(to be published Tuesday by Knopf).",
      "Asked what he was most proud of that he'd done in your time out of the White House, Clinton replied, \"I think the thing I'm most proud of is that I proved that you can make a big difference as a private citizen.\"",
      "By any measure, he's done that. Through his Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, which partners business leaders with nonprofits, he's helped fund projects worldwide \u2013 to name a few, a program to help combat HIV/AIDS in South Africa, and a massive clean water project in Rwanda. Closer to home, his foundation helped with everything from the energy-saving retrofit of the Empire State Building in New York, to fighting drug overdoses in the heartland, to an upgrade of street lights in Los Angeles. They also helped fund construction jobs to rebuild crumbling infrastructure.",
      "\"We raised $16 billion from union pension funds to put people to work,\" he said. \"It was the biggest in the country at the time. That's what I'm proud of, 'cause I think people are happy when they do things that actually make things better.\"",
      "The president also hit the road for the Harris-Walz ticket in the final weeks of the campaign, and says he was disappointed, but not entirely surprised, by the result.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think part of the issue is that America is just not ready for a female president?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" Clinton replied. \"I think in some ways we've moved to the right as a reaction to all the turmoil. And I think if Hillary had been nominated in 2008, she would've walked in, just like Obama did.\"",
      "\"Has the country changed?\"",
      "\"Well, I think all these cultural battles that we're fighting make it harder in some ways for a woman to run.\"",
      "\"So, you think it has more to do with party than gender?\"",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"Although I think it would probably be easier for a conservative Republican woman to win.\"",
      "\"Than a Democrat woman?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. Because, I mean, that's what Maggie Thatcher did,\" said Clinton. \"But I still think we'll have a female president pretty soon.\"",
      "\"How soon? Within your lifetime?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah. Well, I don't know how long I'm gonna live. You're askin' an old man that question!\" he laughed. \"I hope I'm around for the next time. But now it's President Trump's turn in the barrel. It depends on what he does and how it plays.\"",
      "We spoke this past week as the president-elect was in the process of naming his new cabinet, shaking up Washington, D.C., and beyond.",
      "I asked, \"Are the guardrails off?\"",
      "\"Well, there's no obvious guardrail,\" Clinton replied. \"The Senate's shown some indigestion about some of these suggested appointments. We'll see what happens there. You know, somewhere along the way, [Trump will] have to think about whether, at this chapter of his life, he still thinks the most important thing is to have unquestionable domination, 'cause that's not what a democracy is about.\"",
      "\"So you're saying President Trump might have a change of heart?\"",
      "\"He might. I was raised in the Baptist Church. I believe in deathbed conversions! I think you can't give it up,\" Clinton said. \"But I think the rest of us just have to be diligent, watch the signs, and be willing to stand up for what we think is right, even if they take a piece outta our hide.\"",
      "In his book, the president writes candidly about his health issues, including his battle with weight. But he couldn't resist stopping into the famed soul food restaurant Sylvia's, if only for a cup of coffee.",
      "I asked, \"If you were eating here, what would you get?\"",
      "\"In the middle of the afternoon? I would get some piece of pie.\"",
      "\"I know you talk about this in your book. You have to watch your diet a little bit now?\"",
      "\"A lot,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbelievable how low your metabolism gets.\"",
      "If he's candid about his health, he's just as open about past controversies. Clinton writes about Monica Lewinsky, applauding her recent work on bullying.",
      "Why make a point of doing that? He said, \"Because I thought I needed to say something about it, and I wanted to be as helpful as I could to let her turn the page. I think she should be given a chance to build a life that is about her and the future, and not, you know, being whiplashed into an old story.\"",
      "So, while he's mindful of the past, Bill Clinton keeps moving forward, making connections big and small, still trying \u2013 and often succeeding \u2013 in his bid to change the world.",
      "\"I don't mind it when people jump on me; I just talk to 'em,\" he said. \"And I don't turn 'em all. You don't have to turn everybody; you just got to get enough.",
      "\"We just all need to loosen up and get back in the game. \u2026 There's one other thing, and I say this in the book many times: We all keep score. You've been doing this for a long time. You're keeping score in your mind about this interview compared to 15 others you've done. And I think the way I keep score is: Are people better off when you quit than when you started? Do children have a brighter future? And are we coming together instead of being torn apart? So, for me, it's enough if I can answer yes to those three things.",
      "\"I know there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics,\" said Clinton. \"And I have no interest in being an armchair quarterback except to help my team perform better. And I think they have enormous talent. So, I wish 'em all well, and I'll try to help. But meanwhile, I'm gonna just suit up and do what I'm doing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 After more than a year of bombing and homelessness, Gazans are looking to a new administration in Washington for help. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory has raised hopes and fears among the five million residents of the Palestinian territories \u2014 the warn-torn Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Gaza resident Rakan Abdul Ahman told CBS News he wants the new U.S. president to make Israel end the war.",
      "\"We've witnessed enough killing of women and children,\" he said. \"I'm looking for Trump to end the suffering in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In the eyes of Ahmed Harb, a Gazan journalist, the incoming Trump administration faces a real test. In his victory speech, Trump said he'd end wars. Harb hopes that means the one in Gaza.",
      "\"I hope he was telling the truth,\" he told CBS News, adding: \"But he shouldn't stop the war at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "That is the big worry for Palestinian politicians, too, including Mustafa Bargouti. Still a practicing physician, he leads the Palestinian National Initiative, a party that champions democratic government for all Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "The question, Bargouti said, is \"how you stop the war? Do you stop it by annexing occupied territories? By ethnically cleansing Palestinians? Or do you stop the war by forcing Israel to end its illegal policy of settling Israelis on our land?\"",
      "Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group's massacre of some 1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, has diverted international attention away from growing violence in the West Bank by Israeli settlers determined to encroach on what has been Palestinian land.",
      "In 2023, there were a record number of so-called outposts \u2014 makeshift Jewish encampments set up by settlers in what has been Palestinian land. They can be as simple as a couple of shipping containers that function as a de-facto Jewish real estate claim. The settler groups then lobby Israel's courts and government to retroactively make the outposts official Jewish settlements.",
      "Right-wingers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet support Jewish expansion, including the outposts, in the West Bank. They openly advocate driving the Palestinians out, and annexing the whole area for Israel. Not only would that be illegal under international law, Bargouti warns that it would also lead to even more conflict.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" he said. \"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that.\"",
      "Palestinians everywhere are watching Trump's choosing of pro-Israeli officials for key positions with dismay, especially Mike Huckabee, the president-elect's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is on the record as saying, \"there's really no such thing as a Palestinian.\"",
      "\"When you hear a person like Huckabee saying there is no occupation, and there are no settlements, they are just Israeli communities\u2026. he might as well say there is no international law,\" said Bargouti.",
      "During Trump's first term, he opposed the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, in 2020, proposed what he called \"the deal of the century\" \u2014 a template for a long-sought Palestinian state.",
      "Under his proposal, the new state would have been a scattering of isolated Palestinian lands, each surrounded by Israel. The plan was rejected by both the Palestinians and by Jewish settlers and, since then, both sides have dug in.",
      "Even if the new Trump administration revives some version of its proposal for a Palestinian state, it will face Palestinians and their Arab allies whose resolve has only been hardened by a devastating year of war in Gaza that has killed almost 44,000 people.",
      "On the Israeli side, hardliners in Netanyahu's government oppose any form of Palestinian sovereignty. Netanyahu himself has flatly rejected the prospect repeatedly.",
      "Bargouti, however, sounded ready for the fight.",

      "The weather system made landfall late Thursday about 105 miles west-northwest of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Honduras-Nicaragua border.",
      "After reaching Belize, Sara is then expected to turn northwesterly toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, though forecasters said it probably will not reemerge into the Gulf after crossing the Yucatan.",
      "\"Little change in strength is anticipated until landfall on Sunday, with dissipation expected over the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula by early Monday,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Rain-soaked Honduran residents were on edge Saturday as the conditions brought back memories of the disastrous November 2020 hurricane season, when two powerful storms passed through the region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and causing widespread damage.",
      "Standing on a riverbank, Carlos Canelas, 48, acknowledged many residents like his mother had ignored official warnings to evacuate the Flor de Cuba neighborhood of San Pedro Sula. By Saturday morning, the 77-year-old woman was cut off from the rest of the city because the river crossing collapsed and remained home with her 35-year-old special-needs son.",
      "\"That is why I did not go to work, but there is little or nothing I can do,\" he said. \"I can cross the river swimming, but how do I get my mother out?\"",
      "The storm, however, did not stop a CONCACAF Nations League soccer match Friday in San Pedro Sula. Under heavy rain, Mexico lost 2-0 to Honduras.",
      "In November 2020, storms Eta and Iota passed through Honduras after initially making landfall in Nicaragua as powerful Category 4 hurricanes. Northern Honduras caught the worst of the storms with torrential rains that set off flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands. Eta alone was responsible for as much as 30 inches of rain along the northern coast.",
      "The Hurricane Center on Saturday said storm surge could raise water levels along Honduras' immediate northern coast areas by as much as 3 feet above normal.",
      "\"Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" according to the center. \"A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara crosses the coast of Belize.\"",
      "Sara, the 18th\u00a0named storm\u00a0of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season, is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",

      "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders could be triggered by air pollution, including the type emitted in car exhaust, a new study suggested \u2014 though it had some limitations.",
      "The review, led by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, analyzed multiple studies related to autism and cellular activity. The findings were published in the journal Brain Medicine.",
      "The researchers focused on four specific types of particles that make up air pollution: fine particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3).",
      "MELANIA TRUMP SAYS BARRON AUTISM RUMORS CAUSED \u2018IRREPARABLE DAMAGE\u2019",
      "They also investigated four different ways in which these particles could impact the fetus.",
      "Those four ways were neuroinflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress (an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants that causes cell damage), epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA) and disruptions to certain neurotransmitters, according to the study.",
      "Lead study author Haitham Amal, PhD (center) is an associate professor at The School of Pharmacy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is pictured with his research team. (Igor Fabrov)",
      "\"Increasing air pollution may significantly raise the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASD, due to gene-environment interactions,\" lead study author Haitham Amal, PhD, an associate professor at The School of Pharmacy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.",

      "The risk is highest during times of accelerated development, such as prenatal and early childhood periods, according to Amal, who is also a visiting professor at Boston Children's Hospital within Harvard Medical School.",
      "\"The brain starts developing at birth and continues to develop until the mid 20s,\" Georges Ghacibeh, M.D., a neurologist at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital. He was not involved in the study.",
      "The risk is highest during times of accelerated development, such as prenatal and early childhood periods, the researcher said. (iStock)",
      "\"During the early years, from conception until about age 5, the brain undergoes the most changes and therefore is more susceptible to the impact of external factors,\" added Ghacibeh.",
      "In a previous study published in 2023, the same research team found that nitric oxide (NO), which is one of the particles in air pollution, is a \"key pathological factor in autism,\" Amal noted.",
      "The brain is most susceptible to external factors from conception until age 5, experts say.",
      "Ghacibeh agreed that air pollution could increase autism risk.",
      "\"Chemicals inhaled by a pregnant mother or a young child, if they enter the bloodstream and make it to the brain of the fetus or developing child, can affect various metabolic pathways, either by interfering directly with certain chemical reactions inside the cells, or by reducing the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "In the U.S., autism affects one in 36 children, or about 2.3%, as of 2024, according to statistics from the CDC. (iStock)",
      "This can interrupt the process of normal brain development, according to the doctor, causing brain cells to lose their normal function.",
      "\"The mechanism would be similar to the effect of certain medications ingested during pregnancy that can lead to developmental delay or autism in the child,\" Ghacibeh said.",
      "Study doesn\u2019t prove cause",
      "Amal acknowledged that the study had some limitations.",

      "Ghacibeh agreed, noting that epidemiological studies prove association but not causality.",
      "\"In other words, if two phenomena occur simultaneously, such as high levels of air pollution and a rise in autism, this does not necessarily prove that one caused the other \u2014 it just means that both phenomena occurred at the same time. It is possible that additional, unknown factors might have played a role as well,\" he said.",
      "Air pollution affects approximately 131.2 million people, or 39% of the U.S., as noted in the 2024 American Lung Association's State of the Air report.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Future research should aim to better understand pollution\u2019s effects on \"genetically susceptible individuals\" and to find ways to protect those at greatest risk, according to Amal.",

      "Gaetz negotiated with Mr. Trump to become Attorney General on a flight to Florida \u2013 just hours after the incoming President spoke to House Republicans in Washington last week. Mr. Trump then made Gaetz his pick and the Florida Republican resigned.",
      "What wasn\u2019t known at the time was that the House Ethics Committee was on the precipice of releasing a report investigating allegations of \"sexual misconduct\" and \"illicit drug use\" by Gaetz. Gaetz stopped cooperating with the House investigation over the summer. The FBI probed Gaetz for years \u2013 but dropped its inquiry in February.",

Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued. That's not unique to this case,\" said Guest.",

      "It\u2019s possible the Senate Judiciary Committee could subpoena the report from the Ethics Committee. And as suggested earlier, there is a way to dislodge the report from the panel via a vote on the House floor. Such a scenario would put a lot of Republicans in a tough spot. They may fear that voting to release the report could put them on the wrong side of incoming President Trump. That\u2019s to say nothing of the prospective Attorney General.",
      "But Gaetz isn\u2019t liked by his former House colleagues. In fact, some Republicans may have more disdain for the former Florida Congressman than Democrats. That\u2019s partly because it was Gaetz who single-handedly triggered a vote last year to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

They go as far as to change the contact information of the email sender to something legitimate like an actual helpdesk or IT department or business.",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device. If you click on a link that's provided in the email, it might take you to a website that will collect your personal and financial information or download malware or viruses to your device.",

Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",

      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",

      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 21:36:33 -0500",
    "summary": "The Menendez brothers trial gets a brand-new prosecutor in Nate Hochman when he assumes the role of Los Angeles County DA next month. Here&apos;s what that means for fans of the true crime case.",
    "story": [
      "District Attorney-elect Hochman joined 'Fox & Friends' after the win, saying voters favored his 'down the middle' approach over Gascon's 'extreme pro-criminal policies.'",
      "New Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman has a message for fans of Erik and Lyle Menendez: don\u2019t rush to judgment as their Dec. 11 resentencing hearing approaches.",
      "Hochman, 60, told The Daily Beast he thinks many fans of the Menendez brothers' true-crime series don\u2019t fully understand the case.",
      "The Menendez brothers, now 53 and 56, are serving life without parole at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, after they were convicted of murdering their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, with a shotgun in 1989.",
      "Hochman, who served in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general during former President George W. Bush's administration, says the sudden interest in the Menendez brothers is likely because of a Netflix series and documentary about their crimes. To stay focused, the incoming DA said he hasn\u2019t watched either.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS ASK CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM FOR CLEMENCY",
      "Nathan Hochman at the Los Angeles district attorney candidates forum at Pacific Palms Resort.\u00a0 (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to see them,\" he said. \"What\u2019s the point? I\u2019d rather read the book.\"",
      "Hochman admitted he only remembers bits and pieces of the case from 30 years ago, but that\u2019s why he plans to carefully dig into the facts. The Menendez case is a \"high priority,\" Hochman told The Daily Beast.",
      "Hochman added, \"Any time a particular case gets this level of attention, it\u2019s even that more important to get it right.\"",
      "Hochman, Republican, decisively won the seat earlier this month, earning 61.46% of the vote, while Democrat incumbent George Gasc\u00f3n had 38.54%, according to data released from the Los Angeles County registrar\u2019s office. He says he won\u2019t be swayed by celebrity endorsements, including from personality Kim Kardashian and actor Cooper Koch, who played Erik Menendez in the Netflix series.",
      "Before leaving office, Gasc\u00f3n asked a judge to reduce the brothers\u2019 charges to manslaughter, which some say was a move to help his reelection campaign.",

(Vince Bucci/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Some superfans also hoped that the brothers could be released as soon as Thanksgiving after filing a habeas corpus petition in May of last year with a hearing scheduled for Nov. 26, but their resentencing hearing is set for December 11. Hochman is expected to request an extension from the judge.",
      "The Menendez family has called for the brothers\u2019 immediate release, asking to skip the parole process. But even if a judge agrees to resentencing, parole could still take a year. On top of that, Gov. Gavin Newsom could block their release.",
      "Another possibility is clemency from Newsom. On the case, he said, \"What matters are the facts. What matters is justice and fairness. Not treating them any worse because they\u2019re celebrities, not treating them any better.\"",
      "The brothers admitted to killing their parents, but claimed it was self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father. Prosecutors argued that wasn\u2019t true, saying the brothers killed for money.",

You are staring at these photos, staring back at you.

      "The series covers some of the 175 kill orders that Miller\u2019s team turned over to police, The Hollywood Reporter said. According to the outlet, that information has led to 32 convictions and over 150 years of prison time.",
      "\"Some of these kill orders would go on, page after page,\" Miller recalled. \"The instructions were really practical, like, \u2018The target tends to leave at this time in the morning. This is their car and this is where they work. Be careful, they have a dog.\u2019 There were lots of instructions about how to get the hit done.",
      "\"It also moved to justifications for why the person needs to die,\" he shared. \"We had to comb through these carefully because they were our best clues as to who might be taking out the order. \u2026 It is a very difficult thing to do, peering straight into the mind of someone who wants \u2026 someone else killed. And that is not a place that I think most people have to confront in their day-to-day lives.\"",
      "Carl Miller, a U.K.-based tech journalist, is the host of \"Kill List.\" (Wondery)",
      "The saga began in 2020 when Chris Monteiro, an IT technician and hacker, was browsing the site and found a security vulnerability that gave him complete access to it, The Guardian reported. According to the outlet, he found a \"kill list,\" a spreadsheet listing hundreds of people from all over the world whom clients wanted eliminated.",
      "\"We were intending to do a podcast, which was supposed to look back at dark net assassinations over the last few years,\" Miller explained. \"We didn\u2019t anticipate it, but Chris began to send us these live kill orders. Most of the story of the podcast is us scrambling to try and deal with all of that, trying to make sense of it and trying to react in a responsible way.\"",
      "With Monteiro\u2019s help, Miller was able to review private messages between clients and the website\u2019s owner. According to The Guardian, the website was a scam run by a Romanian crook who had no intention of providing the sinister services. Instead, the fraudster pocketed the payment.",

      "\"People believed the site was real, and it isn\u2019t,\" Miller explained. \"The hitman-for-hire site is not sending out assassins. It has no interest in sending out assassins. The Romanian cybercriminals have an interest in taking the money from the perpetrators \u2014 that\u2019s all. And we realized that very early on. As soon as we started intercepting these kill orders, we could read that none of the assassinations were happening.",
      "\"If they were real assassins, they were the most incompetent assassins you would ever come across,\" Miller added. \"They kept getting lost, they\u2019d lose their gun, the target would be too well protected or they would be in a different country. These were just beyond incompetent because there was no hitman. The Romanian cybercriminals were just trying to extort as much money as they could. And, then, they would just ignore the person from then on.",

One of those employees tried to kill the other one. The order was only for about 100 pounds ($126.38). That\u2019s the smallest that we saw. But then there was a U.S. doctor who paid over $50,000 for the hit. We saw everything in between. There were a lot of orders in the $10K-$40K range.\"",

      "\"I think they were worried that I was mad,\" said Miller. \"Once they were convinced that I was not, in fact, mad, they took it seriously. But the problem was that these orders were spread all over the world. We had cases in Russia, Finland, Spain, the U.S. \u2026 We were laughed out of a police station in Spain. That\u2019s on tape, police laughing at us.",
      "\"In America, police told one of the targets that he thought we were the scammers. In Switzerland, the police told one of the targets they suspected we were running the site for a story. There was no evidence that any of that was true.",
      "\"I would say that was probably the lowest and most difficult time in this whole investigation for us.\"",
      "When Miller and his team felt they weren\u2019t being taken seriously by police, they reached out to the targets themselves in hopes of warning them. They were also willing to provide the targets with whatever they needed to inform law enforcement.",

      "\"It\u2019s very unusual to step out of a normal role as a journalist,\" said Miller. \"Journalists report. They wait. They watch. But they don\u2019t step in. And I think if there was any other way of us intervening in another way that would have kept these people safe, we would have done that first. But we could not think of any other way that would\u2019ve been effective. \u2026 You had the Romanian cybercriminals that were trying to stay hidden from us, but you also had police who weren\u2019t believing us. \u2026 That\u2019s why we did it.\"",
      "At first, Miller was worried about reaching out to the targets, wondering if those who would want them taken out would panic and \"take matters into their own hands.\" He also didn\u2019t want those on the receiving end to \"go into a panic attack.\"",

He would park his car, get out of his car and get ready to fight. He was always waiting for someone to jump out of the bushes. Whenever he would shovel snow, every time a car passed by, he would rush back inside his house. \u2026 I think once it does sink in, it\u2019s very difficult for people to find ways of feeling safe again.\"",

      "Fearing that measures from the coming Trump administration might be harmful to Mexico, Sheinbaum and other officials have expressed a commitment to maintaining a positive bilateral relationship while emphasizing Mexico\u2019s sovereignty. At a recent press conference, she reassured Mexicans that there is \"no reason for concern\" regarding the election outcome, indicating confidence in the stability of bilateral relations. \"We will work with dialogue and respect for our sovereignties,\" she said.",
      "Rodrigo Montes de Oca, a scholar at the Baker Institute Center for the U.S. and Mexico, talked to Fox News Digital and said that \"the bilateral relationship will no longer be reduced to a single issue but will be addressed in a broader manner.\" He explained that \"former President L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 AMLO, was very skillful in being able to concentrate the entire bilateral relationship on a single issue: immigration.",

Now with the coming Trump administration, everything is going to be much more complex because they will not only focus on immigration but also on trade and security. That is why Trump went so far as to say during the campaign that if Mexico did not cooperate on these issues, he would make public the U.S. government's intelligence information on politicians in Mexico who are related to drug cartels. The relationship is going to be approached in a more comprehensive way. I don't see that the Mexican government is preparing for that.\"",
      "With Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and more immigration controls, Mexico is expected to strengthen its immigration policies. This may involve increased enforcement at its southern border and expanded cooperation with U.S. authorities to manage migration flows effectively. Such measures aim to address U.S. concerns while upholding Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and humanitarian commitments.",
      "Sheinbaum has continued Mexico\u2019s existing strategies to manage and discourage migrant caravans traveling toward the United States. These measures include the deployment of the National Guard and other security forces to intercept and disperse migrant groups at the southern border. This approach aims to prevent large caravans from forming and progressing northward.",

      "Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexican exports, particularly in the automotive sector, have prompted Mexico to consider reciprocal measures. Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard indicated that Mexico might impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports if such U.S. tariffs are enacted, emphasizing the potential economic repercussions for both nations.",

      "Mexican Congressman Ra\u00fal Torres told Fox News Digital: \"Claudia Sheinbaum's administration will have to reinforce the security strategy on the southern border by deploying the National Guard and strengthening the presence of the National Migration Institute. Likewise, she must change the narrative and a new way of negotiating with the U.S. given the upcoming negotiation of the USMCA trade deal. She must put at the center an economic agenda to empower Mexicans in the United States, whose weight is increasing every day since many of them open businesses, generate jobs and voted for Donald Trump.\"",

      "President Joe Biden proudly called himself the most pro-labor president in American history, but working-class voters moved further than ever from their traditional home in the Democratic Party in this year\u2019s election, leading some to rethink their approach to winning working-class voters.",
      "While unions say their extensive organizing efforts helped Democrats largely hold the line with their members \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 support among union households this year was slightly down from Biden\u2019s in 2020, according to NBC News exit polling \u2014 the party\u2019s erosion among working-class voters more generally is alarming.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the party has fully embraced, and hasn\u2019t for decades, really, working-class people,\u201d said Brent Booker, the general president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. \u201cWe have to deconstruct and reconstruct the Democratic Party if they\u2019re going to be the party of working people.\u201d",
      "Union membership has cratered over the past 50 years, so union leaders say there is only so much they can do in a world where 9 in 10 workers are not unionized and larger trends are cleaving workers from the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t communicate with every nonunion laborer. We can only communicate with a portion of our members,\u201d said Booker, who thinks Democrats could have performed better with a fierier populist message on the economy and a cooler one on cultural issues that make some of his members feel like Democrats are out-of-touch elitists. \u201cA lot of our members own guns. A lot of our members hunt.\u201d",
      "Booker said that when he toured job sites this year, he heard about inflation, immigration and the demise of the Keystone Pipeline, which would have created jobs for his members but was killed for environmental concerns \u2014 all issues that played to the GOP\u2019s favor.",
      "Defining the working class is tricky in a postindustrial economy. But whether they are measured by income or educational attainment, President-elect Donald Trump won working-class voters overall while he made strong gains among nonwhite working-class voters like Hispanics and Asian Americans.",
      "As recently as 2012, non-college-educated voters were splitting their votes evenly or even slightly in favor of Democrats. This year, they broke 2-to-1 for Trump over Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. And while former President Barack Obama won 57% of people making $30,000 to $49,999 in 2012, Trump won that income bracket 53%-45% this year.",
      "As educated professionals who used to vote Republican recoiled from Trump, Democrats have become more affluent and educated. But that has left the party\u2019s leaders, donors, operatives and other decision-makers more removed from the lives of low- and middle-income workers, some labor leaders say.",
      "For instance, they say Democrats refused to acknowledge the impact of post-Covid inflation, from which higher-income professionals were more insulated, and instead tried to persuade Americans to believe abstract economic metrics over their lived experiences of painful credit card swipes at the grocery store.",
      "\u201cThey failed to address inflation, saying that it wasn\u2019t a big issue or that the pain that working people feel right now isn\u2019t real,\u201d Jimmy Williams, the president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said on X. \u201cThe Democratic Party has continued to fail to prioritize a strong, working class message that addresses issues that really matter to workers.\u201d",
      "Trade unions like the Laborers and Painters tend to be whiter, more male and more conservative than service-sector unions. And the labor movement includes a vast range of opinions. But there is widespread frustration that Trump outflanked Democrats to position himself as a champion of working people, as well as dissatisfaction with Democrats not limited to white or male union members.",
      "\u201cThe narrative that he was able to craft was almost right out of the labor unions\u2019 playbook in terms of focusing on the economy and jobs, bringing manufacturing jobs back, getting tough on China, making sure that working families can put more money in their pocket,\u201d said Liz Schuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the massive labor federation that includes 60 unions that together represent 12 million people.",
      "Schuler said that message, from a billionaire who has stiffed workers and fell far short on promised job creation, is bogus \u2014 \u201cHe talks a good game but never delivers\u201d \u2014 but she could not deny its power at the polls.",
      "Trump made his pitch directly to rank-and-file members, telling them to ignore union leaders \u201cwho rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues\u201d \u2014 even if he sometimes made that case to nonunionized workers.",
      "And working-class support for Democrats is hardly a new phenomenon. But some in the party say those long-term trends have reached a crisis point.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re an average working person out there, do you really think that the Democratic Party is going to the mats, taking on powerful special interests and fighting for you? I think the overwhelming answer is no,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on NBC News \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Democrats have tried to win back working-class voters with policies designed to help them, especially by supporting unions.",
      "The theory, accepted as a truism on the left, is that good policy leads to good politics and that people will reward you with their votes if you do things to make their lives better. But the results of that strategy have been disappointing.",
      "Biden went all in on unions. One of his first actions as president was an $83 billion taxpayer-funded bailout of the Teamsters pension fund. He even launched his second presidential campaign from a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh, saying: \u201cI make no apologies. I am a union man.\u201d",
      "But the Teamsters could not return the favor. After surveys of their roughly 1.3 million rank-and-file members found that 60% supported Trump while only 34% supported Harris, Teamsters leaders decided not to endorse anyone.",
      "Most unions still backed Harris, as is typical for a Democratic presidential candidate, but the Teamsters were not the only union to break from the precedent. The International Association of Fire Fighters and the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, both of which backed Biden in 2020, and the United Mine Workers of America all sat out the race entirely.",
      "That despite Biden\u2019s embracing organized labor\u2019s policy wish list, from pro-union appointments to the National Labor Relations Board to executive actions to strengthen unions, while potentially creating millions of union jobs through massive spending on infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors. Biden was even the first president to walk a strike picket line.",
      "After she took over as the party\u2019s nominee, Harris, a longtime champion of organized labor in the Senate who also walked a picket line, vowed to uphold and expand on Biden\u2019s pro-union policy.",
      "But that policy was not enough to overcome larger societal forces that have led many working-class voters to doubt Democrats\u2019 commitment to their well-being.",
      "\u201cIf there is one single lesson of the last election, and really the last four years, it\u2019s that delivering material benefits to workers will not help you electorally,\u201d said Will Stancil, a progressive policy analyst with a large social media following. \u201cWhich basically annihilates the left\u2019s entire theory of politics.\u201d"

      "A\u00a0recess\u00a0appointment\u00a0occurs when a president unilaterally bypasses the Senate\u2019s responsibility to confirm Cabinet nominees and appoints them to the job during a period when both the House and Senate are not in session for at least 10 days.",
      "Johnson said Sunday, \u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate all that at the appropriate time, and we\u2019ll make the appropriate decision. There may be a function for that. We\u2019ll have to see how it plays out.\u201d",

      "To allow the recess appointment process to take place, the House and Senate would have to both vote to adjourn for a period of at least 10 days, which would either require them to agree unanimously to do so, or would require both chambers to vote on a concurrent resolution to adjourn for a specific amount of time.",
      "Both chambers usually gavel in for pro forma sessions even during times of recess specifically to prevent the president from making recess appointments and bypassing congressional approval.",

      "While serving in Congress, he was the subject of an investigation by the House Ethics Committee into allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has repeatedly denied the allegations, but senators on both sides of the aisle have called for the committee\u2019s report to be released publicly or shared with them privately ahead of his confirmation vote.",
      "Johnson had previously advocated against the release of the report and on Sunday told CNN, \u201cWhat I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out, and why, because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member. There\u2019s a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to nonmembers of Congress.\u201d",
      "He added that senators will \u201chave a rigorous review and vetting process in the Senate, but they don\u2019t need to rely upon a report or a draft report, a rough draft report that was prepared by the Ethics Committee for its very limited purposes.\u201d",
      "Johnson also said that he has not spoken to the president-elect about the ethics report.",
      "\u201cI have literally not discussed one word about the ethics report, not once, and I\u2019ve been with him quite a bit this week,\u201d Johnson said."

      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., on Sunday defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, saying Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, is \u201cextremely intelligent when it comes to\u201d vaccines and questioning levels of autism in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sat down and had a long conversation with [Kennedy], and I actually find the guy extremely intelligent when it comes to this stuff. And some of this stuff does raise a lot of questions,\u201d Mullin said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when he was asked whether Kennedy\u2019s history of questioning the efficacy of vaccines is a deal-breaker for him.",
      "\u201cI have said that there\u2019s some positives to vaccinations. I\u2019ve also questioned the vaccines multiple times, and I think they should be questioned,\u201d Mullin told moderator Kristen Welker before he falsely linked vaccines to autism, something Kennedy has repeatedly done for years, even though there is no evidence that vaccines cause the condition.",
      "\u201cFor instance, why is America highest in autism? What is causing that? Is it our diet, or is it some of the stuff we\u2019re putting in our children\u2019s system?\u201d Mullin said, adding: \u201cWhat is causing that? And if it isn\u2019t vaccines, there\u2019s nothing wrong with actually taking a hard look and finding out is that\u2019s what\u2019s causing it. Is it something else that we\u2019re putting in our systems? We do know we\u2019re not as healthy as we should be right now.\u201d",
      "While it is true that autism spectrum disorder has been diagnosed at increasing levels \u201cmost years since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking ASD in 2000,\u201d according to the CDC, the agency notes that \u201cthe studies continue to show that vaccines are\u00a0not\u00a0associated with ASD.\u201d",
      "The agency points to two studies, one from the National Academy of Medicine and one from the CDC, that found that vaccines do not cause autism. The first reviewed the safety of eight individual vaccines for children and adults. The second study reviewed antigens given to children during the first two years of life. Both studies found that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of baselessly questioning the efficacy of vaccines and has also promoted conspiracy theories about fluoride, heavy metals in food and pesticides.",
      "Mullin also spoke Sunday about some of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet nominees, like former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who was nominated to be the next attorney general, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth, who was selected to be the next defense secretary.",
      "Mullin agreed that he and Gaetz, who once served together in the House, \u201chave had our differences,\u201d but he added: \u201cMoving forward, I do, I do respect President Trump\u2019s right to appoint these individuals. But underneath Article II, Section 2 [of the Constitution], Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I\u2019m going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual.\u201d",
      "Gaetz has long faced scrutiny from his colleagues and outsiders about\u00a0a yearslong federal investigation launched by the Justice Department into allegations that he may have been involved in human trafficking or had sex with a minor.",
      "Gaetz has denied the allegations, and the investigation ended with the Justice Department opting not to charge him.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched its own investigation into Gaetz, but with his resignation from the House last week, it is unclear whether the report will ever be publicly released.",
      "Several senators, on both sides of the aisle,\u00a0have asked to see the report\u00a0as they consider how to vote on the nomination, and others still are skeptical that Gaetz will ever get enough votes to be confirmed.",
      "Last week, an attorney for the 17-year-old who said she had sex with Gaetz while she was a minor called on the committee to release the report,\u00a0writing on X\u00a0that \u201cshe was a high school student and there were witnesses.\u201d",
      "Also last week, a lawyer for another woman interviewed by the committee\u00a0said his client\u00a0\u201ctestified to the House Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Rep. Gaetz having sex with a minor at a house party in Orlando in 2017.\u201d",
      "Mullin told Welker that the findings in the report \u201cshould be definitely part of our decision-making.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe the, I believe the Senate should have access to that. Now, should it be released to the public or not? That, that\u2019s, I guess that will be part of the negotiations, but that should be definitely part of our decision-making,\u201d he said.",
      "He also defended Hegseth, who faces a\u00a0newly resurfaced allegation\u00a0of sexual assault. Hegseth has denied the allegation and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations but confirmed payments made to the accuser, saying in a statement: \"This is a situation where a consensual encounter occurred and, unfortunately, the woman had to come up with a lie to explain why the woman had not come back to her husband\u2019s room that night. It wasn\u2019t reported until days later until there was pressure from her husband. It was fully investigated by police and video surveillance as well as multiple eyewitness statements show that she was the aggressor.",
      "\"Mr. Hegseth is completely innocent. It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later after she lost her job that she began trying to squeeze Mr. Hegseth for money,\" Parlatore added. \u201cIn 2023, Hegseth paid the complainant as part of a civil confidential settlement agreement and maintains his innocence.\"",
      "Mullin told Welker: \u201cI think he\u2019s a good pick. But once again, as allegations come out, we\u2019ll figure out if, as, as the Senate moves forward with the advise and consent to the president of the United States and doing our constitutional duties, we\u2019ll figure out if he can get confirmed or not, and, and I do think that Pete\u2019s a good pick for this position.\u201d",
      "Mullin also indicated that he would support Trump\u2019s pursuing confirmation of some of his picks via the recess appointment process, which Trump said on Truth Social he would ask of the Senate majority leader before Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., as their new majority leader last week.",
      "A recess appointment process would allow the president to place the House and the Senate into recess so he could appoint his nominees without having to go through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "It\u2019s something that the Senate strives to avoid, and it\u2019s why the chamber gavels into pro forma sessions even while it\u2019s in recess.",
      "Mullin acknowledged that it is a \u201cvery difficult\u201d process and recalled that President Barack Obama tried to use the recess appointment process and was rebuked by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be the absolute last resort,\u201d Mullin told Welker. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what we have to do to get the confirmation through, then absolutely, let\u2019s do it. But I would say that would be last option.\u201d"

      "In a Week 11 slate defined by huge NFL matchups, one of the best was saved for last.",
      "Under the \"Sunday Night Football\" spotlight, a desperate Cincinnati team urgent to maintain its slim playoff hopes trailed 27-6 to the Chargers and appeared listless in the early minutes of the third quarter before it scored 21 straight points on three consecutive drives in the second half to force a tie and turn a yawner into a thriller.",
      "It had opportunities to break it late in the fourth quarter. But Bengals kicker Evan McPherson missed two field goals wide left \u2014 one by just inches, the second by feet \u2014 to give the Chargers the opportunity to close out what once seemed like an assured victory.",
      "With 45 seconds left in the fourth quarter, and 84 yards from the end zone, Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert began what would be the game-winning drive. After Herbert found receiver Ladd McConkey for long completions, he handed off to running back J.K. Dobbins, who ran in the go-ahead 29-yard touchdown with 18 seconds to play. They were the first points scored by the Chargers (7-3) after their previous five drives ended either in punts or a fumble.",
      "Cincinnati\u2019s 21-point rally would have matched the franchise record for largest comeback. Instead, Chargers defensive back Alohi Gilman knocked down Joe Burrow\u2019s Hail Mary attempt short of the goal line as time expired. The Bengals (4-7) settle for yet another close loss and are now 1-6\u00a0in games decided by a touchdown or less. Herbert completed 17 of his 36 passes, setting a season low for completion percentage, for 297 yards with two touchdowns, and added 65 yards on the ground, but he also fumbled.",
      "Dobbins added 56 yards, and the Chargers rushed for 155 overall, their most since Week 2.",
      "McConkey grabbed six passes for 123 yards, with 55 coming on the game\u2019s final drive.",
      "Since they started 0-3, the Bengals had won four of their last seven entering Sunday, with one of those losses in overtime and another by just one point. Not being able to close out close games was a trend: In one-score games, they were 1-5. Make that 1-6 now, despite Burrow\u2019s second-half theatrics.

      "With his team needing a two-point conversion to tie and only one minute remaining in Baltimore\u2019s Week 11 matchup in Pittsburgh, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson ran to his left Sunday, looking for either a receiver or a running lane.",
      "Neither immediately opened, yet the play was anything but over; Jackson, one of the league\u2019s most elusive playmakers, has slipped a defense\u2019s apparent straitjacket many times before on the way to becoming the NFL\u2019s two-time Most Valuable Player.",
      "But Sunday, all Jackson could do before he ran out of room toward the sideline was throw a desperate heave to no one in particular, which hit the ground. The play was a designed quarterback run, Jackson told reporters.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a one-play exception. By containing Jackson and his teammates all game, Pittsburgh pulled off in its 18-16 win what might be the hardest act in football \u2014 shutting down a Ravens offense so efficient in both the pass and the run that advanced\u00a0statistics\u00a0ranked as a statistical outlier.",

His passer rating also was a season low. Pressured into four sacks, the most Baltimore has allowed since last season\u2019s playoff loss to Kansas City, Jackson ran for only 46 yards.",
      "The Steelers also bottled up Derrick Henry, the NFL\u2019s leading rusher, who entered averaging 6.1 yards per rush and 112 yards per game. Henry finished with 65 yards and a touchdown on only 13 carries. The Ravens, who lead the NFL in expected points added on third downs, converted only four of their 11 third downs against Pittsburgh.",

      "Ravens coach John Harbaugh lamented two missed field goals by Justin Tucker that cost six points \u2014 Tucker, one of the most accurate kickers in history, is just 16-22 this season \u2014 and his team\u2019s 12 penalties, including an illegal man downfield call that negated a large gain on the final drive. Jackson and a Ravens defense that didn\u2019t allow a single touchdown almost made the self-inflicted mistakes moot. Instead, he ran out of room on the two-point conversion, Pittsburgh ran out the clock, and the Steelers solved one of the NFL\u2019s hardest problems."

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 20:24:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have accused Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of breaking jail rules in an attempt to manipulate witness testimony and taint the potential jury pool in his case, according to a court document filed Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors have accused Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of breaking jail rules in an attempt to manipulate witness testimony and taint the potential jury pool in his case, according to a court document filed Friday.",
      "Combs, 55, is currently in custody in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center as he faces charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The music mogul entered a not guilty plea and has been denied bail in the case.",
      "His legal team is fighting the decision to keep Combs in federal custody and has requested a new bail hearing. Prosecutors filed an opposition to the motion in the Southern District of New York, accusing Combs of engaging in obstruction even while he sits behind bars.",
      "Combs has allegedly \u201ccontinued to try to evade law enforcement monitoring, corruptly influence witness testimony, and further attack the integrity of these proceedings,\u201d the filing said.",
      "According to prosecutors, Combs has ordered payments to fellow inmates to use their telephone accounts and has used three-way calling to contact people who are not on his approved contacts list against federal prison regulations.",
      "A review of recorded calls also found that Combs instructed his family to contact potential victims and witnesses in his case, as well as promote narratives on social media to influence a potential jury pool in his upcoming May trial, the motion said.",
      "\u201cAt the defendant\u2019s carefully curated direction, the defendant\u2019s children posted a video to their respective social media accounts showing the defendant\u2019s children gathered to celebrate the defendant\u2019s birthday,\u201d the filing said.",
      "NBC News previously reported, along with numerous other outlets, that Combs\u2019 children posted a video of themselves singing happy birthday to their father while on the phone.",
      "Combs then monitored the analytics of the post\u2019s engagement \u201cand explicitly discussed with his family how to ensure that the video had his desired effect on potential jury members,\u201d the filing said.",
      "Some details in the prosecution\u2019s filings were redacted, including excerpts of phone calls apparently made by Diddy and his \u201cadult son\u201d that the prosecution say showed \u201cthe clear inference that the defendant\u2019s goal is to blackmail victims and witnesses either into silence or providing testimony helpful to his defense.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors wrote that there is \u201cno condition\u201d that could be set to assure Combs is not a flight risk or a threat to the safety of others.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s emphasis on 24/7 private security is also problematic,\u201d the motion said. \u201cThe defendant has demonstrated an uncanny ability to get others to do his bidding \u2014 employees, family members, and MDC inmates alike.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the prosecution\u2019s filing to deny their client a new bail hearing.",
      "Scrutiny around Combs first began last year when his former romantic partner Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, filed a lawsuit that alleged Combs raped and beat her in fits of \u201cuncontrollable rage\u201d and exerted a \u201ctight hold over her life.\u201d",
      "The suit also alleged that he forced her to engage in sexual acts he called \u201cfreak offs\u201d with other men while he watched. The other men were often sex workers whom he\u2019d pay to travel with them, the suit said.",
      "Ventura settled with Combs a day after the lawsuit became public, and Combs denied all of the allegations in it. And although Combs issued a blanket denial of the allegations, surveillance video surfaced that showed Combs beating Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016, similar to an incident that Cassie had described in her lawsuit.",
      "Combs posted on Instagram a since-removed video apology for the assault, saying he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his actions and describing it as one of the \u201cdarkest times\u201d of his life.",
      "But since Ventura went public with her accusations against Combs, the music producer and entrepreneur has been hit with a wave of civil lawsuits accusing him of sexually abusing dozens of others. Combs has denied all of the allegations against him.",
      "Combs was indicted in September, months after his properties were searched by Homeland Security Investigations agents in California, New York and Florida. The indictment alleged that Combs and his associates often lured women into his orbit \u201cunder the pretense of a romantic relationship.\u201d",
      "Once the women were in his world, Combs then used force, threats and coercion, including drugs to keep them \u201cobedient and compliant\u201d to push their participation in freak offs, the indictment said."

Grimmway Farms has shared pictures of all the labels in question for customer awareness.",
      "The whole carrots that were recalled were sold in stores from Aug. 14 through Oct. 23, while the baby carrots have best-if-used-by-dates ranging from Sept. 11 to Nov. 12, 2024, Grimmway Farms said.",
      "While they are no longer being sold in stores, Grimmway Farms warned customers who may still have them in their fridges to throw them away.",

His was one of multiple 911 calls reporting a shooting in the city\u2019s Sunset Park neighborhood, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said last week.",
      "Durham reported that he was inside the house with his 15-year-old daughter and he was going to lock himself in a bathroom, Koren told reporters Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe loss of life in any type of incident like this is always tragic, and it\u2019s something we take very seriously,\u201d Koren said.",

      "Two people can be seen struggling in a doorway, one in a red sweatshirt with a hood over their head, and the other a man apparently in his underwear with his arms around the person in the sweatshirt.",
      "The man without clothing was later identified as Durham and the person in the sweatshirt as Alejandra Boudreaux, a suspect in the case.",
      "\u201cHey, drop the knife,\u201d the officer said. \u201cDrop the knife.\u201d",
      "Approximately two seconds after issuing the command, the officer fired the gun and Durham appeared to be hit, according to the video. Both Durham and Boudreaux fell to the ground, and the officer advanced forward and fired his gun five more times, according to the video.",
      "The knife was circled in video stills shown by Koren that capture Durham and Boudreaux in the doorway and again on the ground.",
      "The investigation into the shooting is still in the early stages, Koren noted, but there were roughly three seconds from the first to last shot.",

      "She appears to have had some relationship with Durham, Koren said, but police provided no clarity as to what that relationship might be. Police believe the incident was targeted and not a random act of violence.",
      "A criminal complaint filed in her case was obtained by NBC affiliate KSNV. The complaint alleges that Boudreaux broke into the home with a weapon with the intention of provoking a police response that is sometimes referred to as \u201csuicide by cop,\u201d the station reported.",
      "NBC News was unable to obtain a copy of the complaint from the court on Sunday.",
      "The officer\u2019s use of force is being reviewed using the standard set by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Graham v. Connor, Koren told reporters. The decision stemmed from a 1984 police brutality case and established an \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard for use of force.",
      "A review of the shooting will take into account what the officer\u2019s \u201cthreat perception\u201d was in the moment, Koren said.",
      "\u201cOur officers, unfortunately, have a very challenging job that during these types of incidents, they don\u2019t have the ability to stop time and stop a video and get a still and then spend minutes, let alone hours or days or months, analyzing that information to make their decision,\u201d Koren said.",
      "Durham\u2019s 15-year-old daughter Isabella told KSNV that she was angry at the police department, which has made it so that she will \u201clive fatherless for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe violence that occurred here was under someone who was extremely, extremely angry and extremely violent,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cAnd I am disgusted in how the Metropolitan Police told my father, after killing him, to stay down.\u201d",

    "title": "Why Kennedy Ryan calls her romance books 'Trojan horses'",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 15:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Kennedy Ryan just rereleased her 2021 book \"Reel\" with a new cover and epilogue. She tells TODAY.com about her publishing journey and the importance of the romance genre.",
    "story": [
      "Does Kennedy Ryan like making her readers cry?",
      "Technically, yes, she says.",
      "The bestselling author, who\u2019s celebrating the rerelease of her novel \u201cReel,\u201d loves writing emotionally charged journeys.",
      "\u201cI like creating stories where people are going to feel things deeply. Writing is not just vocational. I see it as a calling,\u201d Ryan tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see my purpose for being here on Earth to write stories that crater in people\u2019s hearts. And when something has that kind of emotional impact, it lasts.\u201d",
      "\u201cReel,\u201d which was self-published by Ryan in 2021, is the first book in her \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series. It follows Broadway actor Neevah Saint and director Canon Holt as they film a biopic of fictional Harlem Renaissance entertainer Dessi Blue. During production, the two begin to fall in love and must navigate the adversities that arise when their professional and personal relationships intertwine.",
      "The book is a fan-favorite in the romance space, and in 2022, Ryan and her narrators became the first Black recipients of the romance category Audie, a prestigious award in audio publishing.",
      "Now, the book is being republished (with a brand new cover and epilogue!) by the Hachette Book Group\u2019s Forever imprint \u2014 part of Ryan\u2019s efforts to take her stories centering Black and brown women \u201cas far as they possibly could,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "'Reel' is a love letter to the Harlem Renaissance \u2014 and Black creatives",
      "Ryan remembers the exact moment she was inspired to write most of her books. But for \u201cReel,\u201d it was just there, she says.",
      "\u201c\u2018Reel\u2019 is the only book I can\u2019t remember how I decided to write it. And I think that\u2019s part of why it was so special,\" she says.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance, a period from the 1910s to mid-1930s that saw the meteoric rise of Black artistry, inspired much of \"Reel\" and the character of Dessi Blue.",
      "\u201cMy favorite people to write about are creatives, so this series is like a playground for me,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "The 1999 biopic \u201cIntroducing Dorothy Dandridge,\u201d starring Halle Berry, was the catalyst for Dessi Blue\u2019s character. Dandridge, who was an actor and singer, was the first African American woman to be nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards for her role in 1954\u2019s \u201cCarmen Jones.\u201d (Berry would go on to win the award for her role in 2001\u2019s \"Monster\u2019s Ball\" and remains the only Black woman to have done so.)",
      "Ryan notes that before that film, many people weren't familiar with Dandridge, inspiring her to explore the unsung accomplishments of Black creatives through Dessi's biopic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I started contextualizing \u2018Reel\u2019 as a love letter to Black creatives who, not just during the Harlem Renaissance, but throughout history, have done so much and contributed so much and not been acknowledged,\" Ryan says. \"Black music, I would hazard to say, is the most influential in culture. We wouldn\u2019t have most of the music that we have in this country without Black creatives, so I wanted to lean into that excellence.\u201d",
      "Dessi Blue is inspired by an amalgamation of artists from the Harlem Renaissance, such as Billie Holiday, Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. And though her character is fictional, Ryan says she does receive messages from fans saying they\u2019ve tried to look up Dessi Blue.",
      "\u201c(Dessi's story) is just their real experiences fictionalized,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cEven the fact that she\u2019s bisexual. That was something that some of those women navigated during that time, and I wanted that representation as a part of her story as well.\u201d",
      "Kennedy Ryan's road to traditional publication",
      "\u201cReel\u201d is just one of Ryan\u2019s many books to be picked up for distribution from a traditional publisher.",
      "\u201cYou know, a lot of people don\u2019t realize that I had a four-book series that I published traditionally. That was my debut series,\" she says.",
      "But when self-publishing was starting to flourish, Ryan, who describes herself as a go-getter, decided to try her hand at it because she wanted creative control of her work.",
      "\u201cI wanted the autonomy to build my own brand based on my values, aesthetically and just what I wanted it to be,\" she says.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a self-published author, you do (almost) everything,\" she adds. \"You are responsible for everything. It\u2019s a business and that really tapped into something that I love.\u201d",
      "Traditional publishers were knocking on Ryan\u2019s door for years before she decided to return, she says. She knew she wanted her stories that center around Black and brown women to reach a wide audience and saw traditional publishing as a path to accomplishing that goal.",
      "\u201cI knew that the brand that I was building was centering Black and brown women very explicitly. I wanted to see them on shelves at Target. I wanted to see them at Barnes & Noble. I wanted to see them at indie bookstores. I wanted to see them on billboards,\" she says. \"These Black women with these big afros, just unapologetically gorgeous, because that\u2019s something that defies what culture tells us about ourselves. I wanted those stories to go as far as they possibly could.\"",
      "Kennedy Ryan always wants to get it right",
      "Like her character Canon in \"Reel,\" Ryan is an obsessive creative and tends to get lost in studying. She says that about 60% of her creative process is just made up of research, and when she\u2019s writing one book, she's usually reading five or six more around the same time. To make \u201cReel\u201d feel as authentic as possible, Ryan went on a deep dive on all things movie-making.",
      "\u201cI blocked off maybe a month to five weeks where I did nothing but watch MasterClasses,\" she says, referring to the online learning streaming platform. \"I just subscribed, and I watched all the greats who have MasterClasses: directors, cinematographers, writers, actors. I just consumed that world.\u201d",
      "Ryan's books often contain elements that do not come from her lived experiences. So she makes it a point to conduct thorough interviews and deep conversations with individuals who have had those experiences, she says. In addition, she says she involves sensitivity readers throughout the writing process.",
      "It\u2019s part of her personal \u201cHippocratic Oath\u201d of writing: \u201cIf you\u2019re writing a great book, but you\u2019re harming a community that\u2019s vulnerable, that\u2019s marginalized, that\u2019s not your lived experience in the process \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s my philosophy,\" she says.",
      "In \"Reel,\" Ryan's character Neevah lives with lupus, an autoimmune disease that involves the body\u2019s immune system attacking healthy tissue and organs. Ryan says she conducted multiple interviews with people who have lupus to develop a complete understanding of what it\u2019s like to live with the chronic disease.",
      "She also wanted to ensure women like Neevah felt seen.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are living with chronic illness, specifically lupus, to feel beautiful, to feel loved, to feel like they weren\u2019t too much,\" she says.",
      "This is particularly highlighted in what Ryan calls \u201cthe hottest scene in the book\u201d \u2014 the bathtub scene.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are navigating that to know you\u2019re still beautiful, you\u2019re still sexy... there\u2019s still someone who is completely drawn to you no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Having hard and honest conversations \u2013 via romance",
      "It\u2019s no secret that the romance genre has been historically looked down upon. Ryan believes animosity toward the romance genre is rooted in patriarchy and misogyny.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rooted in the resistance of anything that centers women\u2019s pleasure, that centers our agency, that esteems our wishes, anything that is counter cultural. There is a broader cultural resistance to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she says.",
      "Ryan also believes that people underestimate what romance is capable of. She describes her books as \u201cTrojan horses\u201d to \u201csmuggle in discourse\u201d and start difficult conversations readers may not usually have.",
      "\u201cThe reason I say that (romance) is the safest place to have hard discussions is because you know you\u2019re going to get a happily ever after. We might unpack some really hard things, but it\u2019s going to be OK in the end,\u201d she says.",
      "She says she strives for her books to be both \"trauma-informed\" and \"trauma-responsive.\"",
      "\u201cAnd what that means is there\u2019s a path that\u2019s laid for healing,\" she says. \"When you approach writing difficult circumstances that way, it\u2019s a safer space to have those discussions, and it can be really healing for readers, especially who have experienced some of those things.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next for the Hollywood Renaissance series?",
      "Just a few months after the rerelease of \"Reel,\" Ryan will publish the third and final book in her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough,\" out May 2025. That series kicked off with \"Before I Let Go\" in 2022.",
      "After wrapping \"Skyland,\" Ryan says she will be focusing on the next installment in the \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series, \u201cScore.\u201d \u201cScore\u201d will be a second-chance romance that focuses on the film\u2019s music supervisor and screenwriter, Monk and Verity.",
      "\u201cIt is a book that I have wanted to write for about three years, you know? When I wrote \u2018Reel\u2019 originally, I was going to go right into writing \u2018Score,\u2019 but then I got a book deal to write the \u2018Skyland\u2019 series. So I\u2019ve been in 'Skyland' for three years, and I\u2019m really just itching to write Monk and Verity\u2019s story,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "\u201cThey have a very complex history, and I look forward to unpacking how complex and angsty it is,\" she adds.",
      "As for any adaptations on the horizon? While \"Before I Let Go\" is currently being adapted for television, she\u2019s also hoping to find a production partner who shares her vision and wants to bring \u201cReel\u201d to the big screen.",
      "\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Which of your books do you most want to see on screen?\u2019 I always say \u2018Reel.' It\u2019s the book that so many readers ask me for on screen,\" Ryan says. \"So I\u2019m working on it. Fingers crossed.\u201d"

      "Debbi Morgan has a message for \"Tyler Perry's Beauty in Black\" fans who are still reeling after that epic finale: Buckle up.",
      "\"If you think part one was explosive, just wait until part two,\" the actor tells TODAY.com over Zoom.",
      "Morgan stars as Olivia, matriarch of the wealthy Bellaire family, in Tyler Perry's new series, which recently premiered on Netflix. Part One of Season One includes eight action-packed episodes that culminate in a jaw-dropping finale.",
      "\"Usually with a lot of shows, you\u2019ll have a big beginning and then you have to get all the way to the finale to get the cliffhanger. This series is a cliffhanger after each and every episode,\" Morgan explains.",
      "\"Beauty in Black\" follows the Bellaire family as they navigate family rifts, infidelity and a lawsuit against their hair care company. Along the way, several members of the family find themselves mixed up with a corrupt strip club that has trapped its employees in an endless cycle of illegal sex work.",
      "The series of shocking events that take place in the Part One finale begin at the end of Episode Seven when Olivia's son Charles (Steven G. Norfleet) is shot at by assailants as he drives down the family's private road. His car subsequently explodes and viewers are left to wonder if he survived.",
      "After filming the series, Morgan admits that she \"forgot\" about the explosion and was surprised once again while watching it.",
      "Morgan's character may have a complicated relationship with her sons, but the actor says Charles' accident will send her into true mama bear mode.",
      "\u201cOlivia is a proud churchgoing woman on Sundays and maybe a few days during the week. But if you come after her or harm either one of her sons or do anything to mess with her, listen, you better shut the front door and close all the shades. I\u2019ll leave it at that,\" she says.",
      "So what else happened in the Season One, Part One cliffhanger of \"Tyler Perry's Beauty in Black\"? Read on to learn all the juicy details.",
      "What happens at the end of 'Beauty in Black' Part One?",
      "In the Part One finale, several shocking moments occur. Here's a look back at all the drama.",
      "Throughout the first half of the season, Olivia\u2019s ex-husband Horace (Ricco Ross) has been frequenting a local strip club. Though he requests private time with a female exotic dancer named Kimmie (Taylor Polidore Williams), he really has his sights set on a male dancer named Angel (Xavier Smalls).",
      "As he gets to know Kimmie and learns that her friend Rain (Amber Reign Smith) is in the hospital, he agrees to go visit her since Kimmie's pimp forbids her from seeing her. Meanwhile, Kimmie arranges for Angel to dance privately for Horace.",
      "When Kimmie goes to Horace's house one day, she realizes he's rich and suspects that he's involved in the strip club operations since he's pictured with her pimp who manages the club.",
      "Kimmie later finds out from patients at the hospital that Rain has died and she suspects that Horace never visited her.",
      "Frustrated by the news, Kimmie agrees to Angel's idea to rob Horace so they can both escape their torturous lives at the strip club. However, their plans are short-lived after a group of masked men enter Horace's house while he's entertaining Angel and Kimmie.",
      "Horace shoots the invaders before they can rob his safe and demands answers from Angel and Kimmie, since he thinks they're involved. They explain that they work for a pimp named Jules (Charles Malik Whitfield) who has forced them into sex work to repay their debts since he got them out of past legal trouble.",
      "Horace then lets them go and calls Jules, who also happens to be his security guard. He asks him about a judge he once knew, presumably the one who helped Jules get his dancers pardoned from legal charges.",
      "When Kimmie returns to her motel room, she encounters Body (Tamera Kissen), a stripper and low-level boss who works at the strip club with her.",
      "Body, who is convinced that Kimmie is trying to take her place, reveals that she's kidnapped Kimmie's teenage sister and will be making her work for her. As she sees her sister being driven away, Kimmie starts fighting Body and then runs over to her car, where she jumps in and drives it into her nemesis.",
      "Early on in the season, Body encourages Rain to get a Brazilian butt lift from a shady lady who performed Body's procedure. The surgery goes horribly wrong and Rain ends up in the hospital. When Kimmie goes to visit her one day, other patients who were in the same hall as Rain say that she died.",
      "As Kimmie prepares to rob Horace, she gets a call from Rain and is shocked to hear that her friend is still alive. Rain is in a top-notch hospital (all thanks to Horace) and Angel and Kimmie eventually go visit her there.",
      "Mallory has been sneaking around with her driver Calvin (Shannon Wallace) and her husband Roy (Julian Horton) begins to suspect something when they're in the car together and he notices that his wife isn't wearing underwear.",
      "On the ride home, they come across an accident and Mallory realizes that it's Charles' car that's on fire. She then calls her father-in-law to come to the scene.",
      "When does 'Beauty in Black' Part 2 air ?",
      "With so many unanswered questions looming, Morgan understands why viewers are so eager to see Part Two of Season One, which will premiere in the spring and feature another eight episodes.",
      "\u201cTyler knows his audience and he has his pulse on what his loyal and faithful fans want to watch. And it\u2019s always these over the top, thrilling, sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen next (moments),\" she says.",
      "What happens in Part 2 of 'Beauty in Black'?",
      "Though it's still uncertain what will happen in the Season One, Part Two of \"Tyler Perry's Beauty in Black,\" Morgan teases that as the season progresses, viewers will get to see more of Olivia.",
      "\"This role is so delicious, so juicy,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"And for an actor, it\u2019s always so much more fun to play a bad, flawed character. But also in playing a character like this, I wanted to make sure that you saw there was a soft spot somewhere, some vulnerability.\"",
      "\"And you see that with her love for Charles in protecting him,\" she adds.",
      "After the finale aired, viewers began to share memes of the characters on social media. Several X users applauded Morgan's performance, including one who wrote, \"OLIVIAAAAA! I just love seeing Debbi Morgan on my screen & I better see more of her in season 2.\"",
      "Another shared the following reaction alongside a GIF of her character: \"Debbi Morgan has been pretty all her life. She IS #BeautyInBlack.\"",
      "Morgan is entertained by fans' reaction to the series and that some have went as far to share memes of her on social media.",
      "\u201cI think anything that keeps the audience interested and entertained that they want to be making all of these memes (is wonderful). It just (shows) how addicted they are to the show, which is great. That's exactly what we all want,\" she says.",
      "As is often the case, the show has received some mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 51% and Decider called the show \"about a subtle as a slap in the face.\"",
      "Essence, meanwhile, bemoaned the series' sexual content, saying it \"often feels unneeded,\" and said \"much of the series can feel hollow.\"",
      "Morgan says she doesn't let the critic reviews get to her.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not about the critics. It\u2019s about what the fans love, what they want to see,\" she says. \"It seems to me you shouldn\u2019t necessarily ignore (viewers' opinions) if people are loving the show (just) because it\u2019s not a show for you. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a good show.\""

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 02:27:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Who does Joan Vassos choose in the Golden Bachelorette finale? Find out if Joan Vassos and Chock Chapple are still together now.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "It was a love story for the (golden) ages! In the emotional finale of \"The Golden Bachelorette,\" Joan Vassos chose her winner on the island of Bora Bora.",
      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",
      "Joan, who lost her husband John to pancreatic cancer in 2021, was previously a contestant on \u201cThe Golden Bachelor.\u201d She departed the season voluntarily to care for her daughter, who had recently given birth.",
      "\"I feel happy about my future now that it looks a lot brighter. Chock is the reason for all of this,\" Joan said in a confessional interview.",
      "What happened in the 'Golden Bachelorette' finale?",
      "Chock emerged as a frontrunner early on, but his connection with Joan was cemented after meeting her adult children.",
      "The meeting was emotional \u2014 Joan's son Nick seemed to initially balk when Chock kissed Joan on the lips as a way of a greeting.",
      "But her kids came around. Chock promised that he was not here to \"replace\" their late father in any \"way shape or form.\"",
      "Joan and her kids also marked the difficulty of her moving on romantically. \u201cIf I loved Dad so much, would I be able to fall in love again?\u201d Joan questioned. Nick cheered her on, saying he and his sister were \"proud\" to see her \"take risks,\" and proud of the \"incredible strength\" she demonstrates.",
      "Chock, on his end, said he had a \"great time,\" calling her family \"good people.\"",
      "After the date, Chock declared his love for Joan. While Joan didn't respond, it was enough for her to decide that Chock would be her future husband. She realized was worthy of love \u2014 which came into question following her breakup with contestant Pascal Ibgui.",
      "The episode before the finale, Pascal, a salon owner from Chicago, broke up with Joan in an emotional boat cruise in Tahiti, telling her that he didn\u2019t feel a strong connection.",
      "\"It just makes me feel like I'm unlovable,\" Joan said at the time of the breakup. \"If he couldn't love me, how could anybody love me?\"",
      "And so, before Guy had the opportunity to meet Joan's family, Joan broke up with him. During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, she clarified that she was \"getting there\" with Guy, but they needed more time.",
      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",
      "Joan said she hopes she and Guy stay friends and can double date.",
      "Chock proposed on the beach",
      "Heading into the final scenes, Joan and Chock said they felt ready and excited to get engaged.",
      "Joan declared that she wants to \"spend the rest of her life\" with Chock. She had lost hope in her future \u2014 and he helped her bring it back. Chock, meanwhile, said he couldn't believe he found this \"incredible opportunity\" at this point in his life.",
      "In his proposal, Chock said he was \"so absolutely happy\" to be in her life, and have her in his. He acknowledged their late partners and said he would \"honor\" John by \"loving her every day.\"",
      "Joan, similarly, acknowledged the difficulty of having Chock step away from filming because his mother passed away. This, she said, was the moment she knew she couldn't complete the show's journey without him.",
      "\"We are living proof that no matter what life throws at you, there is still hope, even at our age,\" Joan said, proceeding to tell Chock she loved him for the first time.",
      "And with that, Chock got down on one knee and proposed with a Neil Lane ring (naturally). She gave him the final golden rose.",
      "After the proposal, the happy couple FaceTimed with Joan's mom from the beach, who expressed her shock and delight at meeting her daughter's new partner.",
      "\"I never in a million years thought I'd feel love like this again. Ever,\" Joan said.",
      "So, are Joan Vassos and Chock still together?",
      "Host Jesse Palmer revealed Joan and Chock as the franchise\u2019s \u201cnewest \u2018Golden Bachelorette\u2019 couple,\u201d indicating they are still together.",
      "The couple confirmed it in an interview.",
      "\"This feels so good. I'm looking at our family and friends who we've never gotten to be with together, so it's so nice to finally be able to share our love and our story and our future with them,\" Joan said to her loved ones, who were sitting in the audience.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and I want the world to know it,\u201d Chock said. He then spoke up for his fianc\u00e9e for her behavior on the show. \u201cI want to tell the world, the fans, how classy Joan is and the respect she gave all the other guys,\u201d he added.",
      "Since the engagement, Joan and Chock were able to spend quality time together out of the public eye.",
      "\"We cooked, we played crosswords, I mean we did everything,\" Chock said.",
      "Jesse, in a surprise at the end of the finale, said the show was sending both of their families on a trip to Disney world, earning lots of claps from Joan's grandson."

    "title": "Nearly 20 years after Pat Morita\u2019s death, \u2018Cobra Kai\u2019 is still introducing twists in Mr. Miyagi\u2019s story",
    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Cobra Kai\" Season 6, Part 2, premiering on Netflix on Nov. 15, provides new developments in the backstory for Mr. Miyagi, the late Pat Morita's \"Karate Kid\" character.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers below for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d Season 6, Part 2.",
      "After three movies and several TV seasons, Ralph Macchio's Daniel LaRusso is still learning more about his mentor and sensei, Mr. Miyagi.",
      "Pat Morita originated the role in the 1984 film that started it all, \"The Karate Kid.\" He returned for \"The Karate Kid Part II,\" \"The Karate Kid Part III\" and the Hilary Swank-led \"The Next Karate Kid.\"",
      "Daniel's story picked up back up in 2018 with the premiere of \"Cobra Kai.\" While Morita died in November 2005, his character has appeared in the Netflix spinoff show through archival footage.",
      "Fans of the show know that Mr. Miyagi has become an almost omnipresent figure, guiding Daniel even in death as Daniel tries to take up the mantle of sensei for the next generation of Los Angeles karate prodigies. He names his dojo Miyago-Do and tries to pass on the teachings of his late mentor, often running up against rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).",
      "But Season 6 complicates what Daniel knew about Mr. Miyagi's past. For a quick refresher, in the original \"Karate Kid\" film, Mr. Miyagi tells a young Daniel that he served in World War II and his wife died in childbirth at a U.S. internment camp. \"The Karate Kid Part II\" dove deeper into his past in Okinawa, revealing that Miyagi left Japan for Hawaii after a falling out with his best friend Sato, the uncle of Chozen (Yuji Okumoto).",
      "Flash forward to Season 6 of \"Cobra Kai.\" In Part 1 \u2014 which comprises the first five episodes of the season \u2014 Daniel unearths a box that belonged to Mr. Miyagi. Inside, he finds boxing gloves, a passport, a piece of fabric and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Police search for assailant,\" dated to 1947. The passport features a photo of Mr. Miyagi next to the name \"Keisuke Miyagi,\" rather than Nariyoshi, the first name Daniel knew him to have. The clipping also reveals that Keisuke Miyagi was accused of violent robbery and assault.",
      "The boxing gloves and passport address lead Daniel to a gym. A man, purporting to be the grandson of the gym's original owner, says Mr. Miyagi was a silent partner in the gym. The man also reveals that Mr. Miyagi at one point fled the United States.",
      "In the last scene of Episode 5, Daniel realizes the significance of the headband. After Miyagi-Do qualifies for an international karate tournament in Barcelona, the Sekai Taikai, Daniel realizes the fabric matches the headbands awarded to team captains. The moment implies that Mr. Miyagi has a history at the Sekai Taikai, sending Daniel on a mission to learn more about his mentor's past \u2014\u00a0and all its dark twists and turns.",
      "Macchio describes the box and its revelations as something that \"unravels\" Daniel.",
      "\"He\u2019s kind of chasing the past instead of focusing on the present, let alone the future, for his students and everyone else,\" Macchio tells TODAY.com.",
      "Digging into Mr. Miyagi's past in Part 2, which consists of Episodes 6-10 and dropped on Netflix Nov. 15, will bring new obstacles. But his character can't help but investigate, Macchio says.",
      "\"When you have loss in your life, whether it\u2019s a parent or a mentor or a brother or sister, and you have something unknown, you grasp it, wanting to understand,\" Macchio says. \"It\u2019s important to go through that to get to the other side, to the resolve of what that is.",
      "\"In Part 2, it\u2019s the deepest and darkest dive for him that gets him a bit in trouble,\" Macchio adds.",
      "What is Mr. Miyagi's secret in 'Cobra Kai' Season 6?",
      "Once the Miyagi-Do crew arrives in Barcelona for the Sekai Taikai, Daniel starts asking organizers if they recognize Mr. Miyagi's headband. In Episode 6, a woman representing the company that makes the tournament's official apparel tells Daniel that Miyagi's headband was likely from the \"1950s era, maybe even 1940s,\" meaning Mr. Miyagi was likely involved in the Sekai Taikai after World War II.",
      "The headband is coated in dried blood, and one of the organizers reveals that the Sekai Taikai tournaments \"were even more brutal back then.\"",
      "Daniel's search for more info about Miyagi's background with the tournament hits a snag in Episode 7. After following a lead to speak with a Mr. Serrano, a former champion old enough to potentially have more information, Daniel falls into a trap and ends up caged. He eventually escapes and fights his way out in direct combat with a man with a snake \u2014 specifically the Cobra Kai symbol \u2014 tattooed on his arm.",
      "Shenanigans ensue, including the return of the No. 3 most villainest \"Karate Kid\" universe villain according to TODAY.com, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), who was responsible for kidnapping Daniel. At the end of Episode 9, Silver, now associated with the defending champions, the Iron Dragons dojo, gives Daniel a manila envelope.",
      "\"A gift, from me to you,\" Silver says.",
      "Inside is a piece of paper, purportedly the Sekai Taikai record from the year Mr. Miyagi competed. The spreadsheet shows that Miyagi faced someone named Claramunt. In the final score column, it simply says, \"Death.\"",
      "\"He killed his opponent,\" Daniel says in shock.",
      "The Part 2 finale opens with Daniel dreaming. In the sequence, he faces a young Mr. Miyagi, as someone from the crowd shouts, \"Kill him, Miyagi-san.\"",
      "The fight starts, and the young Miyagi gets off the first and second points. \"If this is a lesson, I'm not getting it,\" Daniel says.",
      "\"Lesson?\" the dream Miyagi responds in Japanese.",
      "\"There's so much you never told me,\" Daniel says next. \"I just need to understand why.\"",
      "\"That was always your problem, Daniel-san. So eager to understand, but not willing to accept,\" Miyagi says.",
      "Daniel, now lying on his back, looks up at Miyagi before the final hit. He blinks, and a face resembling Morita's looks back at him and says, \"Miyagi never tell you everything, Daniel-san, because you were never strong enough to accept truth.\"",
      "After waking up, Daniel goes back to the tournament organizers, and they authenticate the sheet of paper with the record of Mr. Miyagi's fight.",
      "\"Sadly, the rare death did occur in that era,\" the organizer says. \"It was a different time.\"",
      "Johnny suggests it might have been a \"freak accident.\"",
      "The Part 2 finale ends before Daniel can uncover more details about Mr. Miyagi's past. By Episode 10, both Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai are in the semifinals of the Sekai Taikai. Team captains from the remaining dojos \u2014\u00a0including Miyagi-Do's Robby (Tanner Buchanan) and Sam (Mary Mouser) and Cobra Kai's Tory (Peyton List) and Kwon (Brandon H. Lee) \u2014 have to fight in one-on-one matches to qualify for the championship.",
      "In the middle of Robby's match against one of the Iron Dragons, an eliminated team attacks an organizer, starting a brawl between all of the dojos. During the fight, Kreese tries to go after Silver with an eunjangdo, a small knife, before realizing he had dropped it on the mat.",
      "Kwon finds the knife and tries to use it while fighting with one of the Iron Dragons. Instead, after getting his leg swept in midair, he falls on his stomach, landing on the knife. Daniel rolls Kwon over, the blade sticking out of his chest.",
      "So death in the Sekai Taikai might not just be a thing of the past. Similarly, the death that resulted from Mr. Miyagi's fight in the Sekai Taikai might not be so straightforward.",
      "Macchio tells TODAY.com that a resolution to the Miyagi mystery will occur in \u201cthe full course of Season 6,\u201d which consists of 15 episodes in total. Part 3 of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d Season 6 is expected in 2025.",
      "Miyagi's backstory also \"opens up more into the Miyagi-verse,\" Macchio says, which is notably expanding in May 2025 with the film \"Karate Kid: Legends,\" starring Macchio and Jackie Chan.",
      "While it's unclear how everything will shake out, Macchio notes that Season 6 won't \"taint\" the Mr. Miyagi that fans know and love.",
      "\"We never want to taint who the essence of that character was,\" Macchio says. \"But we\u2019re all human, and everyone has flaws.\u201d",

      "Alex Cross, the literary world\u2019s well-known crime detective, is receiving a makeover in the latest television adaptation, \u201cCross,\u201d coming to Amazon Prime on Nov. 14. The titular star is played stoically by \u201cBlack Adam\u201d breakout Aldis Hodge.",
      "The role of Alex Cross is not new to on-screen adaptations. The first came in 1997\u2019s \u201cKiss the Girls,\u201d with Morgan Freeman playing the hardened Washington D.C. detective. The movie was a loose adaptation of the series\u2019 second book of the same name. A second installment also starring Freeman called \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d released in 2001.",
      "The last major attempt to convert Alex Cross into an on-screen fixture came in 2012 with the aptly named film, \u201cAlex Cross\u201d starring Tyler Perry in the lead role.",
      "With multiple films and a longstanding book series in the rearview, Hodge had the difficult task of making the legendary character his own in an eight episode series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Hodge explained how he approached the task with showrunner Ben Watkins.",
      "\u201cThe perspective of how we shaped this character came in conversations with Ben Watkins where we didn\u2019t even talk about the character. We just talked about what was going on in our personal lives, our lives as men.\u201d",
      "For the 38-year-old actor, one of those \"personal\" life things included his newly appointed role as a father, which he says helped him curate his take on Alex Cross, a proud dad of two.",
      "\u201cI recently stepped into fatherhood,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI was in a whirlwind of emotions because it\u2019s such a beautiful experience. And those kinds of things really shaped how they went back to write the character as we moved through so I was really stepping into something that was already familiar.\u201d",
      "Hodge is a first-time dad to his now three-year-old daughter. In an October profile of the star by Essence magazine, Hodge expanded on how his new parental role informs his life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what feeds me. It\u2019s what drives me. It\u2019s what wakes me up in the morning. It\u2019s really the thing that makes me say, \u2018Okay, life is worth living.\u2019 It\u2019s what redefines love,\u201d he said.",
      "Hodge says being a dad was one of the ways that helped him authentically portray his character on screen. The other? He says understanding what drove the detective\u2019s everyday life.",
      "\u201cI was stepping into honesty, and all I had to do was keep remembering what Alex Cross\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 was with whatever situation he stepped into,\u201d the actor tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"We didn't have to try for that. All we had to be aware of was making honest decisions and choices,\u201d he says.",
      "The Prime series also stars Isaiah Mustafa as John Sampson, a fellow detective and longtime friend of Alex Cross. The Sampson character has made several appearances in the James Patterson novels but has seldom been brought to the screen.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mustafa opened up about bringing his character's close friendship with Cross to the screen.",
      "\u201cI looked at the relationship that Sampson had with Alex, and I let that inform me as to who Sampson was and how deep his character was, how much love he had for his partner,\u201d Mustafa says. \u201cSo to me, that was the through line. To show how much heart this character had and what he was willing to do to make sure his partner, his brother, lived up to his higher power.\u201d",
      "The backdrop of Washington D.C. also serves as an important component of this new retelling of the Alex Cross story. Hodge explains that in the show, \u201cD.C. stands as its own character.\u201d",
      "The star says that the show attempts to go beyond the political significance of nation\u2019s capital by tapping into the culture of the people that make up the city\u2019s heart.",
      "\u201cSomething that was really important to Ben was that we really bring out the flavor of D.C.\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve only really seen D.C. from the political side, the White House, the monuments,\u201d Hodge explains. \u201cWe owe it to the culture to highlight them in a celebratory way.\u2019"

      "Israel\u2019s war against the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah has killed more than 3,200 people and displaced more than a million others in Lebanon according to local officials, as its military vows to end Hezbollah\u2019s ability to launch rocket and other attacks into northern Israel, which has forced around 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes near the border.",
      "But the conflict is also taking a devastating toll on Lebanon\u2019s unique and ancient heritage, with airstrikes wiping out centuries-old villages and endangering fragile, millennia-old archaeological sites, like the celebrated Roman ruins of Baalbek, designated a World Heritage site by the United Nations body UNESCO.",
      "The historic village of Mhaibib, home to an ancient shrine, and the town of Nabatiyeh, which had a centuries-old souk, have been completely destroyed, according to social media reviewed by NBC News and interviews with former residents.",
      "Lebanon, a tiny country of around 5 million people in the eastern Mediterranean, is steeped in history and boasts five other World Heritage Sites.",
      "The country has been at the crossroads of ancient civilizations, having hosted Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Persian and Roman towns, temples and monuments. Later, Christian crusaders built citadels along the coast that went on to be repurposed by Muslim Ottoman rulers.",

      "Singers have included Arab luminaries such as Fairuz and Umm Kulthum, and Western artists such as Nina Simone, Placido Domingo, Massive Attack and Deep Purple.",
      "An airstrike in early November flattened a building and destroyed buses yards away from one of the Roman structures, adding to mounting alarm among Lebanese lawmakers, who called for international intervention.",

      "Israel\u2019s military says it only targets Hezbollah, but accuses the group of embedding itself in and near civilian infrastructure, including heritage sites.",
      "But even if a site isn\u2019t directly targeted, the fighting can be devastating.",
      "Lebanese archaeologist Tania Zaven, regional director of archaeological sites in northern Mount\u00a0Lebanon, said the vibrations from airstrikes can crack and even topple delicate ancient structures, and destroy artifacts in the ground that are yet to be excavated.",
      "She said she was also worried that historical sites are increasingly becoming casualties of war, citing the Islamic State militant group\u2019s destruction of ancient structures and statues in northern Iraq and Syria between 2013 and 2019, as well as the Taliban\u2019s destruction of Afghanistan\u2019s Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001.",

      "\u201cI can only describe what I\u2019m trying to do and that\u2019s trying to do it differently and I\u2019m trying to do it for my generation,\u201d William, 42, told Sky News on Saturday as he wrapped up a weeklong tour of South Africa in the legislative capital, Cape Town.",

      "William has thought about how he might make his mark and approach things differently in both his current role as the Prince of Wales and, one day, as king, NBC\u00a0News royal commentator\u00a0Daisy McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cHe will be all too aware of how dangerous it is for the royal family to be seen to be out of touch or aloof and hence the emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence,\u201d she said.",

He barely does anything at all. He\u2019s an incredibly lazy man who manages to get a pretty small splashing of engagements to look like he is busy.\u201d",

      "The estate is the primary residence of Prince William, Princess Kate and their family.",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Monday, Thames Valley Police said it received a report of a burglary \"at a property on Crown Estate land\" at around 11.45pm on Sunday 13 October.",
      "The offenders entered a farm building and and \"made off with a black Izuzu pickup and a red quad bike\" before heading toward a nearby town, police said.",

    "story": [
      "During a landmark visit to the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, President Joe Biden highlighted his climate legacy, declaring that no one can reverse America\u2019s green transition as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s fossil-friendly policies loom large.",
      "Biden is the first sitting U.S. president to visit the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, which plays a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but is under growing threat from climate change.",
      "During an aerial tour from his Marine One helicopter, Biden saw dried-up riverbeds, eroded shores and plumes of smoke from the Amazon\u2019s worst forest fires in two decades, which have burned millions of acres this year and greatly disrupted life for its Indigenous communities.",
      "Speaking afterward at the Museum of the\u00a0Amazon\u00a0in Manaus, Brazil, Biden said the fight against climate change had been a \u201cdefining cause\u201d of his presidency. He cited the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022, which together with other legislation provides $450 billion in clean energy funding, he said, as well as creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and positioning the United States to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030.",
      "Biden also said Sunday that the U.S. had surpassed his goal of delivering $11 billion per year in climate financing to developing countries by 2024, a more than six-fold increase from when Biden took over from Trump in 2021. This makes the U.S. the largest bilateral provider of climate finance in the world, the White House said.",
      "Biden began his term by bringing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change that his predecessor, Trump, had withdrawn from. Trump, a climate change skeptic, has said he will withdraw from the agreement again as well as loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, Biden said he had left his successor and country a \u201cstrong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.\u201d",
      "While some may seek to delay the country\u2019s green transition, \u201cnobody can reverse it, nobody,\u201d Biden said, \u201cnot when so many people, regardless of party or politics, are enjoying its benefits.\u201d"

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia unleashed its largest air strike on Ukraine in almost three months on Sunday, launching 120 missiles and 90 drones that killed at least seven people and caused severe damage to the power system, officials said.",
      "Ukrainians had been bracing for weeks for a renewed Russian attack on an already hobbled energy system, fearing long winter blackouts and mounting psychological pressure almost\u00a01,000 days\u00a0after Russia launched its\u00a0full-scale invasion.",
      "The strikes, which caused numerous power cuts, came at a time when the impending U.S. presidency of\u00a0Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war without saying how, has raised the prospect of a push for negotiations.",

      "\u201cSevere damage to Ukraine\u2019s energy system, including to DTEK power stations. These attacks again highlight Ukraine\u2019s need for additional air defense systems from our allies,\u201d said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private power company.",
      "The extent of the damage was hard to assess. After repeated Russian attacks on the power grid, officials reveal little detailed information about the outcome of strikes and the state of the network.",
      "Officials confirmed damage to \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d or power cuts in regions from Volyn, Rivne, Lviv in the west to Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast.",

      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had launched a massive strike on energy facilities that supply Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex.",
      "\u201cThe enemy\u2019s target was our energy infrastructure across Ukraine,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.",
      "Ukraine nervous about Western diplomacy",
      "Kyiv\u2019s air force said it had destroyed 104 of the incoming 120 missiles and shot down 42 drones. Another 41 disappeared from radar, it said.",
      "At least seven people were killed, in the regions of Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk, authorities said.",
      "Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Popsoi said Russian missiles and drones had violated Moldovan airspace during the attack. NATO member Poland, which also borders Ukraine, said it had scrambled its air force as a precaution.",
      "Russia last launched a major barrage at Kyiv on Aug. 26, when officials said it had fired more than 200 drones and missiles at targets across Ukraine.",
      "Its latest onslaught piles more pressure on Ukraine as Moscow\u2019s troops notch up their fastest battlefield gains in the east since 2022 in their effort to seize the entire industrial Donbas region.",
      "Ukrainian troops are meanwhile trying to hold an area of land that they seized in Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August, something Kyiv has said could one day be a bargaining chip.",
      "Sybiha said the strike appeared to be Moscow\u2019s \u201ctrue response\u201d to leaders contacting President Vladimir Putin, an apparent swipe at\u00a0German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called the Russian leader on Friday for the first time in two years.",
      "Though Scholz urged Putin to pull out his troops, which occupy a fifth of Ukraine, Kyiv bridled at a call that it said reduced Putin\u2019s isolation.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed Sybiha: \u201cThe attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine. The next weeks will be decisive, not only for the war itself, but also for our future.\u201d"

      "Bela Karolyi helped build USA Gymnastics into an Olympics and international competition powerhouse starting in the 1980s and extending through the 2010s, when his wife had taken over many of his leadership duties.",
      "After success with Nadia Com\u0103neci in Romania, the couple helped to launch the athletic careers of U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame inductees Dominique Dawes, Phoebe Mills, Betty Okino, Kerri Strug, Mary Lou Retton and Kim Zmeskal.",
      "They found early fame in Retton, the first American woman to win an Olympic individual all-around gold, which she accomplished at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.",
      "Retton was a fan of Com\u0103neci\u2019s, and found herself embedded in the program of the Karolyis in Houston in the early 1980s. She has said she didn't expect much from the experience she otherwise cherished.",
      "In an interview with USA Gymnastics in 2016, Retton described her first American Cup competition under the Karolyis.",
      "\"I figured I\u2019m just going to sit in the stands at Madison Square Garden and just shoot the breeze,\" she said. \"It would be a learning experience for me because I had never been up against the Russians and the top girls in the world.

      "The Karolyis defected from Romania, a gymnastics powerhouse, during a U.S. exhibition tour for the sport in 1981 as their homeland experienced economic decline amid the Cold War, according to USA Gymnastics.",
      "They settled in Oklahoma before moving to Houston to set up a gym that became a magnet for American women hoping to compete on the world stage.",
      "Bela eventually served as national team coordinator before stepping down in 2001. M\u00e1rta, 82, took over the role until her retirement in 2016, giving the couple a historic span of influence that included M\u00e1rta's work with Simone Biles.",
      "In 2016, USA Gymnastics purchased Karolyi Ranch and celebrated the couple\u2019s influence on American competitors.",
      "The couple was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2000.

      "The Karolyis' time as top coaches for USA Gymnastics overlapped with the tenure of former team doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving time in federal prison after he pleaded guilty in 2017 to federal charges stemming from his handling of thousands of images of child pornography.",
      "The former doctor was also convicted in Michigan of molesting young girls under the guise of treatment, with more than 265 people, including USA Gymnastics national team stars Biles, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas, saying Nassar victimized them.",
      "In an interview in 2018, M\u00e1rta Karolyi was asked how she felt about allegations that Nassar committed some of his crimes at the USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center at Karolyi Ranch in Texas, where the couple presided over strict training regimens with high expectations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I would say even if they have big names or no names, any child who was violated by Nassar, it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "She emphasized that Nassar was USA Gymnastics\u2019 hire and said that although the facilities bear the couple\u2019s name, USA Gymnastics was its ultimate operator. Bela Karolyi said the couple was unaware of complaints Nassar harassed or assaulted women in the program.",
      "Karolyi said he didn\u2019t like Nassar. \u201cI had the feeling of a snake coming to bite you,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2018, USA Gymnastics terminated its contract with Karolyi Ranch and closed the facility in Walker County, Texas.",
      "Gymnasts who trained with Karolyi offered heartfelt memories of their time with the star coach, though some of those experiences were admittedly conflicted.",
      "Hall of Fame gymnast Dominique Moceanu, a member of the squad that achieved the United States' first women's team gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, said life training under Karolyi came with challenges.",

      "Harding described Karolyi as someone who was quick to offer encouraging words \u2014 \"the somewhat-coach who would bellow out, 'Way to go!' when I did something right or the classic, 'You can do it!' when I was scared.\"",

Forty-five babies were rescued and are receiving medical care, said Bimal Kumar Dubey, a local official.",

      "Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, said China wants the meeting to ease tensions during the transition period. \u201cChina definitely does not want relations with the United States to be thrown into turmoil before Trump formally takes office,\u201d said Shen.",
      "Pacific Rim leaders gathered at the APEC summit are assessing the implications of\u00a0Trump\u2019s return to power\u00a0as U.S. president on Jan. 20.

China also announced plans to host the APEC summit in 2026.",
      "China is seeking Latin America\u2019s metal ores, soybeans, and other commodities, but U.S. officials worry they may also be looking for new U.S.-adjacent military and intelligence outposts. Chinese state-backed media has called those accusations a smear.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 19:42:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. has reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox. The WHO declared the virus' spread a public health emergency in August.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. on Saturday reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox: an individual in California who had recently traveled from eastern Africa.",
      "The case was confirmed by the California Department of Public Health and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The person was treated in San Mateo County based on their travel history and symptoms and is now isolating at home and recovering, the state's health department said in a press release. Public health workers are contacting people who had close contact with the patient, \"but there is no concern or evidence\" that the strain is currently spreading in California or the U.S., the statement said.",
      "The U.S. is the sixth country outside of Africa to have detected the strain, according to the CDC, which can cause more severe disease than the version of the virus that spread widely in 2022.",
      "This strain\u2019s spread across several African countries prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global public health emergency in August, the second time for mpox in two years.",
      "Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral infection that causes painful lesions, often accompanied by flu-like symptoms. It is classified into two distinct groups: the more aggressive strain, clade I, and a somewhat milder strain, clade II.",
      "Clade II was behind the global outbreak in 2022, which resulted in at least 32,000 infections and 58 deaths in the U.S.",
      "Until recently, clade I had not spread beyond Central Africa, where it is considered endemic, and East Africa. But an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to cases in eight other African countries this year. In August, the first known case outside of Africa was confirmed in Sweden. Several days later, Thailand confirmed a case. Both patients had spent time in Africa.",
      "Traveled-related cases have also been detected in Germany, India and the United Kingdom, according to the CDC.",
      "Mpox spreads through direct contact with an infected person, animal or contaminated items like clothing or bedding. The version of clade II that spread in 2022 was passed primarily through sexual contact, particularly among men who have sex with men.",
      "In the current outbreak, clade I has been spreading largely through contact with infected animals and transmission within households, according to disease experts. Two-thirds of the suspected cases from January 2023 to April 2024 were among children ages 15 and under, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a version of the strain, clade Ib, has also spread through sexual contact among female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Congo.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what transmission pathways might look like in the U.S., but some experts anticipate that clade I could spread among the same sexual networks as in 2022.",
      "\u201cI do expect that we will see cases,\" said Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. \"I think it will more likely be in the same population that was more at risk in the 2022-2023 outbreak. For the general population, I think this poses very little risk.\"",
      "Past mpox outbreaks of clade I in Africa have killed up to 10% of people who got sick, but the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a fatality rate of around 5%. That\u2019s compared to a 0.2% global fatality rate for the 2022 outbreak.",
      "However, health officials have said there\u2019s reason to believe that clade I could pose a milder threat in the U.S. than it has in African countries this year, given that malnutrition rates are lower and the health care system is more robust.",
      "The U.S. is also more prepared for an outbreak than it was in 2022. The CDC has instructed doctors to test for mpox and is scanning for both clades at wastewater sites across the country, including some airports.",
      "Additionally, the country has an adequate supply of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine, which is available to men who have sex with men and other high-risk groups. The Department of Health and Human Service says two doses of the vaccine or a previous infection should protect against severe illness from clade I.",
      "The U.S. administered around 1.2 million vaccine doses from May 2022 to January 2023. Health officials hope to expand that coverage, since just 23% of the population at significant risk has been fully vaccinated.",
      "Mpox typically starts with a rash that progresses to small bumps on the skin, followed by fluid-filled blisters that eventually scab over. People may also experience a fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy or swollen lymph nodes.",
      "Some people infected by clade II in the U.S. have described the lesions as exceedingly painful. They have historically appeared on the face, chest, palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, but during the 2022 outbreak, people developed lesions around the genital and anal region or inside the mouth and throat."

    "summary": "Dengue fever has spread at alarming rates this year. New research attributes nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Nearly 12 million cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the Americas this year, close to triple last year\u2019s total.New research suggests that climate change is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s dengue burden.That share is likely to rise significantly in the future, according to the findings.",
      "Nearly 12 million cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the Americas this year, close to triple last year\u2019s total.",
      "New research suggests that climate change is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s dengue burden.",
      "That share is likely to rise significantly in the future, according to the findings.",
      "It has been an exceptionally bad year for dengue fever: Nearly 12 million cases were recorded in the Americas through October, close to triple last year\u2019s total of 4.6 million.",
      "Research being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene on Saturday quantifies the role that climate change has played in the trend, attributing nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to rising temperatures.",
      "By 2050, the research predicts, climate change could be responsible for a 60% increase in the incidence of dengue if emissions continue at pace, with some places \u2014 like parts of Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil \u2014 seeing spikes of up to 200%.",
      "Public health experts have long warned that global warming enables mosquito-borne diseases to spread to new places because it expands the geographic range where the insects that serve as vectors live and thrive. Mallory Harris, a co-author of the new research and a postdoctoral associate in the University of Maryland\u2019s biology department, said her team\u2019s findings build evidence for the significant role climate change has played in dengue\u2019s spread. More broadly, she said, the research highlights the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and specific health consequences.",
      "\u201cDengue is a growing health threat that can cause really severe consequences. It\u2019s something that we need to be preparing for,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe should be expecting these sorts of large epidemics in the future and thinking about ways to then respond to them.\u201d",
      "In the United States and its territories, more than 7,200 dengue cases have been tallied so far this year \u2014 more than double last year\u2019s total and the highest since 2013.",
      "In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory warning of an increased risk of dengue infections. After two locally acquired cases were detected in the Florida Keys, the Monroe County Department of Health issued an alert of its own the next month. To date, 53 locally acquired cases \u2014 meaning they were not associated with travel to a country where dengue is prevalent \u2014\u00a0have been recorded in Florida, according to the CDC. California has recorded 15 such cases.",
      "But the vast majority of U.S. cases this year have been in Puerto Rico, which declared a public health emergency in March amid an alarming rise in dengue infections. More than 4,500 locally acquired dengue cases have been reported in Puerto Rico, compared to less than 1,300 last year and even fewer the year before.",
      "The new research, which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, analyzed temperature records and incidence data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas over an average of 11 years. The researchers compared the data to a simulation of what would have happened during that time period without human-caused climate change.",
      "The resulting estimates are likely at the low end of the spectrum, according to a news release about the findings, because of a lack of dengue data from some areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Plus, predictions for the southern U.S. are difficult to make, given that the virus has only recently emerged as a local threat.",
      "The researchers found that the mosquitoes that carry dengue \u2014 called\u00a0Aedes aegypti \u2014 transmit the virus most efficiently when temperatures are between 68 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They concluded that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, the majority of the countries analyzed would still see climate-driven increases in dengue.",
      "\u201cThe risks of this are going to increase regardless, so we need to be thinking about mitigation,\u201d Harris said, suggesting a focus on vaccines and efforts to curb mosquito populations.",
      "The maker of the only Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for dengue discontinued it earlier this year, according to the CDC.",
      "More than half of people who contract dengue, a viral fever, are asymptomatic. Most of the rest experience mild cases, with symptoms that can include a fever, headache, joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Severe infections \u2014 about 2% of cases in U.S. territories from 2010 to 2020, according to the CDC \u2014 can cause bleeding under the skin, in the nose or in urine or stool, as well as a sudden drop in blood pressure or even death.",
      "The disease is most common in places with humid, tropical climates across Latin America.",
      "Derek Cummings, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in the new research, said it takes \u201csomething that we all knew \u2014 that the temperature is important \u2014 but quantifies how much and how important it is to the changes we\u2019re seeing.\u201d",
      "Cummings, who has published his own research on dengue, added that on a global scale, he foresees a need to prioritize vaccinates, better manage mosquito populations and ensure hospitals and health care providers prepare for a rise in dengue cases.",
      "Harris emphasized that the new research shows how climate change\u2019s consequences affect various parts of the world differently.",
      "\u201cThe greatest impacts of historic climate change on dengue burden were in places like Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, which are not necessarily the places that are the overall hottest. They\u2019re not necessarily the places that are having the greatest increases in heat deaths,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are effects that you might experience in places that are marginally cooler that also need to be taken into account.\u201d"
