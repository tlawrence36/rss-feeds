      "The British actor often played the role of a complex villain.",
      "LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. He was 87.",
      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",
      "The London-born Stamp started his film career with 1962\u2019s seafaring \u201cBilly Budd,\u201d for which he earned Oscar and BAFTA award nominations.",
      "His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's \u201cThe Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" the second of his two BAFTA nominations.",
      "But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d and its sequel \u201cSuperman II\u201d two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",
      "Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021\u2019s \u201cLast Night in Soho,\u201d remembered the actor in an Instagram post as \u201ckind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bill Duke, who starred with Stamp in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey,\u201d said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear of his death.",
      "\u201cHe brought a rare intensity to the screen, but off-screen he carried himself with warmth, grace, and generosity,\u201d he said on Facebook.",
      "Stamp started his acting career on stage in the late 1950s, where he acted in repertory theatre and met Michael Caine, who was five years older than himself. The pair lived together in a flat in central London while looking for their big break.",
      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

It was a performance that would earn the young Stamp, fresh off his Oscar nomination, the best actor award at that year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.",
      "While part of that 1960s British movement, Stamp learned from some of the most seasoned actors from the classical era, including Laurence Olivier.",
      "\u201cI worked with Olivier briefly on my second movie (1962\u2019s \u201cTerm of Trial\"),\u201d Stamp recalled in an interview with the AP in 2013. \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018You should always study your voice.\u2019\u201d Stamp then segued into a spot-on Olivier impersonation, continuing, \u201c\u2018Because, as you get older, your looks go, but your voice will become empowered.\u2019\u201d",
      "His career took a bit of a hiatus from the late 1960s after he missed out on the role of James Bond to replace Sean Connery, that included a years-long stint in India and which saw him embrace a more holistic approach to his self.",
      "It was the unexpected role of General Zod that brought him back to the limelight. He played John Tunstall in 1988's \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d the Galactic Republic leader in 1999's \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequel \u201cThe Phantom Menace,\u201d appeared in the comedies \u201cYes Man\u201d and \u201cGet Smart\u201d in 2008 and delivered voice performances in the video games \u201cHalo 3\u201d and \u201cThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.\u201d",
      "Born in London\u2019s East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton. He married 29-year-old Elizabeth O\u2019Rourke in 2002 at the age of 64 but the couple divorced six years later. Stamp did not have any children.",
      "Stamp retained his looks as the years ticked by, his natural handsomeness hardened by a more grizzled look.",
      "He generally sought to keep his standards high \u2014 to a point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do crappy movies, unless I haven\u2019t got the rent,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cAugust came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,\u201d Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d and the horror sci-fi \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d that premiered this time last year.",

      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d follows the pandemic success of the first in the series, \u201cNobody,\" which released in 2021.

The calm weekend turns anything but as Mansell uncovers a corrupt town.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distributions at Universal Pictures, said he hopes the movie's reaction scores \u2014 a 89% Audience score and B+ CinemaScore \u2014 point \u201cto a long and successful run at the domestic box office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" took the fourth spot during its fourth weekend in theaters, bringing in $8.8 million domestically. The film stumbled at the box office after its initially strong $118 million debut.",

Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look.

      "Tristan Rogers, who played legacy character Robert Scorpio on ABC's \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d died Friday, less than one month after he made a special appearance on the soap opera. He was 79.",
      "\u201cThe entire \u2018General Hospital\u2019 family is heartbroken to hear of Tristan Rogers' passing,\u201d said Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, in a statement. \u201cTristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio).\u201d",
      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",

      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

The 76-year-old singer, composer and pianist was having trouble with his balance but otherwise felt good, he said in an interview last month on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.",

One of the most valuable, he said, was a 1952 Vincent Rapide, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more, according to auction sites.",

People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades.

      "NEW YORK -- When the musical \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d said goodbye to Broadway a decade ago, there were tears and hugs and tons of applause. In the audience of its last show, one woman wasn't entirely buying it.",
      "\u201cI felt then that it wasn\u2019t goodbye forever. I felt we\u2019d be back one day,\u201d says producer Judy Craymer, who had conceived of the show in the 1980s. \u201cI always hoped.\u201d",
      "That one day has become today as the ABBA-fueled, feel-good musical returns to its first home on Broadway, the Winter Garden Theatre. It reopens Thursday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to visit the old place where you went to high school,\u201d says Victor Wallace, who made his Broadway debut in the show in 2012, stayed to the final curtain in 2015 and has returned. \u201cThere's so many backstage stories and people and I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "Fans have fueled the return of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d to make it among the top earners on Broadway, last week grossing $1.57 million over seven previews, fourth behind only \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d",
      "\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d endured plenty during its first Broadway life \u2014 wars, hurricanes, the 2008 financial meltdown, the move to a smaller theater and critics, who never warmed to the show\u2019s high-energy sweetness.",
      "A hit in London \u2014 where it is still playing \u2014 \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d opened in New York just a few weeks after the 2001 terror attacks when there was deep gloom and anxiety.",
      "Christine Sherrill, who recently toured as the show's mom and is now making her Broadway debut in the role, says audiences are responding to another time of stress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a time of peril again, where communities are divided. So to be able to go into some of these cities and have 3,000 people \u2014 who would never find themselves enjoying the same thing outside of the theater \u2014 sitting there all enjoying this communal experience is really interesting.\u201d",
      "The show, featuring more than 20 classic ABBA hits, including \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and \u201cWaterloo,\u201d has been a smash in dozens of countries, including South Korea, Italy, Denmark, South Africa and Spain.",
      "Craymer sees the data about the new flock of theatergoers and notes this \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is popular with groups. \u201cThere were people that had seen it on Broadway \u2014 probably when they were younger \u2014 and now coming back in their 20s and 30s and then bringing their daughters or family.\u201d",

      "The musical prompted Craymer to produce a movie version starring Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, that became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2008. A sequel, \u201cMamma Mia! Here We Go Again,\u201d came out a decade later. ABBA\u2019s music continues to be the backdrop for numerous popular TikTok trends.",
      "In some way mirroring the joy onstage, backstage at \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is a party backstage, too, with milestones celebrated, outings, door decorating contests and gatherings",

      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber said Wednesday he could sentence Weinstein on Sept. 30 \u2014 but only if there\u2019s no retrial on a rape charge that the last jury failed to reach a verdict on.",
      "Weinstein, 73, was convicted in June of forcing oral sex on TV and movie production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006. The charge carries a possible sentence of up to 25 years in prison.",

      "Mann is on board to testify again, they said.",
      "Prosecutors requested a January trial date, citing witness availability and their own caseload. Farber balked at that, saying a January date is too far away and conflicts with another, unrelated trial he\u2019s already scheduled. He proposed having the trial in the fall.",
      "\u201cThe case needs to be tried this year,\u201d Farber said.",

      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character.

It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting.

In the full episode, Swift revealed she worked on the album in Europe while she was on the \u201cEras Tour\" \u2014 flying between dates to record, truly embodying the album's title, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Then she read the track list. The entire album was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback.3. Why orange? The color embodies \u201cwhat was going on in my inner life during this tour,\u201d she said, before referring to Martin as her \u201cmentor.\u201d \u201cThese guys, they're just geniuses,\u201d she said of Martin and Shellback.4. \u201cBangers,\u201d is how she describes the album. She also said, \u201cThere aren't other ones coming,\u201d referring to a surprising double album like in the case of 2024's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d The release is 12 tracks \u2014 that's it.

      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",

      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",

      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to \u201cany provocation\u201d against its territory.",
      "The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.",
      "The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies\u2019 exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.",
      "In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies\u2019 stance of \u201cmilitary confrontation\u201d with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract \u201cany provocation going beyond the boundary line.\u201d",
      "Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea\u2019s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. 25 summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee\u2019s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,\u201d Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday.

      "In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South\u2019s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.",

      "Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea.",

In 2013, more than 6,000 people died and 4,500 villages were affected when a similar cloudburst struck the state.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about cloudbursts:",
      "A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles).",
      "Cloudbursts are sudden and violent, with devastating consequences and widespread destruction, and can be the equivalent of several hours of normal rainfall or longer. The event is the bursting of a cloud and the discharge of its contents at the same time, like a rain bomb.",
      "Several factors contribute to a cloudburst, including warm, moist air rising upward, high humidity, low pressure, instability and convective cloud formation.",
      "Moist air is forced to rise after encountering a hill or mountain. This rising air cools and condenses. Clouds that are large, dense and capable of heavy rainfall form.",
      "Hills or mountains act like barriers and often trap these clouds, so they cannot disperse or move easily. Strong upward currents keep moisture suspended inside the clouds, delaying rainfall.",
      "When the clouds cannot hold the accumulated moisture anymore, they burst and release it all at once.",
      "Cloudbursts thrive in moisture, monsoons and mountains. Regions of India and Pakistan have all three, making them vulnerable to these extreme weather events.",
      "The Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are home to the world\u2019s highest and most famous peaks, spanning multiple countries including India and Pakistan.",
      "The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours.",
      "The South Asian region has traditionally had two monsoon seasons. One typically lasts from June to September, with rains moving southwest to northeast. The other, from roughly October to December, moves in the opposite direction.",
      "But with more planet-warming gases in the air, the rain now only loosely follows this pattern.",
      "This is because the warmer air can hold more moisture from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, and that rain then tends to get dumped all at once. It means the monsoon is punctuated with intense flooding and dry spells, rather than sustained rain throughout.",

      "It recommends afforestation to reduce surface runoff and enhance water absorption, and regular clearing and widening of riverbanks and drainage channels.",
      "Experts say cloudbursts have increased in recent years, partly due to climate change, while damage from associated storms has also increased due to unplanned development in mountain areas.",
      "Climate change has directly amplified the triggers of cloudbursts in Pakistan, especially. Every 1\u00b0C rise allows the air to hold about 7% more moisture, increasing the potential for heavy rainfall in short bursts.",
      "The warming of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea pushes more moisture into the atmosphere.

      "It was not an isolated case, but part of a broader shift in the war where medical evacuation has become increasingly difficult.",
      "\u201cBecause of drones ... that can reach far, the danger is there for the wounded themselves and now for the crews working to get them out,\u201d said Daryna Boiko, the anesthesiologist from the \u201cUlf\u201d medical service of the 108th Da Vinci Wolves Battalion. \u201cThat\u2019s why the main difficulty now is transport.\u201d",
      "In the early months of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, evacuation vehicles could reach almost to the front line, giving the wounded a better chance of survival.",
      "Now, the heavy use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which let an operator see the target before striking, has turned areas up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line into kill zones. Medics say they have not treated gunshot wounds for months, and most injuries now come from FPVs.",
      "The drones are the most feared weapon, both because of their precision and because they reduce survival chances for those already injured by complicating the evacuation.",
      "For Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered army, that makes preserving crew even harder.",
      "The growing use of FPVs has also made moving the wounded between points more difficult, said the commander of the 59th Brigade medical unit with call sign Buhor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cEverything is getting harder \u2014 the work has to be more mobile, the way we operate changes and the level of safety changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether those conditions have increased mortality among the wounded, he replied: \u201cSignificantly. There\u2019s nothing you can do. Everything burns from those FPVs \u2014 everything, even tanks.\u201d",
      "He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade \u2014 a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When it blasts, a jet of molten metal and fragments penetrate the cabin at extreme temperatures. The impact can cause anything from minor cuts and burns to severe wounds, including amputations, depending on where the fragments hit and their size.",
      "Buhor said self-aid and self-evacuation are now heavily emphasized during training, but the existence of the kill zone means soldiers can be stuck in position for days or weeks \u2014 especially if a wound is not immediately life-threatening.",
      "When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. It was the work of a fellow soldier \u2014 and an example of effective self-aid, Buhor said.",
      "Fursov, 38, was wounded on Aug. 4 by an explosive dropped from a drone, but he didn\u2019t reach a medical post until five days later. To get to safety, he had to walk several kilometers. A small wooden cross he wore under his clothes the whole time now hangs against his chest.",

      "Two of their children had already made the crossing, via the Gulf of Aden and then war-torn Yemen. Yosef\u2019s brother is now in jail in Yemen for entering that country illegally. His sister made it to Saudi Arabia, also illegally, which means it will be difficult for her to leave.",
      "On August 3, 2025, Yosef and five friends from his town of Adi Qeyih boarded a boat bound for Yemen. That night, it capsized. Only 56 people of the nearly 200 people on board survived. Yosef was not one of them.",

Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.\u201d",
      "The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. When the conflict started in 2020, he was in 7th Grade, and he dropped out to join the Tigray armed forces. When the ceasefire was signed in 2022, he came back home, but couldn\u2019t find a job. After three years, he was desperate.",

      "\u201cA victory for either right-wing candidate could have grave repercussions for Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous and impoverished communities,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group. \u201cBoth candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.\u201d",
      "All 130 seats in Bolivia\u2019s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house.",
      "If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct. 19 for the first time since Bolivia's 1982 return to democracy.",

      "Bolivians are voting for a new president and parliament in elections.",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia's presidential vote headed to an unprecedented runoff after elections Sunday that ended more than two decades of left-wing dominance in the Andean nation but signaled voters' trepidation about a major lurch to the right.",
      "A dark horse centrist, Sen. Rodrigo Paz, drew more votes than the right-wing front-runners, although not enough to secure an outright victory, early results showed.",
      "Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition\u2019s push for tough austerity to rescue Bolivia from a looming economic collapse, will face off against right-wing former President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, who finished second. Bolivia holds the presidential runoff \u2014 its first since its 1982 return to democracy \u2014 on Oct. 19.",
      "\u201cThis economic model must change,\" Paz declared to crowds who cheered and chanted, \u201cRenewal!\"",
      "Paz\u2019s campaign gained unexpected traction in recent weeks as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing whose supporters see him as a bold leader willing to stand up to corruption in the security forces.",
      "With over 91% of the ballots counted Sunday, Paz received 32.8% of the votes cast. Quiroga secured 26.4%. Candidates needed to surpass 50%, or 40% with a 10-point margin of victory, to avoid a runoff.",
      "Addressing fans and flanked by family as confetti hearts sprayed from the ceiling, Quiroga congratulated Paz on his lead.",
      "\u201cWhat happened is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cBolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.\u201d",
      "The results delivered a stunning blow to Bolivia's hegemonic Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed Bolivia almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftist leaders that swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s.",
      "The official MAS candidate, Eduardo del Castillo, finished sixth with just 3.2% of the vote. A leftist candidate considered to be the party's best hope, 36-year-old Senate president Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, captured 8% of the vote.",
      "During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country\u2019s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs.",
      "But the maverick leader\u2019s increasingly high-handed attempts to prolong his presidency \u2014 along with allegations of sexual relations with underage girls \u2014 soured public opinion against him.",
      "Simmering discontent turned into a tidal wave of outrage as Bolivia\u2019s once-stable economy imploded under Morales\u2019 prot\u00e9g\u00e9-turned-rival, President Luis Arce.",
      "Annual inflation rate has soared from 2% less than two years ago to 25% as of last month. A scarcity of fuel has paralyzed the country. A desperate shortage of U.S. dollars needed to pay for essential imports like wheat has crippled the economy.",
      "As the crisis accelerated, MAS leaders traded blame. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite.",
      "In perhaps the most visible sign of how fed up Bolivians are with the party, leftist politicians casting their ballots across Bolivia on Sunday faced barrages of boos, insults and thrown objects.",
      "Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his tropical stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president.",
      "He has branded Rodr\u00edguez a traitor for competing and encouraged his supporters to register their anger at his exclusion by casting null-and-void ballots.",
      "His followers appeared to heed his calls: An unusually high proportion of votes, 19%, were deemed invalid. Usually the share of blank and null votes doesn't exceed 6%.",

      "Solorza is racing against the clock to gather 35,000 signatures by Aug. 18, a requirement for him to run as an independent candidate. He positions himself as a \u201cpoint of balance\u201d between the far right and the far left \u2014 a fierce ideological battle that dominates Chile\u2019s political scene.",
      "\u201cI listen with my heart,\u201d Solorza told The Associated Press, adding that his condition allows him to offer a softer communication style.",
      "Should he enter the electoral race, his platform will focus on greater inclusion, improved healthcare and education, and enhanced security \u2014 a main concern of citizens who have been grappling with an unprecedented crisis of violence in recent years.",
      "Chile will choose its new president on Nov. 16, with the campaign so far defined by the mutual attacks between the two main contestants: The far-right Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who lost to current leftist president Gabriel Boric in 2021, and Jeannette Jara, the ruling coalition\u2019s communist nominee.",
      "With three months remaining until the election, polls show Kast and Jara vying for the top two spots. This scenario suggests they would face each other in a second-round runoff on Dec. 14.",
      "Solorza argues that his candidacy offers a middle ground between political extremes, while working toward a \u201cmore inclusive country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life breaking down prejudices, as an actor, as a worker and as a citizen,\u201d he said last month when announcing his plans to run as an independent candidate. \u201cWe all deserve the same opportunities.\u201d",
      "The actor hopes his candidacy will give greater visibility to people with Down syndrome and other disabilities. While it's unlikely he will secure the necessary support to run for president \u2014 he has collected a little over 600 of the 35,000 signatures required \u2014 he sees his political foray as a success.",
      "Solorza keeps a tight schedule, balancing an acting career with a day job at a construction company. In his limited free time, he spends time visiting Congress, talking with members of the Parliament and meeting with constituents to promote his campaign.",
      "On the streets of Huechuraba, a quiet and green neighborhood in the northern part of Chile's capital, Solorza is often greeted by supporters, fans, and workers from restaurants and caf\u00e9s where he is a regular. Always smiling, he walks slowly, making time for anyone who wants a photo or a brief chat.",
      "In Valpara\u00edso \u2014 a coastal town about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Santiago \u2014 Chileans show up at the Parliament to express their support. \u201cGood luck with the signatures,\u201d one supporter said last week. \u201cLet it be the people who ultimately decide our future.\u201d",

      "The attempt at a political debut is just the latest in a long line of barriers Solorza has overcome.",
      "He was born and raised in the 1980s, a time with far less knowledge about Down syndrome than today. His mother, Jenny Solorza, recalls his early years as \u201cvery dark,\u201d because doctors never provided a clear diagnosis for their son, leading them to search for information on their own.",

      "The Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval masterpiece depicting the 1066 Norman conquest of England, is set for a new chapter",
      "BAYEUX, France -- For centuries, the storytelling masterpiece has been a source of wonder and fascination. In vivid and gruesome detail, the 70-meter (230-foot) embroidered cloth recounts how a fierce duke from France conquered England in 1066, reshaping British and European history.",
      "The Bayeux Tapestry, with its scenes of sword-wielding knights in ferocious combat and King Harold of England's famous death, pierced by an arrow to an eye, has since the 11th century served as a sobering parable of military might, vengeance, betrayal and the complexity of Anglo-French relations, long seeped with blood and rivalry but also affection and cooperation.",
      "Now, the medieval forerunner of today's comic strips, commissioned as propaganda for the Normandy duke William known as \u201cthe Conqueror\u201d after he took the English throne from Harold, is being readied for a new narrative mission.",
      "Next year, the fragile artistic and historic treasure will be gingerly transported from its museum in Bayeux, Normandy, to star in a blockbuster exhibition in London's British Museum, from September 2026 to July 2027.",
      "Its first U.K. outing in almost 1,000 years will testify to the warming latest chapter in ties across the English Channel that chilled with the U.K.'s acrimonous departure from the European Union in 2020. The loan was announced in July when French President Emmanuel Macron became the first EU head of state to pay a state visit to the U.K. since Brexit.",
      "Bayeux Museum curator Antoine Verney says the cross-Channel trip will be a home-coming of sorts for the tapestry, because historians widely believe that it was embroidered in England, using woolen threads on linen canvas, and because William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was such a major juncture in English history, seared into the U.K.'s collective consciousness.",
      "\u201cFor the British, the date \u2014 the only date \u2014 that all of them know is 1066,\u201d Verney said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Moving an artwork so unwieldy \u2014 made from nine pieces of linen fabric stitched together and showing 626 characters, 37 buildings, 41 ships and 202 horses and mules in a total of 58 scenes \u2014 is further complicated by its great age and the wear-and-tear of time.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk. The goal is for those risks to be as carefully calculated as possible,\u201d said Verney, the curator.",
      "Believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror\u2019s half-brother, to decorate a new cathedral in Bayeux in 1077, the treasure is thought to have remained there, mostly stored in a wooden chest and almost unknown, for seven centuries, surviving the French Revolution, fires and other perils.",
      "Since then, only twice is the embroidery known to have been exhibited outside of the Normandy city: Napoleon Bonaparte had it shown off in Paris' Louvre Museum from late 1803 to early 1804. During World War II, it was displayed again in the Louvre in late 1944, after Allied forces that had landed in Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, of that year had fought onward to Paris and liberated it.",

      "The work, seen by more than 15 million visitors in its Bayeux museum since 1983, \u201chas the unique characteristic of being both monumental and very fragile,\u201d Verney said. \u201cThe textile fibers are 900 years old. So they have naturally degraded simply due to age. But at the same time, this is a work that has already traveled extensively and been handled a great deal.\u201d",
      "During the treasure's stay in the U.K., its museum in Bayeux will be getting a major facelift costing tens of millions of euros (dollars). The doors will close to visitors from Sept. 1 this year, with reopening planned for October 2027, when the embroidery will be re-housed in a new building, encased on an inclined 70-meter long table that Verney said will totally transform the viewing experience.",
      "How, exactly, the treasure will be transported to the U.K. isn't yet clear.",
      "\u201cThe studies required to allow its transfer to London and its exhibition at the British Museum are not finished, are under discussion, and are being carried out between the two governments,\u201d Verney said.",
      "But he expressed confidence that it will be in safe hands.",
      "\u201cHow can one imagine, in my view, that the British Museum would risk damaging, through the exhibition, this work that is a major element of a shared heritage?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the British could take risks that would endanger this major element of art history and of world heritage.\u201d",

      "Relations between Beirut and Damascus remain tense \u2014 as they have been for decades past, a time during which Syria failed to treat its smaller neighbor as a sovereign nation",
      "BEIRUT -- A lot has happened in just a year on both sides of the Lebanon-Syria border. A lightning offensive by Islamist insurgents in Syria toppled longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and brought a new government in place in Damascus.",
      "In Lebanon, a bruising war with Israel dealt a serious blow to Hezbollah \u2014 the Iran-backed and Assad-allied Shiite Lebanese militant group that had until recently been a powerful force in the Middle East \u2014 and a U.S.-negotiated deal has brought a fragile ceasefire.",
      "Still, even after the fall of the 54-year Assad family rule, relations between Beirut and Damascus remain tense \u2014 as they have been for decades past, with Syria long failing to treat its smaller neighbor as a sovereign nation.",
      "Recent skirmishes along the border have killed and wounded several people, both fighters and civilians, including a four-year-old Lebanese girl. Beirut and Damascus have somewhat coordinated on border security, but attempts to reset political relations have been slow. Despite visits to Syria by two heads of Lebanon's government, no Syrian official has visited Lebanon.",
      "Here is what's behind the complicated relations.",
      "Many Syrians have resented Hezbollah for wading into Syria's civil war in defense of Assad's government. Assad's fall sent them home, but many Lebanese now fear cross-border attacks by Syria's Islamic militants.",
      "There are new restrictions on Lebanese entering Syria, and Lebanon has maintained tough restrictions on Syrians entering Lebanon.",
      "The Lebanese also fear that Damascus could try to bring Lebanon under a new Syrian tutelage.",
      "Syrians have long seen Lebanon as a staging ground for anti-Syria activities, including hosting opposition figures before Hafez Assad \u2014 Bashar Assad's father \u2014 ascended to power in a bloodless 1970 coup.",
      "In 1976, Assad senior sent his troops to Lebanon, allegedly to bring peace as Lebanon was hurtling into a civil war that lasted until 1990. Once that ended, Syrian forces \u2014 much like a colonial power \u2014 remained in Lebanon for another 15 years.",
      "A signature of the Assad family rule, Syria's dreaded security agents disappeared and tortured dissidents to keep the country under their control. They did the same in Lebanon.",
      "\u201cSyrians feel that Lebanon is the main gateway for conspiracies against them,\u201d says Lebanese political analyst Ali Hamadeh.",
      "It took until 2008 for the two countries to agree to open diplomatic missions, marking Syria's first official recognition of Lebanon as an independent state since it gained independence from France in 1943.",
      "The move came after the 2005 truck-bombing assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri that many blamed on Damascus. Two months later, Syria pulled its troops out of Lebanon under international pressure, ending 29 years of near-complete domination of its neighbor.",
      "When Syria\u2019s own civil war erupted in 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled across the border, making crisis-hit Lebanon the host of the highest per capita population of refugees in the world. Once in Lebanon, the refugees complained about discrimination, including curfews for Syrian citizens in some areas.",

Damascus is asking Beirut to hand them over to continue their prison terms in Syria, but Lebanese judicial officials say Beirut won't release any attackers and that each must be studied and resolved separately.",
      "In July, family members of the detainees rallied along a border crossing, demanding their relatives be freed. The protest came amid reports that Syrian troops could deploy foreign fighters in Lebanon, which Damascus officials denied.",
      "Another obstacle is Lebanon\u2019s demand that Syrian refugees go back home now that Assad is gone. About 716,000 Syrian refugees are registered with the U.N. refugee agency, while hundreds of thousands more are unregistered in Lebanon, which has a population of about 5 million.",
      "Syria is also demanding the return of billions of dollars worth of deposits of Syrians trapped in Lebanese banks since Lebanon's historic financial meltdown in 2019.",
      "The worst post-Assad border skirmishes came in mid-March, when Syrian authorities said Hezbollah members crossed the border and kidnapped and killed three Syrian soldiers. The Lebanese government and army said the clash was between smugglers and that Hezbollah wasn't involved.",
      "Days later, Lebanese and Syrian defense ministers flew to Saudi Arabia and signed an agreement on border demarcation and boosting their coordination.",
      "In July, rumors spread in Lebanon, claiming the northern city of Tripoli would be given to Syria in return for Syria giving up the Golan Heights to Israel. And though officials dismissed the rumors, they illustrate the level of distrust between the neighbors.",
      "Beirut was also angered by Syria's appointment this year of a Lebanese army officer \u2014 Abdullah Shehadeh, who defected in 2014 from Lebanon to join Syrian insurgents \u2014 as the head of security in Syria\u2019s central province of Homs that borders northeastern Lebanon.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.",
      "In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet\u2019s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.",
      "Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.",

      "Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.",
      "A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,\u201d Keoleian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.\u201d",

      "Ernst has called the EV initiative a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and \"a textbook example of waste,\u201d citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.",
      "\u201cYou always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that\u2019s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,\" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.",
      "\u201cFor now,\u201d she added, \"gas-powered vehicles \u2014 use some ethanol in them \u2014 I think is wonderful.\u201d",
      "Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.",
      "Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project \"has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.\u201d",
      "The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was \u201cvery modest\" and not unexpected.",
      "\u201cThe production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,\u201d spokesperson Kim Frum said.",
      "The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.",
      "The \u201cDeliver for America\u201d plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.",

    "story": [
      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.",
      "Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "\u201cI think anyone can install this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. It doesn\u2019t require a technical degree.\u201d",
      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",

      "China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,\u201d Oliver said, adding: \u201cAs this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.\"",

      "Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.S. opposed cutting plastic production or banning chemical additives in the treaty. The U.S. supported provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment.",
      "Saudi Arabia said both drafts lacked balance, and Saudi and Kuwaiti negotiators said the latest proposal gave more weight to the views of other nations.",
      "That draft, released early Friday, did not include a limit on plastic production, but recognized that current levels of production and consumption are \u201cunsustainable\u201d and global action is needed. New language had been added to say these levels exceeded current waste management capacities and are projected to increase further, \u201cthereby necessitating a coordinated global response to halt and reverse such trends.\u201d",
      "The objective of the treaty was revamped to state that the accord would be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics. It talked about reducing plastic products containing \u201ca chemical or chemicals of concern to human health or the environment,\u201d as well as reducing of single-use or short-lived plastic products.",
      "It was a much better, more ambitious text, though not perfect. Each country came to Geneva with a lot of \u201cred lines,\u201d said Magnus Heunicke, the Danish environment minister. Denmark holds the rotating presidency of the Council of Europe.",

      "The U.S. has seen a record increase in tariff income, with a 273% rise in customs revenue from last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. saw a 273% increase \u2014 or $21 billion \u2014 in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government\u2019s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.",
      "Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.",
      "If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.",
      "While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue \u2014 estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump\u2019s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result \u201c in only modest reductions in federal debt.\u201d",
      "In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.",

      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",

      "\u201cI think I told Gibbons \u2018All right, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here right away,\u2019\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "The Mets might have themselves a keeper.",
      "The 24-year-old right-hander made a highlight reel double play to escape the third inning and earned the win in his major league debut on Saturday when he tossed 5 1/3 scoreless frames to help the Mets to a much-needed 3-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners.",
      "McLean allowed two hits, walked four and struck out eight in the longest scoreless outing by a Mets starter since June 11, when David Peterson shut out the Washington Nationals. New York\u2019s rotation entered Saturday averaging 4.96 innings per appearance.",
      "\u201cWe needed that \u2014 as a team, as an organization, given where we\u2019re at and how hard it\u2019s been for us,\u201d Mendoza said after the Mets won for just the third time in 17 games.",
      "McLean showed off a five-pitch arsenal that included a high-70s curveball, a high-80s sweeper, a 90-mph cutter and sinkers and fastballs both measured in the high 90s. He limited the Mariners to one hit in 10 plate appearances with a runner on base.",
      "The former two-way player \u2014 a third-round pick of the Mets out of Oklahoma State in 2023 \u2014 also displayed his athleticism in the third. McLean walked J.P. Crawford and Cole Young before Cal Raleigh\u2019s one-out single loaded the bases for Julio Rodr\u00edguez, who has 10 homers since the All-Star Break.",
      "But McLean made a no-look, behind-the-back grab of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s comebacker and began the 1-4-3 double play. First baseman Pete Alonso grinned widely as he looked at the ball in his glove and McLean smiled while walking off the mound.",
      "\u201cI try to stay as athletic as possible,\u201d McLean said. \u201cBut I think that play was majority luck, honestly.\u201d",
      "McLean allowed just two more baserunners over his final nine batters. He is the seventh Mets starter to throw at least five scoreless innings in his major league debut and the sixth to strike out at least eight batters.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Georgia teenager Mason Howell capped a productive summer before his senior year of high school by winning the U.S. Amateur at The Olympic Club on Sunday just two months after competing in his first U.S. Open.",
      "Howell, who turned 18 in June, raced out to a big lead over Tennessee teenager Jackson Herrington on the opening 18 holes and went on to win the 36-hole final 7 and 6 to surpass Tiger Woods and become the third youngest U.S. Amateur champion ever. Only Byeong Hun An, who won at age 17 in 2009, and Danny Lee, who won a month after his 18th birthday in 2008, were younger.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all jumbled together,\u201d Howell said of his emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a great week. To have my name next to these other names on this trophy is unbelievable. To be next to somebody named Tiger is an unreal feeling.\u201d",
      "Howell won it with a par to halve the 30th hole, ending the most-lopsided final since Bryson DeChambeau also beat Derek Bard 7 and 6 in 2015. The win earned Howell invitations to the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open next year. He also got a spot in the Walker Cup matches down the coast at Cypress Point in September.",
      "\u201cI felt like I always had it,\" Howell said of his play this summer. \"It\u2019s self-belief. I knew it was in me. I just needed to walk with some confidence and I think that would translate to good golf and staying positive.",
      "This was the first U.S. Amateur final featuring two teenagers since Matt Fitzpatrick bested Oliver Goss in 2013 and Howell showed the composure of a much more experienced golfer by repeatedly making clutch putts while Herrington made repeated mistakes.",
      "Howell won 11 holes, eight of them with pars. He also responded after all four holes he lost, winning the following hole each time.",
      "Howell burst onto the scene when he qualified for the U.S. Open this year with rounds of 63-63 from the Atlanta sectional. He failed to make the cut at Oakmont but used that experience this week at The Olympic Club.",
      "He was one of 17 players to advance from a 20-man playoff to make the match play portion of the tournament, where he won all six matches.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I have known how good he is for a long time,\u201d said his father, Robert Howell. \u201cHe\u2019s had a phenomenal breakout summer.\u201d",
      "Howell won five of six holes on the front nine of the opening 18 holes \u2014 including an eagle at No. 7 \u2014 to take a four-hole lead. He increased the lead to five with a birdie on the par-5 16th hole as his steady putting helped keep Herrington at bay.",

      "Jaxson Dart shined in his preseason home debut for the New York Giants as they beat the Jets 31-12",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Getting snaps with the first-team offense, then throwing for a touchdown and running for another with the backups, Jaxson Dart shined in his new home stadium debut for the New York Giants as part of a 31-12 victory against the Jets on Saturday night in each team's second preseason game.",
      "The rookie first-round pick whom the Giants envision as their long-term franchise quarterback got a chance to show a little bit of how he could contribute in the near future by subbing in for starter Russell Wilson mid-drive and connecting with Theo Johnson on a 30-yard pass. Dart capped a 71-yard second half-opening drive with a TD throw to Greg Dulcich and scored on a goal-line sneak to finish another after completing 13 consecutive passes.",
      "Dart was 14 of 16 for 137 yards, delivering on the hype under the lights at MetLife Stadium before giving way to Jameis Winston.",
      "\u201cI thought guys were making great plays for me,\u201d Dart said. \u201cI was just trying to distribute the ball to the playmakers.\u201d",
      "Wilson had his own highlight, throwing his so-called \u201cmoon ball\u201d to undrafted free agent Beaux Collins for an 80-yard gain.",
      "\u201cJust great vision by Russ to lay it up there,\u201d coach Brian Daboll said. \u201cWhat a great ball by Russ, right? An 80-yard bomb, he dropped it in the bucket.\u201d",
      "The 36-had another intercepted because of a miscommunication with Collins, his final throw of a 4 of 7, 108-yard performance.",
      "\u201cWe were on two different pages, I guess,\u201d said Wilson, who is glad to get some extended playing time with his new team. \u201cThe good thing is it happened in the preseason. You get to see it and talk about it, and that\u2019s why you play these games, man. You just get better, you learn and we all work together.\u201d",
      "While the Giants (2-0) got clicking, questions remain on offense for Justin Fields and the Jets (1-1). He left after two run-heavy series 1 of 5 for 4 yards, with Nick Folk's 38-yard field goal the only points the starters got on the board.",
      "\"We were sloppy, and the guys know that,\" first-year coach Aaron Glenn said. \u201cOverall, in general, it wasn\u2019t good enough. I don\u2019t care if it was the starting offense, I don\u2019t care if it was the second-team offense, the third-team offense.\u201d",
      "That performance came after Fields, signed to a two-year, $40 million deal to replace Aaron Rodgers, was 3 of 4 for 42 yards and a 13-yard TD run in the exhibition opener at Green Bay last Saturday. Fields said it \u201cwasn't up to our standards.\u201d",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",
      "Valuable minerals and other materials found on the moon and in asteroids could lead to future conflicts as nations look to exploit new technologies and energy sources.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cTo have a base on the moon, we need energy and some of the key locations on the moon. ... We want to get there first and claim that for America.\u201d",
      "The moon is rich in a material known as helium 3, which scientists believe could be used in nuclear fusion to generate huge amounts of energy. While that technology is still decades away, control over the moon in the intervening years could determine which countries emerge as superpowers, according to Joseph Rooke, a London-based cybersecurity expert who has worked in the U.K. defense industry and is now director of risk insights at the firm Recorded Future.",

      "\u201cIt has kept expanding military strength in space, created space military alliances, and attempted to turn space into a war zone,\u201d Liu said. \u201cChina urges the U.S. to stop spreading irresponsible rhetoric, stop expanding military build-up in space, and make due contribution to upholding the lasting peace and security in space.\u201d",
      "Nations are scrambling to create their own rocket and space programs to exploit commercial prospects and ensure they aren't dependent on foreign satellites.

Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",

      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",
      "The same is happening in other states.",
      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",
      "The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",

      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",
      "How the human brain is wired also plays a role.",
      "\u201cYou can see the bottle being recycled. That\u2019s visible. Whereas carbon emissions, that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t associate emissions with flying,\u201d said Jiaying Zhao, who teaches psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",
      "Of course, there is also a lot of misleading information. For example, some companies tout the recycling they do while not telling the public about pollution that comes from their overall operations.",
      "\u201cThere has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.",
      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",

      "Planes emit a lot of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, also greenhouse gases. Additionally, planes emit contrails, or vapor trails that prevent planet-warming gases from escaping into space. A round-trip economy-class flight on a 737 from New York to Los Angeles produces more than 1,300 pounds of emissions per passenger, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.",
      "Skipping that single flight saves about as much carbon as swearing off eating all types of meat a year, or living without a car for more than three months, according to U.N. estimates.",
      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important. That is because those appliances have a relatively small impact compared to other things, such plane flights and dogs, so improving on them, while beneficial, has a much more limited influence.",

      "Farmers in Kenya face challenges with elephants raiding crops and sometimes causing harm",
      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",
      "Changing crops can also make a difference. Elephants love maize and watermelons. But sesame? Blegh.",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

      "A host of European leaders will accompany Zelenskyy to Washington.",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump on Sunday teased what he said would be a \"big day\" as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a host of European leaders prepared for a White House meeting that Trump said can end Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"almost immediately.\"",
      "Monday's Washington, D.C., summit follows Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. Since that meeting, Trump appears to have dropped his demand for Russia to agree to an immediate ceasefire and is now pressuring Kyiv to accept territorial concessions to secure a peace deal.",
      "On Sunday, Trump explicitly said Ukraine will not regain Crimea -- occupied by Russia in 2014. The president also repeated that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO, though White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and Zelenskyy have hinted at alternative security guarantees involving the U.S.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote on social media on Sunday.",
      "The president has previously incorrectly framed Ukraine as the initiator of the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. That invasion followed Moscow's cross-border aggression in 2014, which saw Russia seize Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region.",
      "\"Big day at the White House tomorrow,\" Trump added. \"I've never had so many European leaders at one time. It's my great honor to host them!!!\"",
      "\"NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE,\" Trump added. \"Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Trump is expected to greet Zelenskyy outside the West Wing at 1 p.m. ET, according to a schedule published by the White House, after which they will hold a bilateral meeting. The president is scheduled to take photos with European leaders at around 2:30 p.m. ET and hold a multilateral meeting with them at 3 p.m.",
      "Vice President JD Vance will also attend the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, a source familiar with the plans confirmed to ABC News. Vance was part of the dramatic Oval Office meeting in February during which the vice president publicly berated Zelenskyy over his alleged ingratitude for U.S. wartime support.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post to social media that he had arrived in Washington on Sunday night, expressing his gratitude to Trump for hosting the planned meeting. \"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "\"And peace must be lasting,\" he added, noting Moscow's 2014 aggression plus the failure of the international community to enforce the 1994 Budapest Memorandum -- which was also signed by Russia -- that offered Ukraine \"security assurances\" in exchange for Kyiv surrendering its Cold War-era nuclear arsenal.",
      "\"Ukrainians are fighting for their land, for their independence,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Friday's summit in Alaska ended with Russia demanding that Ukraine cede the entirety of its contested and fortified eastern Donetsk region in exchange for an end to the fighting, two sources told ABC News.",
      "Trump then challenged Kyiv to \"make the deal\" and lavished praise on Putin. \"Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not,\" Trump told Fox News after the meeting. Putin, he added, is a \"strong guy\" and \"tough as hell.\"",
      "A host of European leaders will accompany Zelenskyy at the White House meeting. European leaders have backed Zelenskyy and Ukraine's positions during the Trump administration's pressure campaign on Kyiv.",
      "Those confirmed as attending are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.",

      "Ahead of last week's summit in Alaska, European leaders echoed Zelenskyy's position that a ceasefire must precede peace negotiations, that security guarantees for Kyiv must be put in place and that only Ukraine can make the final decision on any territorial concessions.",
      "On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that he and his fellow European leaders will be traveling to Washington both to support Zelenskyy and \"to defend European interests\" at a \"very serious\" moment for the continent's security.",
      "\"If we are weak today with Russia, we prepare the wars of tomorrow,\" Macron said, adding that Moscow had \"never\" respected past \"promises of non-aggression.\"",
      "The nature of Western security guarantees for Ukraine will be a key topic for discussion, Macron said, explaining to journalists a two-pronged approach by which Ukraine's military would be bolstered and a Western \"reassurance force\" would be deployed to Ukraine to act as a deterrent against renewed Russian attacks.",
      "Any concessions will spark intense debate within Ukraine. The country's constitution dictates that any changes to the national borders must be approved by an all-Ukraine referendum.",
      "Kyiv's ambitions to join both NATO and the European Union are also enshrined in the constitution, meaning it may need to be amended for Ukraine to accept exclusion from either bloc.",
      "\"Territorial concessions are impossible,\" Oleksandr Mrezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News. \"Under the present circumstances, we need a ceasefire and security guarantees to prevent Putin from violating the ceasefire.\"",
      "\"In my opinion, Putin's idea about a 'peace treaty' instead of a ceasefire is extremely dangerous and unacceptable for both Ukraine and the U.S.,\" he added.",
      "\"That the U.S. offers to be engaged in security guarantees is great news for us, but we don't know yet what it will be in practice,\" Merezhko said. \"I personally continue to believe that the best option for all -- Ukraine, the U.S. and the EU -- is NATO membership for Ukraine.\"",
      "\"Putin is afraid of only one thing -- NATO,\" Merezhko added. \"That's why it's the most reliable and effective security guarantee for us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine continued long-range attacks overnight into Monday.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 140 drones and four missiles in the country, of which 88 drones were shot down or suppressed. Missile and drone impacts were reported across 25 locations in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Kyiv regions, the air force said.",
      "At least seven people, including a child, were killed when a Russian drone impacted an apartment complex in Kharkiv, local officials said.",

      "Flight attendants were poised to walk off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking out the flight attendants from airports. The actions threaten to impact about 130,000 travelers a day.",
      "Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu on Friday urged both sides to work with federal mediators \u201cand get a deal done.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime is precious and Canadians are counting on you,\u201d Hajdu said in a statement.",
      "The Canadian carrier already started canceling flights Thursday. It expects to call off 500 flights by the end of Friday and almost all of its flights by Saturday morning. A complete shutdown threatens to impact about 130,000 people a day, and it could affect some 25,000 Canadians a day who may become stranded abroad.",
      "By Friday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 128 domestic flights and 194 international flights that were scheduled to depart on Friday and Saturday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. On Thursday, when the airline said it was beginning it\u2019s \u201cphased wind down\u201d of most operations, 18 domestic flights and four international flights were canceled.",

      "\u201cAt this point, it's just a waiting game,\u201d he said.",
      "Laroche said he was initially upset over the union's decision to go on strike, but that he had a change of heart after reading about the key issues at the center of the contract negotiations, including the issue of wages.",

      "The future of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies with implications for security in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies, raising implications for security in the Middle East and becoming the latest snag to vex relations between the U.S. and key partners like France, Britain and Italy.",
      "At issue is the peacekeeping operation known as UNIFIL, whose mandate expires at the end of August and will need to be renewed by the U.N. Security Council to continue. It was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion, and its mission was expanded following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah.",
      "The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. lawmakers, some of whom now hold prominent roles in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration or wield new influence with the White House.",
      "Trump administration political appointees came into office this year with the aim of shutting down UNIFIL as soon as possible. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah\u2019s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing.",
      "After securing major cuts in U.S. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions.",
      "It\u2019s another step as the Trump administration drastically pares back its foreign affairs priorities and budget, including expressing skepticism of international alliances and cutting funding to U.N. agencies and missions. The transatlantic divide also has been apparent on issues ranging from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine conflict to trade, technology and free speech issues.",
      "Israel has for years sought an end to UNIFIL\u2019s mandate, and renewal votes have often come after weeks of political wrangling. Now, the stakes are particularly high after last year\u2019s war and more vigorous opposition in Washington.",
      "European nations, notably France and Italy, have objected to winding down UNIFIL. With the support of Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "Israel also reluctantly agreed to an extension, they said.",
      "The European argument was that prematurely ending UNIFIL before the Lebanese army is able to fully secure the border area would create a vacuum that Hezbollah could easily exploit.",
      "The French noted that when a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali was terminated before government troops were ready to deal with security threats, Islamic extremists moved in.",
      "With the U.S. easing off, the issue ahead of the U.N. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides.",
      "French officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The final French draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, does not include a date for UNIFIL's withdrawal, which U.S. officials say is required for their support. Instead, it would extend the peacekeeping mission for one year and indicates the U.N. Security Council's \u201cintention to work on a withdrawal.\u201d",
      "But even if the mandate is renewed, the peacekeeping mission might be scaled down for financial reasons, with the U.N. system likely facing drastic budget cuts, said a U.N. official, who was not authorized to comment to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said an option being considered was reducing UNIFIL\u2019s numbers while boosting its technological means to monitor the situation on the ground.",

Israel, meanwhile, has accused the peacekeepers of turning a blind eye to Hezbollah\u2019s military activities in southern Lebanon and lobbied for its mandate to end.",
      "Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst and founder of the Israeli think tank Alma Research and Education Center, said UNIFIL has played a \u201cdamaging role with regard to the mission of disarming Hezbollah in south Lebanon.\u201d",

Hezbollah is now under increasing pressure to give up the rest of its weapons.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said UNIFIL continues to discover unauthorized weapons, including rocket launchers, mortar rounds and bomb fuses, this week, which it reported to the Lebanese army.",
      "Under the U.S.- and France-brokered ceasefire, Israel and Hezbollah were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese army taking control in conjunction with UNIFIL.

      "Instead, Trump was the one who stood down, dropping his demand for a ceasefire in favor of pursuing a full peace accord \u2014 a position that aligns with Putin's.",
      "After calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote as he flew home from Friday's meeting in Alaska that it had been \u201cdetermined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d",
      "It was a dramatic reversal that laid bare the challenges of dealing with Putin, a cunning adversary, as well as the complexities of a conflict that Trump had repeatedly boasted during his campaign that he could solve within 24 hours.",
      "Few details have emerged about what the two leaders discussed or what constituted the progress they both touted. The White House did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday.",
      "While European leaders were relieved that Trump did not agree to a deal that ceded territory or otherwise favored Moscow, the summit allowed Putin to reclaim his place on the world stage and may have bought Russia more time to push forward with its offensive in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re back to where we were before without him having gone to Alaska,\u201d said Fiona Hill, who served as Trump\u2019s senior adviser on Russia at the National Security Council during his first term, including when he last met Putin in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "In an interview, Hill argued that Trump had emerged from the meeting in a weaker position on the world stage because of his reversal. Other leaders, she said, might now look at the U.S. president and think he\u2019s \u201cnot the big guy that he thinks he is and certainly not the dealmaking genius.\u201d",

      "Trump seemed to revel in particular in Putin echoing his oft-repeated assertion that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been in office instead of Democrat Joe Biden at the time.",
      "Before news cameras, Trump did not use the opportunity to castigate Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II or human rights abuses he's been accused of committing. Instead, Putin was the one who spoke first, and invited Trump to join him in Moscow next.",

      "It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\u201cThese impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\u201d said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \u201cOur enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\u201d",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cGold tends to be a stable asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThat actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That\u2019s why gold as an asset in investment.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",

      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\u201d said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It\u2019s the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\u201d",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold\u2019s mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur\u2019s environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\u201d The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that\u2019s been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\u201d Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That\u2019s 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\u201d",

      "Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel",
      "Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues.",
      "\u201cWhat are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?\u201d the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily.",
      "Amid growing public pressure, Sylvania Township asked county engineers in March to analyze whether Mitchaw Road's posted speed is too high. The surprising answer: Technically, it's 5 mph too low.",
      "The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. \u2014 even in urban areas.",
      "Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road\u2019s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment.",
      "But after decades of closely following the rule, some states \u2014 with a nudge from the federal government \u2014 are seeking to modify if not replace it when setting guidelines for how local engineers should decide what speed limit to post.",
      "The concept assumes that a road's safest speed is the one most vehicles travel \u2014 neither too high nor too low. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and \u201cvote with their feet,\u201d as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it.",
      "\u201cThe problem with this approach is it creates this feedback loop,\u201d said Jenny O'Connell, director of member programs for the National Association of City Transportation Officials. \u201cPeople speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.\u201d",
      "The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as \u201cCity Limits,\u201d which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions.",
      "The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that \u201cthese historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.\u201d",
      "Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes.",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Others, however, are still clinging to the simplicity and familiarity of the longstanding approach, she said.",
      "\u201cThe 85th percentile should not be the Holy Grail or the Bible, and yet over and over again it is accepted as that,\u201d Shahum said.",
      "Under its \u201c20 is Plenty\u201d campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets.",
      "When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network.",
      "California embraces the 85% rule even more than most states as its basis for setting speed limits. But legislators have loosened the restrictions on local governments a bit in recent years, allowing them to depart from the guidelines if they can cite a proven safety need. Advocates for pedestrians and bicyclists say the change helps, but is not enough.",

      "\u201cWe still have a long way to go in California in terms of putting value on all road users,\u201d said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s still a very heavy mindset that automobiles are the primary method of travel and they should be given priority and reverence.\u201d",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really matter what number you put on a sign,\u201d Beeber said. \u201cThe average driver drives the nature of the roadway. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.\u201d",
      "Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Since then, speed limits have kept climbing, with North Dakota this summer becoming the ninth state to allow drivers to go 80 mph on some stretches of highway. There's even a 40-mile segment in Texas between Austin and San Antonio where 85 mph is allowed.",
      "Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety \u2014 a research arm funded by auto insurers \u2014 illustrates the risks. Every 5 mph increase to a state's maximum speed limit increases the chance of fatalities by 8.5% on interstate highways and 2.8% on other roads, the study found.",
      "\u201cMaybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. You're in a cocoon,\u201d said Chuck Farmer, the institute's vice president for research, who conducted the study.",
      "If elected officials in Sylvania Township, Ohio, got their way, Mitchaw Road's posted speed limit would be cut dramatically \u2014 from 55 mph to 40 mph or lower. The county's finding that the 85% rule actually calls for raising it to 60 mph surprised the town's leaders, but not the engineers who ran the study.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t make decisions based on data, it\u2019s very difficult to make good decisions,\u201d Lucas County Engineer Mike Pniewski said.",
      "For now, the speed limit will remain as it is. That's because Ohio law sets maximum speeds for 15 different types of roadways, regardless of what the 85% rule suggests.",
      "And Ohio's guidelines are evolving. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. Authorities there recently hired a consultant to consider additional modifications based on what other states are doing.",
      "\u201cStates have very slowly started to move away from the 85th percentile as being kind of the gold standard for decision-making,\u201d said Michelle May, who manages Ohio's highway safety program. \u201cPeople are traveling and living differently than they did 40 years ago, and we want to put safety more at the focus.\u201d",
      "It's unclear whether any of these changes will ultimately impact the posted speed on Mitchaw Road. After years of futile calls and emails to state, county and township officials, Hammond says she isn't holding her breath.",
      "\u201cI just get so discouraged,\u201d she said.",

By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil \u2014 America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre \u2014 the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.",
      "Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "\"HIGH STAKES!!!\" Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.",
      "On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia\u2019s Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.",
      "Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before \u2014 but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling.",
      "Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting \u2014 a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.",
      "When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia \u201cnever plans ahead.\u201d",
      "\"We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,\u201d he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin\u2019s longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities.",
      "The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.",
      "In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as \u201c really a feel-out meeting.\u201d But he's also warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to mess around with me.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The much-anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin began with a warm welcome and a flyover by screaming jets at a U.S. military base in Alaska but ended with a thud Friday after they conceded that they had failed to reach any agreements on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference \u2014 but they took no questions.",
      "\u201cWe had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to, there are just a very few that are left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\u201d",
      "Putin, welcomed into the U.S. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the summit:",
      "Putin got a red carpet welcome and even rode in Trump\u2019s presidential limousine from the tarmac to the summit venue. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin.",
      "Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II.",
      "He said the U.S. and Russia share values, a standard talking point for Russian officials when trying to woo Trump and his aides. Putin also noted that Trump has frequently said the Ukraine war wouldn\u2019t have happened had he won the 2020 election.",
      "\"I think that would have been the case,\" the Russian leader said, a comment sure to please Trump.",
      "However, there is no indication and no way to prove that Moscow would have acted differently toward Ukraine had Democrat Joe Biden not been elected.",
      "Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine \u2014 or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one.",
      "Instead, Trump conceded that \u201cwe haven\u2019t quite got there\u201d and said he would be conferring with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders about next steps.",

    "story": [
      "In California\u2019s Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest places on Earth, summer temperatures can soar into the 130s F",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- Ray Estrada's 11-year-old grandson is used to Las Vegas' scorching summers, but he'd always wanted to experience the heat in one of the Earth's hottest places. So Estrada recently drove him to Death Valley National Park, with an umbrella, extra water and electrolytes in tow. That day, the thermometer soared to 118 F (47.78 C).",
      "\u201cWe have to be very careful when we go out there,\u201d Estrada told him. \u201cIf you start feeling dizzy or whatever... we\u2019re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.\u201d",
      "The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service.",
      "But that's easier said than done.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to underestimate how dangerous heat is,\" said Abby Wines, the park's acting deputy superintendent. \u201cPeople are usually used to thinking of heat as something that makes them uncomfortable,\" and that they can tough it out.",
      "\u201cThis type of heat will kill,\u201d she said.",
      "Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded \u2014 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 \u2014 although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021.",
      "In the U.S., heat kills more people than other weather events combined, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which come from burning fuels like oil and coal, continue at their current pace, more places could experience broiling temperatures. That makes it crucial to communicate the dangers of extreme heat and safety precautions, as both can influence who lives and dies.",
      "Throughout this desert are stark warnings of the deadly heat: \u201cStop. Extreme heat danger. Walking after 10 a.m. not recommended,\u201d one sign says. \u201cHEAT KILLS!\u201d warns another. On bathroom walls there are reminders to hydrate in the form of charts displaying the color of pee \u2014 the darker the urine, the more you need to drink water.",
      "Another sign warns visitors that helicopters for medical emergencies can\u2019t safely fly amid extreme temperatures. Ambulances can often deploy in extreme heat but are not a guarantee. The safety of emergency responders is always considered.",
      "Baruch Fischhoff, professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies decision-making, said evidence shows that people generally underestimate risk when they have a sense of control. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it\u2019s too hot \u201ctakes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.\u201d",
      "Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. Last summer, a helicopter was unable to fly to a rescue because of 128 F (53.33 C) temperatures. A group of visitors were traveling on motorcycles when one died from the heat, and another was treated for severe heat illness and transported to a hospital.",
      "Rescue options are even more limited for hikers lost on a trail. Unless it\u2019s a short distance and rescuers know where the person is, they\u2019ll likely wait until sunset if it\u2019s above 115 F (46.11 C). \u201cDepending on their situation,\u201d Wines said, that's \u201cprobably too late.\u201d",
      "Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). But it's the moderate temperatures that tend to get people into more trouble.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a harder time communicating our concerns about heat to the public when they visit and it\u2019s only 100 to 115,\" Wines said. The dryness evaporates sweat almost instantly, so many people don't realize how much they're actually sweating.",
      "Then there's the vastness. Death Valley has more than 50 entrances, so many visitors aren't seeing rangers who can relay important information. Instead, they place heat warning signs in the hottest and most popular spots. But they discovered that people responded less to heat warning signs that looked permanent compared to those that seemed temporary.",

      "For Marc Green, an expert in experimental psychology, that finding is \u201c100% predictable.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople judge what to do based on specific information,\u201d he said. If a warning sign is up all the time, even when conditions are good, it contains no useful information. \u201cThat's why people disregard it.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. How people perceive heat and other climate risks varies by factors like age, race, gender, income level and where they live. Older white men, for instance, tend to have lower risk perceptions across the board, whereas women have higher risk perceptions than men.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, though, is that the level of worry or risk perception doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into action,\u201d Marlon said. Optimism bias could also falsely make a person believe the heat won\u2019t personally affect them. While studies show that experience with heat increases people\u2019s concern, it is short-lived.",
      "\u201cYou get a bump for like a year or so after a really big event and then it just goes right back to the baseline,\u201d she said.",
      "Marlon said to be specific. Don't just tell people that heat can be lethal, tell them what could happen to their bodies and what to do to stay safe.",
      "Death Valley park does this. On site and online, park officials tell visitors to avoid hiking at low elevations after 10 a.m., to stay on paved roads and near their cars. They say to drink and carry plenty of water, and to seek shade and hydrate if you feel dizzy, nauseous or have a headache.",
      "And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people\u2019s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said.",
      "The messenger is also important. If friends, family and neighbors are worried and nudging you to do something, that can be more powerful than reading information online. Community leaders modeling appropriate behavior \u2014 like saying they\u2019re evacuating their family ahead of a hurricane or that they carry extra water in their trunk \u2014 can also go a long way.",
      "Marlon also suggested communicating how extreme heat can impair the ability to think clearly. When communicating with images, show people drinking water, putting on cold wet towels or resting in shade.",
      "\u201cWhatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we\u2019re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,\u201d Marlon said.",

      "The 600-pound (273-kilogram) bronze statue used to greet visitors at the Grand Canyon Lodge on the national park's North Rim. The nearly century-old building was reduce to rubble this summer when a wildfire swept through the area. Brighty was found charred, his head and body mostly intact.",
      "As firefighters continued their work Friday to corral the stubborn flames, Brighty hit the road \u2014 strapped into the back of a pickup truck for a roughly five-hour journey that would take him from his home on the North Rim to the South Rim.",
      "The plan calls for temporarily housing him in the Grand Canyon National Park's museum collection so he can be assessed. It will be up to park officials and conservation experts to determine if the burro can be carefully restored or if a new statue will have to be created.",
      "There's no timeline for the effort, but fans on social media already are weighing in with support for returning the burro to his former glory. They talk about taking family pictures with the sculpture in the background and reading the children's book that's loosely based on the original burro's adventures traversing the canyon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very special symbolic piece of history for a lot of people,\u201d park spokesperson Jo\u00eblle Baird told The Associated Press.",
      "An enduring symbol of life along the rugged canyon, the hefty statue represents a free-spirited burro who lived more than a century ago. Brighty was known to migrate up and down the canyon as the seasons changed. He'd help haul water to a summer camp on the North Rim in exchange for pancakes and would give children rides.",

      "Brighty is a small but important part of what will be a yearslong effort for the National Park Service as it charts a path for restoration and reconstruction on the North Rim.

      "The U.S. plans to build a $750 million factory in southern Texas to breed billions of sterile flies, ramping up its efforts to keep flesh-eating maggots in Mexico from crossing the border and damaging the American cattle industry.",
      "Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture hopes to be producing and releasing sterile male New World screwworm flies into the wild within a year from the new factory on Moore Air Base outside Edinburg, Texas, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the border. She also said the USDA plans to deploy $100 million in technology, such as fly traps and lures, and step up border patrols by \u201ctick riders\u201d mounted on horseback and train dogs to sniff out the parasite.",
      "In addition, Rollins said the U.S. border will remain closed to cattle, horse and bison imports from Mexico until the U.S. sees that the pest is being pushed back south toward Panama, where the fly had been contained through late last year through the breeding of sterile flies there. The U.S. has closed its border to those imports three times in the past eight months, the last in July, following a report of an infestation about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border.",
      "American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause billions of dollars in economic losses and cause already record retail beef prices to rise even more, fueling greater inflation. The parasite also can infest wildlife, household pets and, occasionally, humans.",
      "\u201cFarm security is national security,\u201d Rollins said during a news conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \u201cAll Americans should be concerned. But it\u2019s certainly Texas and our border and livestock producing states that are on the front lines of this every day.\u201d",
      "The pest was a problem for the American cattle industry for decades until the U.S. largely eradicated it in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females. It shut down fly factories on U.S. soil afterward.",
      "The Mexican cattle industry has been hit hard by infestations and the U.S. closing its border to imports.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Agriculture ministry said in a statement Friday that Mexico Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 Sacrist\u00e1n and Rollins signed a screwworm control action plan. It includes monitoring with fly-attracting traps and establishing that livestock can only be moved within Mexico through government-certified corrals, the statement said.",

The sterile males are released in large enough numbers that wild females can't help but mate with them, producing sterile eggs that don't hatch. Eventually, the wild fly population shrinks away because females mate only once in their weekslong lives.",
      "In June, Rollins announced a plan to convert an existing factory for breeding fruit flies into one for breeding sterile New World Screwworm flies, as well as a plan to build a site, also on the air base near Edinburg, for gathering flies imported from Panama and releasing them from small aircraft. Those projects are expected to cost a total of $29.5 million.",

      "Cantrell and Vappie used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to harass a citizen, delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, \u201cand ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,\u201d Simpson said.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California is the first Democratic-led state to wade into a brewing national redistricting fight after President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to draw new maps to maintain the party's slim U.S. House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The Texas plan was temporarily stalled when minority Democrats left the state to stop the Legislature from passing any bills, but some lawmakers said they'll return to Texas now that California is moving forward with its counter act.",
      "Both parties hope to add five seats for their side.",
      "Here's what happens next in California:",
      "Lawmakers will return to the Capitol on Monday after summer break and plan to immediately take up the partisan plan. State Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 enough to act without any Republican votes \u2014 and Newsom has said he\u2019s not worried about winning the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers to advance the maps.",
      "Lawmakers will hold hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday on a package of bills to establish the new congressional map, declare a Nov. 4 special election and authorize to reimburse local government for the costs. Elections committees in both houses are asking for public feedback on the proposed map, but it's unlikely any changes would be made after the bills are officially introduced Monday.",
      "Amendments to any legislation would require a 72-hour wait before a vote. That would jeopardize Democrats' plan to approve the package by Thursday to give elections officials enough time to prepare ballots for a statewide election in November. State leaders already have blown past deadlines designed to give local officials adequate time for organizing an election.",
      "California sends every voter a mail-in ballot roughly a month before each election. That means local officials have less than two months to prepare and print ballots.",
      "They're already preparing. On Friday, a coalition of county officials urged the Legislature to provide money in advance, because many counties are cash-strapped, and officials worry they won't have enough money to administer the election.",
      "A 2021 special election cost over $200 million to conduct. State Republicans this week estimated this year's would cost $235 million.",
      "Democrats chose Nov. 4 for the election because Los Angeles County and others are already holding local elections that day.",

      "Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., who spent tens of millions to support the California ballot initiative that gives redistricting power to an independent commission, also plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d nonpartisan redistricting, his spokesperson said.",
      "State Republicans say the move is a power grab by Democrats and some have vowed to go to court.",
      "Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for governor, earlier this month paid for a legal opinion that says redistricting outside of the normal process and cycle violates the California Constitution. The new map wouldn\u2019t be fair because state lawmakers are relying on outdated population data, he said.",
      "Common Cause, a good governance group that supports independent redistricting, initially opposed California's effort but this week reversed its stance. The group said it won't challenge partisan redistricting in California if the effort is approved by voters, among other criteria.",
      "California voters in 2010 gave the power to draw congressional maps to an independent commission, with the goal of making the process less partisan. The commission last redrew maps following the 2020 census, and the maps were in place for the 2022 and 2024 U.S. House elections.",
      "Newsom and Democratic leaders say they'll ask voters to approve their new maps only for the next few elections. They say they'll return map-drawing power to the commission following the 2030 census.",
      "The new map would take effect only if a Republican state moves forward with new maps.",

      "The Department of Corrections' critical incident review of Grant Hardin's May 25 escape from the Calico Rock prison provides the most detailed description so far of his planning and the issues that allowed him to walk out of the facility.",

      "Hardin, who worked in the prison's kitchen, said he spent six months planning his escape and used black Sharpie markers and laundry he found lying around the kitchen to create the fake uniform, according to the report. Hardin fashioned a fake badge using the lid of a can.",

      "Two prison employees have been fired for procedure violations that led to Hardin's escape. They include a kitchen employee who allowed Hardin on a back dock unsupervised and a tower guard who unlocked the back gate that Hardin walked through without confirming his identity. Several other employees have been suspended and one demoted, lawmakers were told this week.",
      "The kitchen's staff was \u201cvery lax on security,\u201d Hardin told investigators, allowing him to gather what he needed for his escape. Hardin said he didn't have any help from staff or other inmates. Hardin had constructed a ladder from wooden pallets in case he needed to scale the prison fence but didn't need it.",
      "\u201c(Hardin) stated when he walked up to the gate, he just directed the officer to \u2018open the gate,\u2019 and he did,\u201d the report says.",

      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:45:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",
      "More than a dozen NHL teams, both\u00a0north\u00a0and\u00a0south\u00a0of the Canadian border, followed with posts on social media acknowledging Swift's new album.",
      "mb12 pic.twitter.com/HUz2MYpEMc",

      "Google is using its search engine to celebrate the October release of Swift's \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Users who search for \"Taylor Swift,\" are greeted with a shower of orange digital confetti, along with a flaming orange heart and the phrase, \"And, baby, that's show business for you.\"",
      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "\"This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,\" Swift said.",
      "Here are more details Swift shared about the upcoming album:",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",
      "Asked by Jason Kelce why she chose orange for the color scheme of the album, Swift said, \"I've just always liked it, Jason.\"",
      "\"It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt, and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" she said.",
      "There are 12 songs on the album",
      "Swift shared the titles of the 12 tracks on the album: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\" \"Ruin The Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"Cancelled!,\" \"Honey\" and \"The Life of a Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter).\"",
      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",

      "The cover of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is a layered picture of Swift submerged in water.",

      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",
      "The images were captured by photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who Swift previously worked with for the album art for her sixth studio album, \"reputation,\" released in 2017.",
      "\"I loved what they did with those photos, so I called them up for this one, and I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one,\" she said.",
      "The album was recorded in Sweden during the Eras Tour",
      "Swift traveled to Sweden on her off days while touring Europe during the Eras Tour to work on the album.",
      "\"I would be playing shows, I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have like three days off, I'd fly to Sweden,\" she said. \"I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance\"",
      "Some additional details about \"The Life of a Showgirl\" came from Travis Kelce, who revealed he has heard the whole album.",
      "\"I know they're all 12 bangers,\" he said. \"It's a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more like fun pop like excitement. \u2026 I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on 'Tortured Poets' for sure.\"",
      "Swift confirmed that was a good way to describe the album, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\"",

      "\"This podcast did a lot for me,\" Swift said. \"It gave me a boyfriend!\"",
      "Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2023. At the time, Kelce shared on the podcast, he tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number; however, she never received it.",
      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!' And I was heaving crying. This changed my life.\"",

      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",

      "Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Swift put out the word on her website\u00a0shortly after a countdown timer expired at 12:12 a.m. Tuesday. On Wednesday, her site shared that it will be available Oct. 3.",
      "Fans have long theorized that Swift's 12th album would be released soon.",
      "On Monday, Taylor Nation \u2014 an official branch of the pop superstar's marketing team \u2014 posted a TikTok slideshow of 12 images with the caption \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era...'\" Swift is seen wearing orange in every image.",
      "A special limited vinyl edition of the album will be released in \"portofino orange glitter,\" according to a preorder page on her site. The vinyl version of the album is available for preorder on the site for $29.99. The cassette version is going for $19.99 and a CD with a poster of Swift is priced at $12.99.",
      "Sensing a pattern, eagle-eyed fans noticed that 12 minutes before the Taylor Nation post, the popular \"New Heights\" podcast posted a tease\u00a0for Wednesday. The show, hosted by Swift's boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce alongside his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, posted an orange image on social media with a mysterious silhouette, many believing to be Swift.",
      "Swift also announced early Tuesday that she would appear on the podcast, and a teaser video posted about her appearance showed her pulling the album from a briefcase. The actual album artwork, just as it is on her website, was blurred ahead of its reveal on Wednesday.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" follows last year's \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" announced during the 2024 Grammys and released during her record-breaking tour, which raked in more than $2.2 billion across two years and five continents, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. She's taken home 14 Grammys, including an unheard-of four for album of the year.",
      "The album is also her first release since Swift regained control over her entire body of work. In May, she said she purchased her catalog of recordings \u2014 originally released through Big Machine Records \u2014 from their most recent owner, the private equity firm Shamrock Capital. She didn't disclose the purchase price.",
      "In recent years, Swift has been rerecording and releasing her first six albums in an attempt to regain control of her music. The project was instigated by Hybe America CEO Scooter Braun's purchase and sale of her early catalog and represents Swift's effort to control her own songs and how they're used.",
      "Previous \"Taylor's Version\" releases have been more than conventional rerecordings, arriving with new \"from the vault\" music, Easter eggs and visuals that deepen understanding of her work.",
      "So far, there have been four rerecorded albums, beginning with \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" in 2021. All four have been massive commercial and cultural successes, with each debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

      "\"I was running to the grave. I had a death wish and I was so dark and suicidal,\" Mescudi said of the start of his career, when he was around 25 years old.

      "\"I had a lot of people that supported me, but there were a few that were -- had some opinions about it,\" he said. \"It was interesting because I'm not no street dude. I don't live by no code, you know? So I guess it's because I'm a rapper. People just threw that on me. But, like, my music has never been about that and I have never tried to pretend I was about that.\"",

      "He described their fallout as \"really heartbreaking\" and says it's a \"sad thing\" that their partnership is over.",
      "\"I think he has [broken my heart] over and over multiple times,\" Mescudi said. \"Just the code of friendship. He's said some things that there's just no coming back from.\"",

      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Lakota People's Law Project\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Hills Clean Water Alliance have also voiced opposition to the proposed drilling and mining for gold in the area, KELO-TV reported.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

    "summary": "A new report from Deloitte shows the average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, up nearly 3% from 2024. But that all depends on what you buy.",
    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",
      "While the cost of American cheese is up 0.7% from July 2024, according to BLS data, it is down 2.6% from last month.",
      "Iceberg lettuce is 3.9% lower in cost than it was a year ago, according to July CPI data, while the price of romaine lettuce is 4.6% higher.",
      "Tomato prices are also down. The fruit commonly consumed as a vegetable cost 7.8% less per pound in July than it did a year ago.",
      "The overall higher sticker prices at supermarkets has been a major pressure point for Americans, half of whom say the cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress\u00a0in their life right now, according to a poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

    "story": [
      "As recently as 2021, almost half of all U.S. mansions \u2014 homes with at least 5,000 square feet of livable space \u2014 cost $1 million or less. But today, only a handful of cities still offer top-end homes at that price range, according to a new Zillow\u00a0analysis of home prices across the U.S.",
      "Nationwide, mansions are selling for a median price of $1.4 million, but in some parts of the country, high-end properties fetch far more. In four major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median mansion has a price tag of $4.5 million, Zillow said.",
      "In four metro areas, though, homebuyers can snap up an extra-large residence for under $1 million:",

      "For those willing to trade location for space, mansion values also hover around or slightly more than $1 million across the Midwest and in some Southern cities as well, including Louisville, Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama, according to Zillow.",
      "\"In general, mansion prices move with general affordability. So in places like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis, in the broad scheme of the U.S., these markets tend to be relatively more affordable,\" Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it makes sense you could find a typical mansion for under $1 million in those regions.\"",
      "Many mansions that below the $1 million mark are less expensive because they are older homes, with a median construction year of 1985 versus 2000 for the median construction year for all mansions, Zillow said.",
      "In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were worth less than $1 million. Today, just three in 10 fall below the $1 million threshold, according to the report.",
      "Mansions \u2014 and homes in general \u2014 are most costly on the coasts. In San Jose, the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million, for example. \"The coasts tend to be on the pricier side, and that follows general affordability trends,\" Ng said. \"It's hard to build due to geographical constraints, and housing deficits in these areas tends to put upward pressure on prices.\"",
      "To be sure, homebuyers in every price range are getting less for their money, with the median U.S. home sale price reaching\u00a0a record of nearly $400,000 in June, according to Redfin. Tight inventory and high mortgage rates has made it tougher for would-be buyers to enter the property market.",
      "Last year, just 24% of home sales were to first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Where are the most mansions under $1 million?",
      "Atlanta, Georgia has the greatest number of mansions \u2014 21,634 \u2014 under $1 million. That accounts for 5% of all mansions under $1 million in the U.S. Look to New York City for the second highest share of large residences \u2014 2,555, \u2014 under $1 million.",

      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",
      "What does the PPI mean for the Fed?",
      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",
      "The PPI data \"suggests inflation isn't the non-story some people thought it was after Tuesday's CPI print,\" Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley's E*TRADE, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As far as the likelihood of a rate cut goes, the data \"doesn't slam the door on a September rate cut, but based on the market's initial reaction, the opening may be a little smaller than it was a couple of days ago,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The Social Security Administration makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year to ensure benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. The yearly adjustment, which the agency is scheduled to announce in October, would go into effect in January 2026.",
      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

We sincerely accept that our preparations had not been adequate,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",

      "The U.S. stock market is rallying toward records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",

It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, and it topped forecasts.",
      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",
      "Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That's putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world's second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",

      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",

      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",

With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE.

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Former Attorney General William Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by Congress members as questions surrounding his role in the Epstein investigation persist.",
    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

    "summary": "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff says Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called them \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats fled to blue states earlier this month after President Trump suggested the state should redraw its U.S. House district maps to secure more Republican seats. The Democrats have until now remained out of the state to deny Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.",
      "The GOP-led redistricting effort would create five more Republican-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans currently have a narrow majority in the House. Historically, the party that controls the White House typically loses ground in midterm elections. States usually redraw districts each decade to reflect population shifts after the decennial census.",
      "After successfully denying Texas Republicans a quorum multiple times in recent weeks, Democrats notched a small victory when the GOP wrapped the initial special session. With a new special session gaveled in on Friday, the Democrats have begun returning. Some are already in Texas, and the caucus is working on a count to tell whether the chamber will have a quorum Monday, the sources told CBS News.",

      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this.

      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they \u2013 as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.",
      "But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours.",
      "World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week.",
      "Good morning.",
      "JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main \u2013 one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And \u2013 and that's how \u2013 what I have to report with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",
      "So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.",
      "I can say that where we are, obviously people are \u2013 are \u2013 are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.",
      "But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good to see you in person. Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee. The Secretary of State just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they've been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas, or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza. The United States screens all visas. So, is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REP. JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And, you know, the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the Secretary of State.",
      "REP. CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, on Ukraine: You know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REP. CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will. But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it. Right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it. In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance. Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego- we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out. He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts. And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here, and they haven't pulled back. They need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions. But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REP. CROW: There's no doubt. As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that, on a bipartisan basis, pushed really hard in the first two years of this war, under the Biden administration, to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win. And I do believe that had we done more, and we had done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today. But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like look at what happened on Friday. U.S. military personnel in uniform, literally, were on their hands and knees, rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century. Somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Somebody who started this whole war, right? This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate. Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state. This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform. I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article Five-like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REP. CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go. But, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee. I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military. But we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that put pressure on Vladimir Putin. And actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine. There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets, and the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money. Allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last administration was too, they--",
      "REP. CROW: --That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation. But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see, and how does that compare to the last visit?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district, in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years. And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does. Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE. Made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States. Bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined. And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they were trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll see where that heads next. Jason Crow, thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, founder of World Central Kitchen, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation-related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children, seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours. World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week. Good morning. It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report, but they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOS\u00c9 ANDR\u00c9S: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset, and I visit our main- one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Deir al-Balah. And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens, and spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread that we are producing right now. So this was a day, again, to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And that's what I have to report about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza, Israel's Prime Minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, there is always a gray area, but we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very- a special need situation. I saw those boxes being made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks, no food was going inside Gaza, and this is two- two million people. So in the places we know we are feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's what we are trying to increase. I can say that where we are, obviously, people are- are being fed at the bare minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they're receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food. But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza- and this is beyond food, obviously, medicines, etc., etc. We need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where- in some areas, like in the north, that is still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially. But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce one million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it's a million because we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food, but obviously we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are given more access, including us and other organizations like Anera, which was one of the organizations we work with that they've been in Gaza for many, many decades- and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that, we need a lot of things, the trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza, and there they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside so the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow. I have to report that, yes, I saw a good flow of trucks going in. I don't- around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I will say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase- that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure- like what World Central Kitchen does, at one moment we had, you know, 100, 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are, so the people don't have to be, again, leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring little bit of food back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of walking to designated areas for food, you're referring to the model that the Israelis have set up with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. You are saying that their preferred method of feeding people is not sufficient.",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it takes a village, right? To feed 2 million people and more in a- in a situation like the people of Gaza are facing. That's why the model we are- we are pushing for is the more kitchens we have, the better. Right now, we have 80 partner kitchens on top of the two main World Central Kitchen kitchens, but that's not enough. We need to make sure that we increase the numbers of World Central Kitchen, the big ones that people can see on the webpage of World Central Kitchen or in my Twitter account. We need to make sure that our partner kitchens, that they produce between 500 and two, three, four thousand meals each. We need to make sure the bakeries are fully loaded with bread. We need to make sure that we have the fuel. That's why we need to be bringing pellets, because we have hundreds of kitchens firing up every day. We need the fuel to be able to cook the food. The big bakery we have, a bakery that was in partnership with the Kingdom of Jordan that is doing almost 50,000 loaves of bread a day. We need diesel to make sure that we are able to move the machinery to be very effective, but that's only one bakery doing 50,000 pitas a day. We need many more bakeries to make sure that we are able to- to cover the demand of 2 million people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I have to ask you about an incident that happened a few days ago. World Central Kitchen issued a statement saying the Israeli government told you armed people were posing as workers for your organization. Is that the first time that you've heard bad actors are trying to pose as humanitarian workers? Have you experienced exploitation by Hamas?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, World Central Kitchen, we are a young organization. Gaza is a very complicated place. I know this is still kind of under investigation on our side and everybody else. But doubly, we are there to be next to the people of Gaza, next to the Palestinians. At the end, what we have is Palestinians feeding Palestinians. Only in our kitchens, we have around 600 Palestinians doing amazing work just trying to feed their fellow citizens, and that's what we plan to continue to make sure that Palestinians feed Palestinians, that Palestinians take care of themselves, and we're going to be giving them all the support we can to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you met with a former hostage while you were in- in Israel, whose brother is still being held in Gaza. What did you learn?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Yeah, I've been- I've been- I've been- I've been meeting with- with different- but these- I met with Iair Horn. His brother is still in Gaza. You know, we had a two hour conversation. You know, was hard to listen to the story. Obviously, he wants his brother- his brother out. Today is a very massive strike in- in Israel, and everybody is asking for the return of the hostages. That's what should be happening. That's what should be- let's hope that this happens, obviously, alongside of a cease-fire, of peace, where nobody is under bombs, where nobody has their loved ones away, where nobody is losing their loved ones in the middle of- of- of this- of this war, where everybody is fed, where we can start the reconstruction of Gaza, where every children can receive a plate of food that they can go back to school, where, obviously, the hostages are released, where the people of Palestine and Gaza can live in peace and where the people of Israel can live in peace. What is good for you must be good for me. Let's hope that you at least will cover the basic minimums right now of feeding everybody, hopefully also the hostages being released as soon as possible.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Fiona Hill served as the Senior Director for Russia and European Affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine. Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoken about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared?",
      "HILL: Well, obviously quite different in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean, these are usually part of the sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement, or a set of announcements- presentations by both leaders. Much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So there wasn't that free-for-all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there, at Alaska. But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman crow has laid out for the United States and for President Trump, again, I mean, again, different, but although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a US Air Force base with the fight passing of the B-52s and other fighter jets, it did certainly look much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so, the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin had set the agenda there, the narrative and, in many respects, the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the President has a team of advisers around him, and in a traditional administration, those advisers would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that. Do you think that the President's team set him up for success here?",
      "HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry, that basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio, or to anybody else, that basically they wanted to have a major US-Russia, bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's to give them- them all the benefit of the doubt there. But, it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough. But he did say that there was something that might be possible. I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not. And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here, because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal, and he's not showing, right now, any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's Defense Secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the Secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think- what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "HILL: Well, look, I think he actually laid this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow made it very clear as well. It has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow that it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But, it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine. The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment, and the information and the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now, in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done, and what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States, to work with Europeans, and to work with Ukraine to make this happen. Look, this is existential, also for European security. So, minimizing the real role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin, and of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the FOX interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail-in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin, and during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been President. I mean, that's a counterfactual, but that something Trump often says on the- on the trail, why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies, because Putin deliberately asked him about this. So Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgement of his self-assertion that the war wouldn't have happened had he not- had he been in the presidency. And so, Putin is giving him something that plays well for President Trump in his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment, where people know things are much more complicated, but it's basically a gift and a concession to President Trump himself. And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's led into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there are no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail-in voting, and if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure, blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and that those elections are rigged in Russia. Correct?",
      "HILL: Of course. And I mean, basically, Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sow chaos, and he's just basically used his time with President Trump to push that along. It's, again, it's a diversion, it's a distraction, really, from the negotiations on Ukraine, because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up, so he gives up, basically, something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail-in voting point that he made.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator.",
      "SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us in your home state.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Welcome to Alaska. The father of the U.S. Air Force called Alaska the most strategic place in the world. That's a quote by Billy Mitchell that I use a lot. And now you see why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2014 very strategic. And I want to talk to you about a lot of things specific to the state--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014but this is the focus of the world right now\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014because of who's coming here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your perspective, you're a supporter of Ukraine\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014what does a successful Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, summit look like?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think the President and his team need to be commended. You know, they have put a lot of effort and energy in peace, with regard to Ukraine and Russia, like they're doing all around the world, you know, they're they're making a lot of headway on peace, whether it's the Azerbaijan-Armenia issues, Iran-Israel, Pakistan-India, they're putting a lot of energy into bringing peace to different parts of the world, but they put the most energy into this.",
      "So, look, I think a successful outcome would be, as you know, a com- negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult. Even this kind of high level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team. The different elements of a peace agreement, starting with the ceasefire, then you would have territorial issues, concessions or not, then you have security guarantees. But I think this is a place-setting exercise that the administration believes that if they can get a ceasefire, then you would do the other elements that I talked about, the much more complex elements, with Zelenskyy, with our European and NATO allies. So I think the President is going to assess Putin's seriousness on a ceasefire. And if he assesses that, that he's serious, and Putin agrees to a ceasefire, then I think that would be success. Then you move on to the other elements for round two. So this is really preliminary, and I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, watch for the ceasefire, and judge success based off of that. Well, the Kremlin has announced there's going to be this joint press conference. The White House says, we'll see, the president said maybe, maybe not. Vladimir Putin is being brought in from the cold. He's been isolated by the world for a reason. Do you think that this is rewarding bad behavior, by giving him this spotlight on the American soil?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, two things on that. Vladimir Putin is coming to negotiate with Trump because of the sanctions. I mean, don't take it from me. Listen to our European allies who are definitive on that. The reason Putin is even doing this is because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions. So I think that that is important. And, you know, in terms of American soil, look, I actually think Alaska is the appropriate place. Putin understands one thing, as you know, Margaret, strength and power. And my state exudes strength and power with a huge military here. By the way, we're having a giant military exercise going on right now. I hope Vladimir Putin sees a lot of that military power in the next couple of days. Unleashing American energy, which the President is doing. That's the weapon that Putin fears probably more than anything, when we can compete with them.",
      "And then this is also, you know, a place that demonstrates a huge element of American power and strength, which is our allies. We have allies doing military exercises up here as we speak, the president has been doing a great job with our European allies. Gotten NATO to get to 5%, coordinating with them all week. So I think those are really important. And then finally, you know, as an Alaskan. I think it's important, from the perspective of reminding the Russians that we are quite good negotiators, including the president of the United States. You know, last time we had a big deal with Russia in America, about my state, we got this great state for two cents an acre, $7.2 million, probably the deal of the century. And I think the Russians- I think the Russians probably have to remember that too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly. Don't you think for Vladimir Putin, who, you know, allegedly wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire, that maybe has a little bit of a different meaning for him, arriving here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think he has no- I mean, who knows what they think about Alaska, but I know what Alaskans think about Russia. And you know, we're a strong state, like I said. We have enormous power right here. And so again, I think for all these reasons, this is going to be a really important summit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- he is an indicted war criminal, for a very specific crime of kidnapping Ukrainian children. He's bombed hospitals in Syria. He's massacred people, ordered them at least, he's- he's murdered many of his own people. He's used chemical weapons on British soil. That's why he's under this kind of pressure and U.S. sanctions. Really, are you pleased that he's this close to home?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, like I said, I mean the- the part about\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it normalizes that, that it forgives that, that it brings him back into the fold by giving him that photo op that makes him look so powerful?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You know, peace is difficult, right? We've had high level discussions with Reagan in Gorbachev, with Stalin, with Mao Zedong. I mean, this is what diplomacy is about, when you try to end wars. And it's- the way you end wars is, you discuss them with the leaders of these countries. Look, I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin. I don't trust anything he says. The key is, when I think what the president has done when you're dealing with a dictator, is show up with strength, and that's what the president's done. Putin is coming to the negotiating tables because he's threatened by these sanctions. The president is rebuilding our military, rebuilding our energy sector, which is critical, critical to my state, and very importantly, as I already mentioned, coordinating really closely with one of the greatest strengths we have, and that's our allies. We are an ally rich nation. Putin is ally poor, and that's a huge strength of ours.",
      "So all of these things, I think, you focus on the strength, get Putin to a ceasefire, and move forward with Ukraine, Zelenskyy, our European allies, in terms of the more complicated elements of a peace negotiation. But it starts with this. Starts with a ceasefire. And look, if President Trump assesses Putin is not being honest, you've seen, you know, a lot of frustration from the president recently saying, hey, I have these good discussions with Putin, then he's out bombing, you know, hospitals and nursing homes. If he assesses that he's not serious, then, as the president said, there'll be severe consequences. And I think that's the kind of pressure we need to keep on to try to get to what everybody wants, which is an end of this war.",
      "END PART ONE",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if there's no ceasefire Friday, the Republican leader in the Senate is going to put that sanctions bill to a vote finally?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I don't know what the Republican Leader John Thune is going to do I know I'm a--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you like him to?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: -- I'm an original cosponsor of that sanctions bill. I think what we've been doing right now, Lindsey Graham has been leading the charge, doing a great job, which is coordinating with the White House, but the President has already threatened sanctions against India. I think soon they should be threatening sanctions against China. They're a huge secondary buyer as well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even as those negotiations over trade deals are ongoing?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I mean, I- look, I think with regard to buying oil and propping up the Putin war machine, the answer is yes, but we are trying to coordinate, and I think we're doing a good job with Leader Thune and Lindsey Graham on that sanctions bill, which has over 80 cosponsors. And look, there might be a time when the White House needs that, there's as you know, ongoing litigation over the tariffs, and having Congress pass legislation with regard to the tariffs makes that much more stronger from a legal perspective. But I think continuing to coordinate with the White House and when and how to do that with our leadership at this moment is the right approach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President has also spoken about the opportunities that might exist from a business perspective with Russia. The Telegraph was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast in the Bering Strait. Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of American investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So I doubt that's on the table. And you know, I would not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if--",
      "SEN SULLIVAN: --I would not, I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: By the way, just on that point, though, a contrast, you might remember the last time I was on your show, we talked about the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to talk about this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours, shutting us down, right? I mean, that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. As I mentioned when I was on your show last year. You know, the- our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump and his administration is a complete",
      "180 on that, unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one. He literally issued an executive order on day one. So, you know, we're getting a lot of support from this administration, great support on our economy, jobs and resource development. It's a breath of fresh air relative to the Biden administration, and I think we're going to see continued focus on that from this White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been pushing the Trump administration to invest in a project here. The state has a lot of fossil fuels, a lot of natural resources. The project's from the North Slope of Alaska, and it would bring natural gas, perhaps even to Asia, to Japan.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump announced it as a joint venture, but the FT is reporting no Asian partners have made an equity investment or entered supply contracts. What's the reality check? Where is this particular project?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So this is the big Alaska LNG Project that we've been working on for many, many years. It is a hugely strategic project. We have more natural gas on the North Slope than probably anywhere in the whole world. We've been working on a pipeline and an LNG facility right around here to ship that out. Alaska was the first place to ship LNG anywhere. We started exporting LNG to Japan in the late 1960s.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So right now, the Trump administration, the president and his cabinet have been pushing this project in their trade negotiation agreements. We've gotten great support from them. There's not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not a done deal.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's not a done deal yet, because we are- on the private sector side, we're working on what's called the FEED work, the front-end engineering and design that's going to be done in a few months. And that's when we're going to go to these countries and go to the companies in Korea, in Japan, in Taiwan, all very interested, and say, hey, here are the off-take agreements we want you to sign. The President and his team have been working closely with the private sector on this, so we're making more progress on this, Margaret, than we've ever made before. This can be great for Alaskans. Great for our military here. But as you mentioned, this is great for our Asian allies, the Koreans, the Japanese, some of whom are still getting Russian oil and gas. The Taiwanese are all very interested. I've been over those- these countries a number of times to press this project. But we've made more project- we've made more progress on this project with the Trump administration than we ever have. So I'm very bullish on this. And by the way, this will be a game changer, hugely strategic for our allies, for our military, for Alaskans. Estimates of this would create about 20,000 jobs. This is a game-changer strategically, and I'm really appreciative the President spent so much time pressing this project, and we've made good progress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources. They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it. You called it a lie.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this. But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer-term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. We love that more than the Biden administration EPA or President Biden himself did. We love that part of our state. But we know we need jobs, we need natural resource development, so we can do both. And here's the thing I did call the president, President Biden, out for lying because the entire North Slope of Alaska, the Inupiat community across the board, was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska- which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was a outrage. President Trump has reversed all that. The One Big Beautiful Bill, when we talk about the energy component of that legislation, it's almost all unleashing Alaska. So we're excited right now and- but we have a great record of being able to do both, develop natural resources and protect the environment here, and that's what the people of Alaska want.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- so for activists, or for those concerned about the damage here, you say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, I say- well, a couple things. A, we have the highest standards on the environment in a place in the world. I used to be the Commissioner of Natural resources and Energy- in charge of that. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go- like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards when you can get it from America, from American workers with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly- and this is something I really try to emphasize- I emphasized it with Secretary Kennedy when he was in town here a couple of weeks ago. You know, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases- increasing. On the North Slope of Alaska, when we started developing our resources, where most of the resources are, you had Inupiat native populations that had very low life expectancies. In 25 years, they increased their life expectancy by almost 13, 14, 15 years more than any other place in the country during that period, because they got good jobs, because they got hospitals, because they got clinics, because they got flushing toilets and running water. So when we're talking about resource development, it's not just the economy and jobs, it's people living longer in my state, and that's as important as it gets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you a little bit more about national security, and then talk a little bit more local, if we could. So in this region, the Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective. The ice is melting--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: --Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --also tapping into the natural resources there. How does the United States gain an edge in dominating that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska. And look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. When I first got to the Senate, I remember holding up the Biden- or, I'm sorry, the Obama administration Arctic strategy with the Secretary of Defense slamming it down on the dais and saying, Mr. Secretary, this is a joke. We have a huge national interest in the Arctic that we need to protect. It's not some parochial issue for Alaska's senator. This is about national security up here. So it is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They were trying, I remember back then they were trying for more ice cutters- Icebreakers and all of that--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, it's finally start- well, it's finally starting to happen. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the President's Golden Dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand new US Army Airborne Division up here. So we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities. Just three days ago, we commissioned finally an Icebreaker in Juneau, Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw that.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: That's going to be home ported in Alaska. Can you imagine that, Margaret? Putting an Icebreaker where the ice is makes sense, but it's never happened until last Sunday. President Trump and his team have been a huge proponent of this. And again, in the 'One Big \u00a0Beautiful Bill,' one of the untold stories of that bill--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $9 billion in it for Icebreakers.",
      "SEN. SULIVAN: Well, 20- almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, by far. 16 Icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic, because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that, because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances, made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic. They had a joint Bomber Task Force.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --come here pretty darn close.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZ, as they as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flashpoint. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ- in our waters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --economic zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes, that's happening on a regular basis now. That's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders, that's for sure. So again, it's the reason we need to build up, not just our military forces, but our infrastructure. And the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' I got a provision in to start reopening the Adak Navy military base. It was out on the Aleutian island chain. We're going to get a strategic Arctic port built in Nome, Alaska- in western Alaska. So, we need the infrastructure to project power, and we are getting that from this administration- and the Congress. A lot of this is bipartisan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican Chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the US military than what has been provided by the White House in their budget.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Again, 150 billion in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, 25 billion for the Coast Guard, which is part of our military. But I want to- you know, I'm someone who is a strong advocate for a strong military, particularly up here. And we need to do more, and we certainly need to keep it above 3% of GDP and growing towards four or 5% of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now, but this One Big, Beautiful Bill, the budget reconciliation bill, does a lot for our military right now. On urgent needs. Ship building, as you and I have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons, ammo systems, the Golden Dome. There's a lot in this One Big, Beautiful Bill that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what that is? Have they actually briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee? I know you have your own proposal, but has the Pentagon told you what the Golden Dome is?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Absolutely. Alright. I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor, the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country. In terms of ballistic missiles, we have new threats. We have hypersonics, we have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense, not just the ground based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THADD and then including space based systems, both for tracking and intercepting, and you do that with the open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So I am very familiar with what the Golden Dome is doing, and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it. And by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that we are running out of time. But I do need to ask you, when you're talking about the big, One, Big, Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You smile every time you say that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Republican tax and spend bill that just passed, Alaska got a lot of special treatment\u2013",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Alaska did very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0And your colleague, Senator Lisa Murkowski, acknowledged that, she said the bill wasn't good enough for the rest of the nation. You said you had a dark night of the soul at one point.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yeah, I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You almost didn't vote for this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No, I had a dark night of soul because I had been working on a provision in that bill--",
      "MARGRET BRENNAN: The Medicaid costs paid for by the federal government--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: The Medicaid FMAP as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: And that had the support of the White House, support of all the Republicans, something I've been working on for almost 10 years. Alaska gets a very low match in terms of Medicaid, one of the lowest in the country, which I think makes no sense. So this changes the formula to help states like mine that have very high health care costs. So that was in the bill, and Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats literally challenged every single good provision in that bill dealing with Alaska. And I mean every provision. Schumer definitely made himself clear that he was the anti-Alaska senator in the Senate. Everything- we fought him. We beat him back on almost everything. They won. Chuck Schumer stripped out a Medicaid increase for Alaska. It was tough on me, because I've been working on that for a long time. We pivoted. We got the Rural Health Care Transformation fund and increased--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got exemptions for Alaska Natives for new Medicaid and SNAP or food stamps. Work requirements waived for indigenous people. Alaska gets a larger share of rural hospital funds. Why shouldn't people living in other states get those same considerations?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, we have unique challenges up here. Come on up to Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it was a tight vote.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's a\u2013 What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was a tight vote. Well, Alaska had a lot of leverage here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's called- It's called good legislating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the rest of the country? You acknowledge there are flaws?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I'm first and foremost the Senator for Alaska. But I care about the rest of the country too, which is why I focus a lot on energy, a lot on our national security, a lot on border security. I care a lot about the border security in the southern part of America. So you know, all senators do that. They take care of their own state. They legislate to help their constituents. My constituents have unique needs, but we also bring a lot to the table for our great country. Like I said, we're protecting the whole country in terms of missile defense right now, we have a huge military up here that we love, that is protecting our interests in the North Pacific, in the Arctic, and we are unleashing American energy, which, of course, helps Alaska but helps America. When Alaska is doing well on energy issues, on critical mineral issues, that helps my constituents but helps the country. And that's again, why I'm so appreciative of the President and his team on recognizing that. The Biden guys, all they wanted to do was shut us down, close off our state. That didn't help anybody. All that helped was the Russians and the Iranians and the Venezuelans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Margaret, great to be here, and welcome to Alaska again. We're glad you're here.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the ceasefire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement. Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, ultimately, yeah. But I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument, he's been making this for a long time, and it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into- it's just so long. But the bottom line is that all of- you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this: are they going to stop fighting or not? And what it's going to take to stop the fighting. And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded. And the Russian side, because they feel like they got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor. They just churn through it. So I think what the President deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half, you know, it's on the other side of the world. That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on. So tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war- stop wars or prevent them. And right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War Two. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold, and the UK estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years. Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine, and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, Ukraine with Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --Well, the President said he did come to some agreement--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions. Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader- a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war. Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's- we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened. But ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow, with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides. But there's a reason why this war has been going on for three and a half years, and that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's- it's- it's not been easy, but it's something the President's made a priority. Peace. And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But ultimately, if- if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is okay to seize land by force?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative precedent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Are you demanding withdrawal?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --precedent. Well, again, here's the- in order to have a deal here to end- to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just the facts--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --in any negotiation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --where Russian forces are now?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No, no, but, if- But this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept. And what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it, otherwise there won't be a peace deal. Okay. If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it. So in order for there to be a peace deal, this is just a fact, we may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get. Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table, in order to make this happen. That's- that's just the way it is. And I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality. Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have- to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security. That's not an unreasonable request. That's something needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact, and there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows? The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible, and that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you, you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were- not enough for Ukraine, if not we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right? But- but certainly, there are some things we notice changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But again, all these things have to be verifiable. We- it isn't real until it's real. I mean, you- one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider, another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a trade off in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side, yeah, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy. They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost- 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month, in July, in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay. Not saying any of this is admirable, I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition, in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's Prime Minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article Five and a collective security clause that would involve the United States. How does that work? Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, what we're going to be working on. That's why- that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisors, a bunch of them from the different European countries, or European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail. I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out once it- concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play. But, that-that is one of the-if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are, obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to\u2013none of us want to see this war in the future. They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Including the United States?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- How do you rebuild the country? Well, potentially, like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting. That's why they're all coming here tomorrow, and-and that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them, and even leading up to it throughout the week there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas, they are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like. And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Yea, well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids. I've seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on- in every forum possible, and those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example. Turkey over the last few months--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, nothing so far from the Russians --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --that's been a topic of discussion as well --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We- on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation. But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After three and a half years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better, and that's why the President is investing so much time in bringing this to an end. And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this. The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved because the President is the only leader in the world- if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it, but you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is make a deal, Russia's a very big power and they're not. You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back- that's not true. No but that's not, why, that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming- in fact --",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- watching the one with Vladimir Putin where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader. It was very different--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- No, but it wasn't Zelenskyy. We've had more meetings, we've had, we've had, we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy. So that, but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the UK over the following, the previous weekend --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And they said the President Trump was going to demand a ceasefire --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- The President's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday. No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow- this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the- Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The President invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease fire. The President went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with him. He said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes. He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one,so--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Because obviously something, things happen during that meeting, well, because obviously things,look our goal here is not to stage some production for the world to say, oh how dramatic he walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement to end this war. Okay? And obviously we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase. If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this. You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands, the President has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions. But if he did this now, the moment the President puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year and a half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen if it's doable. It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announced that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, first of all, it's not just kids, it's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them. Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it, and so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them. And by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it. There is evidence, it's been presented to us by numerous congressional offices, that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas. So we need to- we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously, and we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the- to the process of acquiring those visas. We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",

      "The move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after President Trump's executive order on Monday, federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops.",
      "Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen and Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",

      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",
      "The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",
      "\"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence,\" the White House official said Saturday.",
      "A protest against Mr. Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday afternoon before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said \"No fascist takeover of D.C.,\" and some in the crowd held signs that said \"No military occupation.\" Mr. Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
      "Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.",

      "On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an \"emergency police commissioner\" after the district's top lawyer sued to contest.

    "summary": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is signaling it will more heavily scrutinize applications filed by legal immigrants seeking American citizenship, in its latest effort to tighten access to U.S. immigration benefits.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency overseeing the country's legal immigration system, instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
      "Typically, legal immigrants with U.S. permanent residency, also known as a green card, can apply for naturalized American citizenship after a 3- or 5-year period, depending on their case. Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.",
      "For decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"",
      "But a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"",
      "The directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.",
      "The memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.",
      "Those factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.",
      "Lastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.",
      "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.",
      "\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship \u2014 it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"",
      "Doug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.",
      "\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.",

      "The Trump administration has reduced funding for climate research, dismissed federal scientists who worked on the National Climate Assessment, and removed past editions of the report from government websites. Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.",
      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is calling up the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement to address crime in the capital.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",
      "James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",
      "Climate scientists say warmer summers and drier winters, driven by our burning of fossil fuels, are accelerating the loss. Seven of the 10 worst years for glacier melt worldwide have happened since 2010, according to Climate Central.",
      "Or just ask Mauri Pelto where the ice used to be. \"Almost 50 feet above my head just a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "Glaciers are Earth's water towers, storing 70% of the freshwater supply, vital for drinking, farming, and the health of many ecosystems. As they melt, sea levels are rising, and coastal flooding is getting worse.",
      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

      "Hurricane Erin is likely to bring \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" across the U.S. East Coast this week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, restrengthened back into a Category 4 storm Sunday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 8 a.m. EDT Monday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. The storm's center was about 115 miles north-northeast of Grand Turk Island and about 890 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It was moving northwest at 13 mph.",
      "A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 130-156 mph and is considered a major storm, capable of causing catastrophic damage.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin is a large storm that's expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said. It is not expected to make landfall in the U.S.",
      "\"The core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States by the middle of the week,\" the hurricane center said Monday.",
      "The hurricane center said some additional strengthening is expected today and then Erin may begin to weaken tonight, though it will \"remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.\"",
      "Forecasters said Erin's hurricane-force winds \u2014 74 mph or higher \u2014 extend outward up to 80 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 230 miles.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, the hurricane center said. The Bahamas government issued a tropical storm watch for the central Bahamas. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "On the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials with the National Park Service\u00a0announced\u00a0that sites on the island of St. Croix would be closed starting late Friday afternoon until after the storm passes.",

      "\"I didn't plan to run for office again. But when I see what's going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown said in a video announcement. \"That's why I'm running for Senate, because even in these challenging times, I still believe if you stand up for workers, treat people with respect, and always fight for Ohio, you can actually make a difference.\"",
      "Brown, 72, lost his bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber last November against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno. Brown was the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and was one of the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election in which they took control of the Senate.",
      "Brown had historically appealed to ticket-splitters with his strong working-class brand in the state, which he had represented in the Senate since 2007. But President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points, making Brown's election a steep uphill climb. Moreno beat him by less than four points.",
      "In 2026, Brown is set to face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who was appointed to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated. The special election will determine who will serve the remainder of Vance's term, meaning the winner would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "Husted, 57, was appointed in January by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and previously served as DeWine's lieutenant governor.",
      "The Ohio race is expected to be a tough battle for Democrats, as the party seeks to retake the majority in the Senate. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in a handful of potentially competitive states, while flipping four seats to retake a majority in 2026.",
      "While few races appear comfortably in range, Democrats have been working to recruit formidable candidates, like former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, to boost their chances. Brown's entrance into the race marks the latest recruiting victory for the party.",

      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.

      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",

Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",

That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Gold tends to be a stable asset,\" he said. \"That actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That's why gold as an asset in investment.\"",
      "President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Mining brings revenue, but renews Black Hills fight",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",
      "According to data provided by Dakota Gold, they believe the net present value for the deposits could range from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, CBS affiliate KELO-TV reported last month.",
      "Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\"Most of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\" he said. \"So we're a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\"",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\"There's a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\" said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \"It's not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It's the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\"",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold's mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur's environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\" The company is always improving its processes, she added.",

      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\"It's really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that's been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\" Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That's 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Aug 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Former Attorney General William Barr is the first person scheduled to be deposed by Congress members as questions surrounding his role in the Epstein investigation persist.",
    "story": [
      "In the hours after convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan detention cell, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr pledged to intervene personally to lead the investigation into Epstein's death.",
      "Among the first to arrive at the Metropolitan Correctional Center soon after Epstein's death in August 2019 were members of Barr's senior staff. The visit to the federal detention center by senior members of the attorney general's staff was highly unusual, a source who was there at the time and witnessed the visit told CBS News. But so was the death in custody of such a controversial figure.",
      "One source didn't recall ever seeing members of the attorney general's senior staff investigate an inmate death in more than 20 years. Another source, involved in the investigation, said such senior visits were rare, and if they occurred, usually pertained to promoting correctional programs, not investigating inmate deaths.",
      "Barr's involvement extended to a personal review of the approximately 11 hours of jail surveillance footage from the night of Epstein's death. He said in an interview with The Associated Press three months later that it showed no one had entered the area where Epstein was housed, and he concurred with the conclusion of the medical examiner: Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "Last month, after the FBI made that video public, an\u00a0analysis by CBS News identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and what it actually showed \u2014 including whether it really proves no one else entered the cell block.",
      "Now, Barr is scheduled to appear on Monday on Capitol Hill, where he will be questioned behind closed doors by members of Congress conducting a review of the Epstein matter.",
      "Sources familiar with the oversight committee's plans tell CBS News they will be asking questions about Barr's involvement in the death investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Barr for comment.",
      "The deposition of Barr, who served two Republican presidents as U.S. attorney general, comes as Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody has come under renewed, intense public and governmental scrutiny. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, issued several deposition subpoenas in August, including to Barr, former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former FBI Director James Comey.",
      "Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration who was serving his second stint as head of the Justice Department under President Trump at the time, said he was \"appalled\" when Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10, 2019, in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.",
      "Epstein was being held at the now temporarily shuttered federal detention center after being arrested on sex trafficking charges that could have carried a life sentence. His arrest came after years of questions surrounding an earlier controversial prosecutorial deal in Florida where he pleaded to state prostitution charges and a federal felony case was dropped.",
      "Scrutiny around that deal, and his subsequent death, has fueled years of suspicions and conspiracy theories. The furor also has enveloped Epstein's vast network of powerful former friends, including Mr. Trump and former President Clinton, who have disavowed him and have not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Campaign promises to \"declassify\" files related to Epstein, made by Mr. Trump and his surrogates in 2024, have led to months of political headaches for the White House.",
      "The release last month of what the Justice Department called \"raw\" surveillance video from near Epstein's cell block, rather than settling questions about the night he died, raised new ones. The analysis by CBS News flagged multiple inconsistencies between the video and the 2023 report released by the Justice Department's Inspector General on Epstein's death.",
      "As Congress steps up its inquiry, Barr is the first person scheduled\u00a0to be deposed by the committee.",
      "Barr has acknowledged what he called \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\" at the jail, but said his \"personal review\" of surveillance footage supported the conclusion that Epstein had died by suicide.",
      "As attorney general, Barr faced calls to recuse himself from Epstein's criminal case because he had previously worked for a law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, that had represented Epstein. (Their paths also indirectly crossed decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when Epstein was hired to teach at an elite private school in New York City where Barr's father was the headmaster.)",
      "Here is a look at some unanswered questions Barr may be asked based on a review of the 2023 DOJ inspector general's report, documents released by the Bureau of Prisons, and the surveillance video.",
      "Questions for Barr about Jeffrey Epstein death investigation",
      "Did the video Barr reviewed from MCC have a missing minute?",
      "Before the supposedly \"raw\" surveillance video was released last month, showing about 11 hours of footage from the night Epstein died, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that one minute right before midnight was missing was because \"every night is reset, so every night should have the same missing minute,\" from 11:59 p.m. to midnight.",
      "That was later disputed by a government source familiar with the investigation in an interview with CBS News in July. Another high-level government source said the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General are in possession of full unedited copies of the video, and those copies do not have a missing minute. Why the FBI released the video with that small segment missing is unclear, and it is not known if anything notable occurred during that minute.",
      "Does Barr still believe that \"between the time Epstein was locked in his cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of August 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30 a.m., no one entered his tier\"?",
      "Barr made that statement in 2019, but the CBS News video analysis indicates the view from the jail camera does not conclusively prove no one entered Epstein's cell block. A staircase leading to Epstein's cell block is almost entirely out of view from the camera, with just a small sliver of stairs visible. From the video released publicly, experts told CBS News it is impossible to determine whether anyone entered the jail unit and accessed the staircase without being captured on the recording.",
      "Just before 10:40 p.m., the video shows a glimpse of an orange shape moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The inspector general's report said that it was a jail staffer bringing orange linens or inmate clothing up the stairs. Some video forensic experts who reviewed that footage at the request of CBS News said they were skeptical about that interpretation. They suggested the shape could be a person dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit climbing the stairs. Inmates were typically confined to their cells late at night.",
      "What did the DOJ do to investigate theories other than suicide?",
      "No evidence has surfaced suggesting that anyone else was involved in Epstein's death. He had been placed on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to hang himself a month before, and remained under heightened observation. However, there do remain significant unanswered questions about his death, some of which were raised in a \"60 Minutes\" report in 2020 looking at the medical evidence. Those included questions relating to the autopsy.",
      "A private autopsy commissioned by Epstein's family, conducted alongside the official examination by the medical examiner, raised concerns about the angle of the ligature marks on his neck and the presence of broken neck bones, findings that suggested a level of force greater than typically associated with a hanging. The medical examiner disputed that, saying such fractures can occur in suicides.",

    "summary": "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff says Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called them \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: After President Trump's Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, we will go one-on-one with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Following the Russian president's warm welcome to Alaska and a three-hour meeting that ended abruptly, President Trump adopts Putin's road map for ending the war in Ukraine, no cease-fire, but negotiations for a lasting peace in the 3.5-year conflict.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I think the meeting was a 10 in the sense that we got along great. And it's good when two big powers get along.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the other countries, like Ukraine and its Western allies, who are still tightly aligned?",
      "Along with Rubio, we will hear from Trump's former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill, Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, and Colorado Democrat Jason Crow.",
      "Plus, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres will join us following his trip to Gaza.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders are heading to Washington Monday to meet with President Trump to discuss next steps following Mr. Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. The awkward conclusion to Friday's summit yielded no formal agreement, with Vladimir Putin still insisting that Ukraine turn over the lands seized by Russia in the war, plus additional territory, something that President Zelenskyy continues to refuse.",
      "We begin with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the cease- fire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement.",
      "Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.",
      "But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into \u2013 it's just so long.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of \u2013 you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting.",
      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.",
      "They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half \u2013 you know, it's on the other side of the world.",
      "That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them.",
      "And, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they \u2013 as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.",
      "But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",

      "Good morning.",
      "JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main \u2013 one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And \u2013 and that's how \u2013 what I have to report with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",
      "So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.",
      "I can say that where we are, obviously people are \u2013 are \u2013 are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.",
      "But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 09:39:06 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 08:20:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Up to 500 people stayed at the eight Grand Teton National Park cabins that were affected, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Health officials are working to alert hundreds of people in dozens of states and several countries who may have been exposed to rabies in bat-infested cabins in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park over the past few months.",
      "As of Friday, none of the bats found in some of the eight linked cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge had tested positive for rabies.",
      "But the handful of dead bats found and sent to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie for testing were probably only a small sample of the likely dozens that colonized the attic above the row of cabins, Wyoming State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said.",
      "Other bats weren't killed but got shooed out through the cabin doors and windows. Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.",
      "Health officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.",
      "\"What we're really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat,\" Harrist said Friday.",
      "The cabins have been unoccupied, with no plans to reopen, since concessionaire Grand Teton Lodge Company discovered the bat problem on July 27.",
      "Bats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur \u2014 muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few \u2014 rabies is almost always fatal in humans.",
      "The good news is that a five-shot prophylactic regimen over two weeks soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.",
      "The cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.",
      "They were trying to reach people in 38 states and seven countries through those states' health agencies and, in the case of foreign visitors, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Others who have not been alerted yet but stayed in cabins 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530 this year should tell health officials or a doctor immediately, Harrist said.",
      "Health officials were recommending prophylactic shots for people who fit certain criteria, such as deep sleepers who found a bat in their room, and children too young to say that they had seen a bat.",
      "The Wyoming Department of Health had no ongoing concern about visitor safety at the Jackson Lake Lodge area. That includes a Federal Reserve economic policy symposium Aug. 21-23 that takes place at Jackson Lake Lodge every summer.",
      "\"The lodge company has done a fantastic job of doing their due diligence of making sure everyone that is coming in for that, and for all other visits this year, are going to be as safe as possible,\" said Emily Curren, Wyoming's public health veterinarian.",
      "\"Three or four\" dead bats from the cabins tested negative and one that was mangled did not have enough brain tissue to be testable, Curren said.",
      "All were brown bats, which come in two species: \"little\" and \"big,\" with the larger ones more than twice as big. Officials were unsure which species these were, but both are common in Wyoming.",
      "They typically live in colonies of 30 to 100 individuals, Curren said.",
      "\"That's a lot of bats that we cannot rule out a risk of rabies being in,\" Curren said. \"There's no way for us to know for certain about every single bat that got into these rooms.\"",
      "There are no plans to exterminate the bats, Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis said. Devices fitted to the building were keeping the bats from getting back in after flying out in pursuit of insects to eat, they said.",

    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",
      "While the cost of American cheese is up 0.7% from July 2024, according to BLS data, it is down 2.6% from last month.",
      "Iceberg lettuce is 3.9% lower in cost than it was a year ago, according to July CPI data, while the price of romaine lettuce is 4.6% higher.",

      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",

    "summary": "Erin is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, and meteorologists are closely tracking its path and forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin is likely to bring \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" across the U.S. East Coast this week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday.",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, restrengthened back into a Category 4 storm Sunday night as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. It\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening to a Category 3 early Sunday morning, then regaining strength again later in the day.",
      "As of 8 a.m. EDT Monday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. The storm's center was about 115 miles north-northeast of Grand Turk Island and about 890 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It was moving northwest at 13 mph.",
      "A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 130-156 mph and is considered a major storm, capable of causing catastrophic damage.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin is a large storm that's expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said. It is not expected to make landfall in the U.S.",
      "\"The core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States by the middle of the week,\" the hurricane center said Monday.",
      "The hurricane center said some additional strengthening is expected today and then Erin may begin to weaken tonight, though it will \"remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.\"",
      "Forecasters said Erin's hurricane-force winds \u2014 74 mph or higher \u2014 extend outward up to 80 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 230 miles.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, the hurricane center said. The Bahamas government issued a tropical storm watch for the central Bahamas. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "On the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials with the National Park Service\u00a0announced\u00a0that sites on the island of St. Croix would be closed starting late Friday afternoon until after the storm passes.",
      "Erin's path continued to curve northward, with the center of the hurricane passing just to the north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands.",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch explained.",
      "How will Hurricane Erin affect the U.S.?",
      "Erin is not forecast to hit the U.S. directly, but coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard will feel its effects with dangerous rip currents and high waves of 20+ feet over the next several days.",
      "\"These rough ocean conditions will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,\" the National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "North Carolina's Outer Banks, in particular, should monitor the progress of Erin, the hurricane center advised, noting that In addition to rip currents, \"there is a risk of strong winds associated with the outer rainbands during the middle part of the week.\"",
      "On Hatteras Island, a mandatory evacuation of\u00a0Dare County Hurricane Evacuation Zone A has been declared.",
      "Gusty winds and flooding tides could wash out parts of the highway that connects the North Carolina Outer Banks by midweek, and they roads remain impassible or inaccessible for several days, the National Weather Service said.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Monday west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday as the U.S. pursues a long-lasting peace agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the meeting early Saturday, following his\u00a0summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, the president said the meeting with Putin \"went very well,\" adding that the same was true of a phone call with Zelenskyy and various European leaders after the fact.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C., the Oval Office, on Monday afternoon,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\"",
      "European and NATO leaders are expected to accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said she was joining at \"the request of President Zelenskyy.\"",
      "Though the nearly three-hour-long meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents on Friday failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought, the administration has since pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to get there.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said, noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "The secretary of state, who attended Friday's summit meeting with Putin, indicated that enough progress was made to sit down with Zelenskyy to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "Rubio said the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories and the issue of rebuilding the country still need to be discussed and \"require some more specificity.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer \"game-changing\" security guarantees, including a possible arrangement in which the allies provide \"Article 5-like protection\" to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member nation is considered an attack against all. Putin has been vehemently opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, but a similar security guarantee outside the framework of the alliance might reassure Kyiv that Russia would be deterred from attacking in the future.",
      "Witkoff noted that the administration intends to discuss a possible land swap at Monday's meeting.",
      "\"We're not waiting a week for a meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders,\" Witkoff said. \"We are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, very, very quickly. Quicker than a ceasefire.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Mr. Trump said, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Mr. Trump was referring to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in early 2014.",
      "In a\u00a0post on X, Zelenskyy said he'd arrived in Washington for the talks and insisted, \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.\"",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued, with a wave of air strikes hitting cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. Ukrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv overnight killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.",
      "\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"",
      "Russian state media reported Ukraine had carried out a drone attack in Donetsk, overnight which killed a 62-year-old woman.",
      "Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy comes months after a contentious February Oval Office meeting between the two leaders and Vice President JD Vance exposed a severe rift, with tensions erupting on camera as Vance accused Zelenskyy of ingratitude. In recent months, Mr. Trump's posture appeared to shift as he expressed frustration with Putin over Russia's ongoing drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.",

    "story": [
      "A Hong Kong court heard final arguments Monday in the landmark national security trial of former pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, who could be sentenced to up to life in prison if he is convicted.",
      "Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following anti-government protests in 2019. He is being tried on charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications.",
      "Lai founded Apple Daily, one of the local media outlets that was most critical of Hong Kong's government. His high-profile case has stretched nearly 150 days, almost double the original estimate, and is widely seen as a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.",
      "It is unclear when a verdict will be delivered, and closing arguments in the trial were expected to last about eight days, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said on Monday that Lai was arrested for collusion in August 2020, but he continued to make requests for sanctions, a blockade or other hostile activities in the following months.",
      "Chau suggested that the appeals for foreign actions did not only target individuals, but also China, while the foreign collaborations Lai had were long-term and persistent.",
      "A prosecution document shown in court argued that the law doesn't prohibit normal international exchanges. But how Lai attempted to draw an analogy of what he did to the cooperation between Hong Kong's prosecuting authority and the International Association of Prosecutors was bewildering.",
      "\"It is surprising to see that D1 (Lai) raised freedoms of thought and association as his shield,\" it said in the document.",
      "Chau is expected to wrap up his closing statement Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, prosecutors alleged Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing \"under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "On the first day of his testimony, Lai denied he had asked then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against Hong Kong and China during the 2019 protests.",
      "When Lai's lawyer questioned him about an Apple Daily report saying he had asked the U.S. government to sanction Beijing and Hong Kong leaders, he said he must have discussed it with Pompeo, as he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report by the now-defunct newspaper he founded.",
      "But Lai said he would not have encouraged foreign sanctions after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020.",
      "Closing arguments have been delayed twice, first due to the weather then to concerns over Lai's health.",
      "On Friday, his lawyer, Robert Pang, said Lai had experienced heart palpitations while in prison. The judges wanted him to secure a heart monitor and medication first.",
      "After Friday's hearing, the Hong Kong government alleged foreign media outlets had attempted to mislead the public about Lai's medical care. It said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom on Monday, he waved and smiled to those sitting in the public gallery and briefly instructed his legal team in a voice audible to public attendees. He closed his eyes at times when the prosecution laid out its legal arguments.",
      "The heart monitor was delivered to Lai and he had no complaints about his health, Chau said.",
      "Lai's yearslong detention in solidarity confinement has drawn concerns from foreign governments and rights groups. President Trump, before being elected to his second term in November, said he would talk to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release. \"I will get him out,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In a Fox News radio interview released Aug. 14, Mr. Trump denied saying he would save Lai, but rather that he would bring the issue up.",
      "\"I've already brought it up, and I'm going to do everything I can to save him,\" he said.",
      "China has accused Lai of stirring a rise in anti-China sentiments in Hong Kong and said it firmly opposes the interference of other countries in its internal affairs.",
      "Dozens of people waited in the rain Monday for a seat in the main courtroom to see Lai.",
      "Former Apple Daily reader Susan Li said she worried about Lai's health as he looked visibly thinner and she would continue to pray for him. \"I wanted to let him know we are still here,\" she said.",
      "When Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city's civil liberties for 50 years. But critics say the promise has become threadbare after the introduction of the security law, which Chinese and Hong Kong authorities insist was necessary for the city's stability.",

    "summary": "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff says Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called them \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday wrote on social media, \"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\"",
      "Zelenskyy and European leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "Rubio said of the talks with Russia, \"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said on social media that he had arrived in Washington, D.C., for Monday's meeting, but pushed back on the Trump administration's comments about ceding territory to Russia.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East\u2014part of Donbas\u2014and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,\" Zelenskyy wrote, adding \"Crimea should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022.\"",
      "\"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace. Thank you!\"",

    "story": [
      "European and NATO leaders announced Sunday that they'll be joining President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington for crucial talks with President Trump, rallying around the Ukrainian leader after his exclusion from Mr. Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The remarkable move \u2014 with one European leader after another announcing that they'll be at Zelenskyy's side when he travels to the White House on Monday \u2014 was an apparent effort to ensure that the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated the Ukrainian president in a heated Oval Office encounter.",
      "\"The Europeans are very afraid of the Oval Office scene being repeated and so they want to support Mr. Zelenskyy to the hilt,\" said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations.",
      "\"It's a power struggle and a position of strength that might work with Trump,\" he said in a phone interview.",
      "The European leaders' presence at Zelenskyy's side, demonstrating Europe's support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Mr. Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to provide the Ukrainian president with backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary outlined that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether all or just some of the European leaders would be taking part in the actual meeting with Mr. Trump.",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday night said he had arrived in Washington, D.C., and was \"grateful\" for Mr. Trump's invitation.",
      "\"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting.

    "summary": "Protesters in Israel escalated their ongoing campaign on Sunday to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Protesters in Israel participated in a nationwide strike on Sunday to demand a deal that would result in a ceasefire with Hamas and the release of hostages who remain in Gaza. The \"day of stoppage,\" which blocked roads and closed businesses, marked an escalation in the population's growing frustration after 22 months of war.",
      "Police responding to Sunday's demonstrations blasted crowds with water cannons and made dozens of arrests. In one instance, officers stopped several protesters from trying to break into the central Ayalon highway in Tel Aviv, leading to a confrontation between them during which a protester was forcibly arrested, CBS News learned. Police also confiscated the protesters' equipment.",
      "The \"day of stoppage\" was organized by two groups representing some of the families of hostages and bereaved families, weeks after militant groups released videos of hostages and Israel announced plans for a new military offensive in some of Gaza's most populated areas.",
      "Protesters, who fear further fighting could endanger the 50 hostages believed to remain in Gaza, only about 20 of whom are thought to be alive, chanted: \"We don't win a war over the bodies of hostages.\"",
      "Protesters gathered at dozens of points throughout Israel, including outside politicians' homes, military headquarters and on major highways, where they were sprayed with water cannons as they blocked lanes and lit bonfires that cloaked roads in smoke. Some restaurants and theaters were closed in solidarity.",
      "Police said they had arrested 32 as part of the nationwide demonstration \u2014 one of the fiercest since the uproar over six hostages found dead in Gaza last September.",
      "\"Military pressure doesn't bring hostages back \u2014 it only kills them,\" former hostage Arbel Yehoud said at a demonstration in Tel Aviv's hostage square. \"The only way to bring them back is through a deal, all at once, without games.\"",
      "\"Today, we stop everything to save and bring back the hostages and soldiers. Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,\" said Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest. \"Today, we stop everything to join hands \u2014 right, left, center and everything in between.\"",
      "Protesters at highway intersections handed out yellow ribbons, the symbol that represents the hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which organized the stoppage, said.",
      "Even though Israel's largest labor union, Histadrut, ultimately did not join Sunday's action, strikes of this magnitude are relatively rare in Israel. Many businesses and municipalities decided independently to strike.",
      "Still, an end to the conflict does not appear near. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the immediate release of the hostages but is balancing competing pressures, haunted by the potential for mutiny within his coalition.",
      "Israeli leaders criticize demonstrations",
      "Netanyahu addressed the protests on Sunday at a cabinet meeting, saying they were benefiting Hamas.",
      "\"Those who are calling today for an end to the war without Hamas' elimination are not only hardening Hamas' position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves and that we will have to fight an endless war,\" the prime minister said.",
      "Far-right members of his cabinet insist they won't support any deal that allows Hamas to retain power. The last time Israel agreed to a ceasefire that released hostages, they threatened to topple Netanyahu's government.",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday called the stoppage \"a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas' hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.\"",
      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in a statement, accused protesters of trying to \"weaken Israel.\" Like Smotrich, he said the strike \"strengthens Hamas and delays the return of the hostages.\"",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry reported that 47 people were killed and at least 226 were wounded across the territory in the last 24 hours alone. Meanwhile, hospitals and eyewitnesses in Gaza reported at least 17 aid-seekers had been killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, including nine awaiting aid trucks close to the Morag corridor. The death toll among Palestinians waiting for food and other aid in Gaza has climbed this summer, sparking outcry around the world as\u00a0starvation and malnutrition run rampant in the enclave.",
      "Hamza Asfour said he was just north of the corridor, awaiting a convoy, when Israeli snipers fired, first to disperse the crowds, then from tanks hundreds of meters away.",
      "He saw two people with gunshot wounds \u2014 one in the chest and other in the shoulder.",
      "\"It's either to take this risk or wait and see my family die of starvation,\" he said. \"There is no other option.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the distribution points, said there was no gunfire Sunday \"at or near\" its sites, which sit at the end of aid truck routes.",
      "Israel's military did not immediately respond to questions about strikes in the three areas.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and displaced most of the population. The United Nations is warning that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began.",
      "The Hamas-led attack in 2023 killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 61,897 people in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
      "2 more children die from malnutrition-related causes",
      "On Sunday, two children died of malnutrition-related causes in Gaza, bringing the death toll from such causes over the last 24 hours to seven, according to Gaza's health ministry. The total number of deaths related to starvation has risen to 251, including 110 children, said the health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "While demonstrators in Israel demanded a ceasefire, Israel began preparing for an invasion of Gaza City and other populated parts of the besieged strip, aimed at destroying Hamas.",
      "The military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza said Sunday that the supply of tents to the territory would resume. COGAT said it would allow the United Nations to resume importing tents and shelter equipment into Gaza ahead of plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones \"for their protection.\"",
      "The majority of assistance has been blocked from entering Gaza since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after a ceasefire collapsed when Israel restarted its offensive. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed. Some have accused Israel of \"weaponizing aid\" through blockades and rules they say turn humanitarian assistance into a tool of its political and military goals.",
      "Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen's capital on Sunday, escalating strikes on Iran-backed Houthis, who, since the war began, have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea.",
      "Both the IDF and a Houthi-run television station in Yemen announced the strikes. Al-Masirah Television said they targeted a power plant in the southern district of Sanhan, sparking a fire and knocking it out of service, the Yemeni station said. Israel's military said Sunday's strikes targeted energy infrastructure it claimed was being used by the Houthis, and were launched in response to missiles and drones aimed at Israel.",
      "While some projectiles have breached its missile defenses \u2014 notably during its 12-day war with Iran in June \u2014 Israel has intercepted the vast majority of missiles launched from Yemen.",
      "U.S. blocks visitor visas from Gaza",
      "The U.S. Department of State on Saturday announced that it would stop issuing visitor visas for people from Gaza.",
      "\"All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,\" the department wrote in a social media post.",
      "Some humanitarian groups have condemned the pause because those visas may be issued to people in need of medical treatment abroad, CBS News partner BBC News reported.",
      "The nonprofit organization Palestine Children's Relief Fund said in a statement to BBC News that the decision \"will have a devastating and irreversible impact on our ability to bring injured and critically ill children from Gaza to the United States for lifesaving medical treatment.\"",

      "Local authorities are working with the judiciary, forensic investigations, Iraq's Martyrs' Foundation, and the directorate of mass graves to carry out the excavation of the site of a sinkhole in al-Khafsa, south of the northern city of Mosul, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday.",
      "Ahmad Qusay al-Asady, head of the Martyrs Foundation's mass graves excavation department, told The Associated Press that his team began work at Khasfa on Aug. 9 at the request of Nineveh province's Gov. Abdulqadir al-Dakhil.",
      "The operation is initially limited to gathering visible human remains and surface evidence while preparing for a full exhumation that officials say will require international support.",
      "After an initial 15 days of work, the foundation's Mosul teams will build a database and start collecting DNA samples from families of suspected victims.",
      "Al-Asady explained that laboratory processing and a DNA database must come first to ensure proper identification. Full exhumations can only proceed once specialized assistance is secured to navigate the site's hazards, including sulfur water and unexploded ordnance.",
      "Khasfa is \"a very complicated site,\" he said.",
      "Based on unverified accounts from witnesses and families and other unofficial testimonies, authorities estimate that thousands of bodies could be buried there, he said.",
      "Scores of mass graves containing thousands of bodies of people believed to have been killed by ISIS\u00a0have been found in Iraq and Syria.",
      "Some of the mass graves found in Iraq over the past two decades are believed to date back to the early 1990s, during Saddam Hussein's regime. Other mass graves include bodies of women and children.",
      "At its peak, ISIS ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Syria and was notorious for its brutality. It beheaded civilians and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities. The extremist group has boasted of massacring Shiites and other opponents, often releasing gruesome videos and pictures of the killings.",
      "The group was defeated in Iraq in July 2017, when Iraqi forces captured the northern city of Mosul. Three months later, it suffered a major blow when Kurdish forces captured the Syrian northern city of Raqqa, which was the group's de facto capital. The war against ISIS officially ended in March 2019, when U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, which was the last sliver of land the extremists controlled.",
      "Rabah Nouri Attiyah, a lawyer who has worked on more than 70 cases of missing people in Nineveh, told the AP that information he obtained from the foundation and different Iraqi courts during his investigations points to Khasfa as \"the largest mass grave in modern Iraqi history.\"",
      "Al-Asady, however, said investigators \"cannot confirm yet if it is the largest mass grave\" to be found in Iraq, \"but according to the size of the space, we estimate it to be one of the largest.\"",
      "Attiyah said roughly 70% of the human remains at Khasfa are believed to belong to Iraqi army and police personnel, with other victims including Yazidis.",
      "He said he has interviewed numerous eyewitnesses from the area who saw IS fighters bring people there by bus and kill them. \"Many of them were decapitated,\" he said.",
      "Attiyah's own uncle and cousin were police officers killed by IS, and he is among those hoping to identify and recover the remains of loved ones.",
      "Testimonies and witness statements, as well as findings from other mass graves in Nineveh, indicate that most of the military, police and other security forces personnel killed by IS are expected to be found at Khasfa, along with Yazidis from Sinjar and Shiite victims from Tal Afar, he said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",

      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

      "Fox News Digital spoke with APCO International Executive Director and CEO Mel Maier on the need to invest in next-generation 911.",
      "Healthcare institutions have become a favorite target for bad actors, largely because of how easy they make it for attackers. In June, researchers discovered a healthcare data breach that exposed the personal information of around 8 million patients. All of this information was publicly accessible online without any passwords or authentication protocols.",
      "The latest healthcare organization to fall victim to a breach is DaVita, which has put nearly a million people at risk. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita provides dialysis treatment to about 200,000 patients across the U.S. and 13 other countries.",

      "What you need to know DaVita ransomware attack",
      "Kidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack (via Comparitech). The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.",
      "DaVita says the incident disrupted internal operations and primarily affected its laboratories. In its latest notice to victims, the company says the cyberattack began March 24, 2025, and continued until April 12. It has not confirmed whether a ransom was paid.",
      "Ransomware gang Interlock claimed responsibility on April 25, posting screenshots of alleged stolen documents and saying it took 1.5TB of DaVita's data. The group lists the company on its public leak site, where it pressures victims by threatening to sell or release stolen files.",
      "DaVita is offering eligible breach victims free identity restoration services through Experian, with a Nov. 28 enrollment deadline. The company has not confirmed how attackers gained access to its network or the size of the ransom demand.",

Healthcare targets have included Texas Digestive Specialists, Kettering Health and Naper Grove Vision Care, all of which reported data breaches in 2025.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The DaVita incident is the second-largest U.S. healthcare ransomware attack by number of records this year, behind Frederick Health's January breach.

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Since your personal details were exposed in the DaVita breach, you're more vulnerable to targeted fraud. Consider using a personal data removal service to scrub your personal details from data broker websites that sell your information.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "DaVita is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't a victim of this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself.",
      "Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",

      "How cigarette butts are recycled into road material",
      "The recycling process involves several steps:",
      "1. Collecting and sorting: Filters from traditional and e-cigarettes go through a collection and cleaning process. Ash and residue are removed, leaving behind usable fiber material.",
      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

      "Google Gemini app on a mobile device\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gemini summaries can be hacked",
      "Researchers at Mozilla's 0Din have discovered a vulnerability in Google's Gemini for Workspace that allows attackers to inject hidden instructions into email summaries. The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",
      "In a proof of concept, Gemini falsely warned a user that a Gmail password had been compromised and included a fake support phone number. Since Gemini summaries are integrated into Google Workspace, you are more likely to trust the information, making this tactic especially effective.",

      "In a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us, and we've deployed numerous strong defenses to keep users safe, including safeguards to prevent harmful or misleading responses. We are constantly hardening our already robust defenses through red-teaming exercises that train our models to defend against these types of adversarial attacks.\"",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",

      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",

If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent looking for a low-cost way to track where your child's shoes are, this is a creative solution. It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

      "Creators benefit, too. When someone reposts your content, it can reach that person's followers, even if they don't follow you, opening the door to new audiences.",

      "Explore and share with Friend Map",

      "If you're a parent with supervision tools enabled, you'll be notified if your teen turns on location sharing. You can also disable the feature for them.",
      "Location updates occur when you open the app or return to it from the background. Beyond location sharing, the map also lets you explore stories, reels, and notes tagged with a location from friends and creators you follow.",
      "Friend Map allows you to opt in to sharing your last active location with a select group of friends. (Meta)",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you love staying connected on Instagram, these tools give you more ways to share and discover content with people you care about. But the Friend Map feature demands extra attention. If you decide to turn it on, take time to customize your sharing settings. Think about who really needs to see your location and review your choices regularly. For parents, this is a good opportunity to talk with teens about online privacy.",

Reposts make it easier to share what inspires you, Friends tab helps spark conversations, and Friend Map opens the door to spontaneous meetups, but only if you manage privacy wisely. The good news: you're in control of what you share and with whom.",

Around the same time, Vappie\u2019s wife filed for divorce, citing the alleged relationship in court filings, according to local reports.",
      "A unit in the Pontalba Apartments, a historic city-owned property in the French Quarter, has long been considered a ceremonial perk of the mayor\u2019s office, used to host visiting dignitaries, Mardi Gras festivities and other official functions, not as a permanent residence.",

In another message, Cantrell allegedly wrote, \"The times when we are truly alone (traveling) is what spoils me the most\".",
      "Prosecutors further allege Cantrell tried to cover up the relationship by deleting messages, activating a setting to make them disappear within 24 hours and lying under oath to a federal grand jury about turning over all requested evidence, withholding more than 50 photos from her personal devices.",

She terminated IV Waste\u2019s sanitation contract, widely praised for its cleaning services, in favor of a personally-connected firm via an emergency declaration, sparking backlash from City Council officials and a filing from the Louisiana Attorney General condemning the move as an \"abuse of emergency powers.\"",

Footage showed her diffusing a tense standoff; her communications director at the time praised her for intervening, calling it living her motto: \"if you see something, do something.\"",
      "Also in 2022, activist and former Cantrell staffer Eileen Carter and community figure Belden \"Noonie Man\" Batiste launched a recall campaign claiming the mayor had \"failed to put New\u202fOrleans first and execute the responsibilities of the position.\" Despite submitting tens of thousands of signatures, organizers fell well short. According to Ballotpedia, about 67,000 signatures were submitted, but only 27,243 were validated, far below the nearly 45,000 required for triggering a recall election.",

      "If found guilty, the potential maximum penalties are up to five years for conspiracy to commit wire fraud; up to 20 years per count for wire fraud; up to 20 years for conspiracy to obstruct justice; up to five years for Vappie\u2019s false-statement charge; up to 20 years for Cantrell\u2019s obstruction charge; and up to five years per count for Cantrell\u2019s false-declaration charges.",

      "But there is one more element to the meetings that has security experts worried \u2013 Zelenskyy\u2019s absence.",
      "Though the meeting was apparently pushed by Putin, who has thus far refused to meet with Zelenskyy despite the Ukrainian president\u2019s calls to do so, his absence when discussing a war taking place on his nation\u2019s soil could speak volumes to China.",

      "Ultimately, he argued, \"If aggression pays in Europe, deterrence discounts in Asia.\"",

The U.N. must be held accountable to pick up and distribute such aid. I urge you to launch an independent investigation into this matter to determine the extent to which U.N. agencies, by refusing to coordinate with the IDF on essential issues, including security, are abusing U.S. taxpayer funds rather than using them to deliver the aid the American people are donating \u2013 and whether such actions are being taken independently by U.N. officials in Gaza or at the direction of the U.N.

    "story": [
      "CLEVELAND \u2014 Former Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, launched a comeback campaign Monday, setting the stage for a 2026 special election that could decide partisan control of the Senate.",
      "Brown will challenge Sen. Jon Husted, the Republican whom Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine appointed this year to fill the vacancy created by JD Vance\u2019s election as vice president.",
      "\u201cWe had no intention, really, of running again,\u201d Brown, speaking of himself and his wife, journalist Connie Schultz, said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cWe just heard from more and more people and saw how much worse it was getting. I spent my career, as you know, taking on interest groups and taking on this rigged system. And the system has been rigged for as long as I remember, but it\u2019s clearly gotten worse.\u201d",
      "In a video accompanying his campaign launch, Brown lays out three principles important to him: \u201cstanding up for workers, treating everyone with dignity and respect, working as hard as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to run for office again, but when I see what\u2019s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\u201d Brown says in the video. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m running for Senate.\u201d",
      "Brown, 72, lost his race for a fourth term last year to Republican Bernie Moreno by about 3.5 percentage points as President Donald Trump carried Ohio by 11 points. Word of his decision to run for Senate \u2014 and not for governor, as many Ohio Democrats had been hoping \u2014 trickled out last week, reported first by Cleveland.com and confirmed by NBC News.",
      "In a statement, Husted campaign spokesperson Tyson Shepard said Brown\u2019s announcement \u201cmeans Ohioans will face a clear choice in 2026.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor 30 years, he has imposed Washington\u2019s problems on Ohio, pushing radical liberal policies that have left a lasting burden on the next generation,\u201d Shepard added, referring to Brown. \u201cJon Husted offers the opposite approach, applying Ohio\u2019s values and solutions to fix a broken Washington.\u201d",
      "Next year\u2019s clash will determine who serves the two years remaining on the term Vance won in 2022. Brown was noncommittal when asked if he would seek a full six-year term in 2028 if he beats Husted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI really, legitimately, don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had aggressively lobbied Brown to choose a Senate bid over a run for governor and traveled twice to Ohio to persuade him to take on Husted. Brown and former Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina are two prized recruits in the Democrats\u2019 battle to win back the Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections. With Republicans defending a 53-47 majority in the chamber, Democrats would need to net four seats.",
      "After losing his re-election campaign last year, Brown and Schultz relocated from Cleveland to Bexley, Ohio, the Columbus suburb that\u2019s home to the governor\u2019s mansion. The move, which placed Brown and Schultz closer to their grandchildren and to Schultz\u2019s teaching job at Denison University, nonetheless fueled chatter that he was leaning more toward a run for governor. In the meantime, Brown launched the Dignity of Work Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on workers issues.",
      "Brown said it wasn\u2019t just Schumer pushing him in one direction or another. He and Schultz heard from people everywhere, from the grocery store to their local Fourth of July parade.",
      "\u201cThe decision was mine and Connie\u2019s, and it was a hard decision, because I think I could do good work in either place,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut ultimately, because Ohio doesn\u2019t have anybody in the Senate advocating for Ohio workers, I came down on that decision. I mean, it\u2019s hard times for this state, it\u2019s hard times for people. I could have gone either way in that case, but I just think I can have more impact in the Senate.\u201d",
      "Brown singled out Husted\u2019s vote for the Trump-backed \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d a megabill that has come under fire for its cuts to Medicaid and other federal safety net programs. Brown said he\u2019s specifically worried about Ohioans losing health insurance coverage in a state where, more than a decade ago, a Republican governor pushed through Medicaid expansion.",
      "\u201cThe worst has been the big, whatever they call it \u2014 big, ugly bill, big, beautiful bill,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBy any measure, this is the worst vote he\u2019s cast in the Senate, but it\u2019s a continuum of his running for special interests his whole career.\u201d",
      "Husted, 57, like Brown, has spent much of his adult life in public office. He served as the Ohio House speaker in the 2000s and as secretary of state \u2014 a job Brown held in the 1980s \u2014 in the 2010s. Most recently, Husted served as DeWine\u2019s lieutenant governor.",
      "In a joint statement Monday, Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, cheered Brown's decision.",
      "\u201cNo one fights harder for Ohio than Sherrod Brown,\u201d they said. \u201cFrom securing Ohioans\u2019 retirement and Social Security benefits to cracking down on fentanyl from China and Mexico, Sherrod will always do what\u2019s right for Ohioans.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For three years, Mike Davis, a Republican lawyer and former legal counsel to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has pushed for federal criminal investigations of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and senior FBI, CIA and Justice Department officials.",
      "Now, a series of recent investigations approved by Attorney General Pam Bondi suggests to Davis that his long-sought goal is most likely approaching.",
      "Bondi this month approved two federal criminal investigations of New York Attorney General Letitia James and one of Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Bondi also instructed an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 election.",
      "Bondi\u2019s order came weeks after National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard accused Obama and his aides of a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d and said she had sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department.",
      "Davis applauded Bondi\u2019s actions in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest conspiracy in American history,\u201d he said, referring to what he says are Democratic plots against President Donald Trump. \u201cThere must be the most severe legal, political and financial consequences for this unprecedented weaponization. This must never happen again.\u201d",
      "Bondi\u2019s office and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Obama, Biden, Clinton and former FBI, Justice Department and CIA officials have repeatedly dismissed the allegations. Democrats say new probes are an effort to distract attention from allegations that Trump has abused his power in his second term and from his failure to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.",
      "Former senior Justice Department and FBI officials note that a Trump-appointed special counsel and Republican senators already investigated the claims and found no crimes. They called the idea \u201cabsurd,\u201d \u201cbananas\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201d",
      "Davis said he is unaware of Bondi\u2019s next step. But he praised the recent party-line Senate confirmation of a new U.S. attorney in South Florida, Jason Reding Qui\u00f1ones, whom he called a personal friend and urged senators to support.",
      "\u201cI want Jason to set up his own grand jury and pursue this aggressively,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd I want him to put criminals in prison for a very long time.\u201d",
      "Road map for a Florida federal investigation",
      "Davis called for Qui\u00f1ones to convene a special federal grand jury in Port St. Lucie, the seat of St. Lucie County, which Trump carried by 10 percentage points last year. It would investigate what he calls a Democratic conspiracy to undermine Trump stretching from the 2016 campaign to the 2022 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate to today.",
      "Qui\u00f1ones, a Miami-Dade County judge appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis a year ago, is a former federal prosecutor in Miami and a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve. He was a major crimes prosecutor but received poor performance evaluations, The Miami Herald reported. Qui\u00f1ones filed and dropped a racial discrimination complaint and moved to the Civil Division, where he received satisfactory reviews.",
      "Qui\u00f1ones and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Viewing the Mar-a-Lago search as part of a decadelong anti-Trump conspiracy serves a legal purpose: It could allow prosecutors to treat alleged acts from 2016 and 2017 as part of a single conspiracy and bypass a five-year statute of limitations on denial of rights charges.",
      "Three former FBI and Justice Department officials with direct knowledge of the Mar-a-Lago search told NBC News that it was conducted properly and approved by a federal judge and that it was the result of Trump\u2019s own actions.",
      "The officials said the National Archives first alerted them that Trump appeared to have classified materials. Trump then declined repeated requests to return the documents for a year. A former senior Justice Department official dismissed Davis\u2019 calls for a criminal investigation of the Mar-a-Lago search.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d the former senior Justice Department official said.",
      "Multiple investigations of Democratic rivals underway",
      "Three people familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News this month that the Justice Department has opened a federal criminal investigation of lawsuits James\u2019 office filed against Trump. James has dismissed the Justice Department investigation, which is based in Albany, New York, as political payback.",
      "The James probe is examining whether the state attorney general\u2019s office committed \u201cconspiracy against rights\u201d and violated Trump\u2019s civil rights when it brought a lawsuit that claimed Trump grossly inflated the values of his assets for personal profit. A Manhattan judge ruled last year that Trump did so and ordered him to pay a roughly $500 million fine, a ruling that infuriated him.",
      "Separately, the Bondi Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation in Virginia into possible mortgage fraud by James and another into Schiff in connection with an allegation of potential mortgage fraud in Maryland. James and Schiff have said the investigations are political retribution. Bondi appointed Ed Martin, a Trump loyalist who represented Jan. 6 defendants and praised Trump\u2019s mass pardons of them, to oversee both probes.",
      "Davis said the \u201cconspiracy against rights\u201d charge could be used in the Florida investigation he believes should be conducted. Legal experts have noted that the charge was created by the Enforcement Act of 1870, which Congress passed to prevent white people from blocking freed slaves from voting.",
      "Davis said special counsel Jack Smith used the same charge when he accused Trump of trying to illegally reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats set the precedent that former presidents are fair game,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Could Democrats be indicted and convicted?",
      "Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor whom Republicans have accused of conspiring with former FBI Director James Comey, said filing criminal charges based on debunked claims is possible. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to ignore the facts,\u201d Richman said, \u201cyou can come up with criminal charges.\u201d",
      "But Richman cautioned that securing a federal indictment, trial and conviction \u2014 even in areas where the majority of voters voted for Trump \u2014 would be difficult given the many actors and elements involved. Prosecutors need indictments from grand juries, judges can dismiss weak cases, witnesses must be credible, and jurors must unanimously agree on guilt.",
      "\u201cJurors take their duties seriously,\u201d Richman said. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to say the people in these jurisdictions are totally in the tank for this administration.\u201d",
      "A former senior national security official who spoke anonymously, citing the Trump administration\u2019s public attacks on former officials, suggested two potential scenarios: \u201cEither Bondi and Gabbard know that there is indeed no evidence of any criminal activity, in which case it\u2019s completely corrupt and a political stunt,\u201d the former official said, \u201cor, more darkly, they actually believe this stuff and are acting out of authoritarian instinct and this is something out of Orwell.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon at the White House, just days after Trump and Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin left an Alaska summit without a ceasefire deal.",
      "Zelenskyy is traveling to Washington, D.C., alongside several European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trump\u2019s sit-down with the leaders will come as he\u2019s intensified his efforts in recent weeks to end the war in Ukraine, a more than three-year conflict he insists would not have taken place had he been in office.",
      "Following his meeting with Putin, Trump shifted his aim toward establishing a full-fledged \u201cpeace agreement\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, bemoaning ceasefire agreements as unstable. At the same time, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table,\u201d though Russia has not agreed to stop fighting.",
      "In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump appeared to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, while emphasizing that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and its hopes of joining NATO \u2014 a key demand from Putin.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump said.",
      "A day earlier, Trump indicated in a post on Saturday that if talks with Zelenskyy are successful on Monday, he will facilitate further discussions with Putin in hopes of reaching a permanent end to the war.",
      "The meeting will give the leaders the opportunity to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be treaty-level obligations, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A GOP lawmaker who declined to be identified echoed the need for U.S. security guarantees.",
      "Similarly, a European official said that the meeting would be focused in part on clarifying what security guarantees would look like. Trump has floated land \u201cswapping,\u201d but the official said that their belief was that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls. Europe, the official said, would also likely want to participate in any final negotiations for a peace agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X late Sunday that he had arrived in Washington. \"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump,\" he said. He emphasized that \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started.\"",
      "The Ukrainian president\u2019s visit will be his first to the White House since a February meeting devolved into a stunning confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. The moment, which played out live on television, shocked Ukrainian allies and marked a sharp shift in the United States\u2019 years-long support for an ally embroiled in a bloody war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Monday\u2019s meeting comes after the White House welcomed Putin to Alaska, a controversial move that garnered further criticism when the U.S. rolled out a red carpet for Putin and took the controversial step of allowing the Russian autocrat to ride privately with Trump in \u201cThe Beast,\u201d a presidential vehicle.",
      "The meeting, which excluded Zelenskyy, ultimately concluded without a ceasefire deal. The leaders departed Alaska after hosting a 12-minute press event where they did not take questions or announce deliverables.",
      "Trump announced his meeting with Zelenskyy in the early hours of Saturday morning, adding in a post to Truth Social that \u201cif all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\u201d",
      "The future of major sticking points in discussions to end the war \u2014 the status of Ukrainian territories partially occupied by Russia and security guarantees to prevent a future Russian invasion \u2014 remained murky over the weekend.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that there \u201chave to be some security guarantees for Ukraine,\u201d noting that the issue would be discussed \u201cover the next few days.\u201d Witkoff said Sunday that security guarantees could resemble NATO\u2019s Article 5, which triggers a response by the entire coalition if one member is attacked.",
      "In an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Witkoff said that \u201cthe United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article 5 security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States and other European countries.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president celebrated what he called \u201ca historic decision\u201d for the U.S. to participate in security guarantees, saying in a post to X on Sunday that they \u201cmust really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe\u2019s participation.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy will also have the opportunity during Monday\u2019s meeting to address Trump\u2019s comments on the future of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia.",
      "In the days ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump said that an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying that \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "Rubio said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. But later that morning, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio\u2019s remarks when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Trump left his meeting with Putin without announcing any ceasefire or peace agreements. The president told reporters on his way to Alaska that \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy\u201d if the meeting did not lead to a ceasefire. He also said that Russia would face \u201ceconomically severe\u201d consequences if Putin did not seem interested in peace.",
      "However, Rubio said Sunday on \"Meet the Press\" that he did not believe \u201cnew sanctions on Russia are going to force him to accept the ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Witkoff defended the president after he failed to secure a ceasefire, saying on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that a ceasefire often precedes a peace deal, and \u201cthe president has always talked about a ceasefire until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ultimate deal here is a peace deal,\u201d Witkoff added.",
      "Trump\u2019s Friday meeting with Putin was a stark contrast from Zelenskyy\u2019s February trip to the White House, when Trump and Vance publicly berated Zelenskyy, arguing he was not grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy at the time. The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "The two leaders have met since then, though not at the White House. Trump and Zelenskyy met at the Vatican in April on the sidelines of the pope\u2019s funeral, and they met again privately at the NATO summit in June.",
      "Trump has previously falsely called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war. The war began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022."

      "A cohort of European leaders announced that they would join Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday as they seek to navigate America\u2019s new approach to ending the war.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced they would be joining Zelenskyy in D.C., perhaps hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office meeting.",
      "Trump signaled Saturday that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal \u2014 aligning the United States with the Kremlin rather than Kyiv and its European backers.",
      "Trump directly engaged with Zelenskyy and European leaders by phone early Saturday morning about the U.S. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News.",
      "\u201cEuropean and American security guarantees were discussed,\u201d one source familiar with the discussions said. \u201cU.S. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump].\u201d",
      "Security guarantees would activate in the scenario that Russia were to invade Ukraine again, the sources said, but the protections would not include NATO membership.",
      "'Meet the Press'",
      "A \u201cfull peace deal\u201d between Ukraine and Russia is the best chance to end the conflict, but a temporary ceasefire agreement is \u201cnot off the table,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "\u201cNow, whether there needs to be a ceasefire on the way there, well, we\u2019ve advocated for that,\u201d Rubio told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the Russians, as of now, have not agreed to that.\u201d",
      "Rubio defended the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to impose new sanctions on Russia as previously threatened, despite Putin\u2019s reluctance to move toward a peace deal, saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do right now is end the war.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think new sanctions on Russia are going to force them to accept ceasefire. They\u2019re already under very severe sanctions,\u201d he later added.",
      "The secretary of state also added that Putin is \u201ccertainly asking for things that the Ukrainians and others are not willing to be supportive of and that we\u2019re not going to push them to give, and the Ukrainians are asking for things that the Russians are not going to give up on.\u201d",

      "Three people were killed and another ten were injured in an overnight shooting involving multiple gunmen at a Brooklyn nightclub, police said.",
      "The shooting took place at the Taste of the City Lounge on Franklin Avenue in the Crown Heights neighborhood, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference. The victims were identified as a 27-year-old male, a 35-year-old male and an 19-year-old male.",
      "\u201cWhat we know preliminarily is that there was a dispute inside the crowded club that led to the shooting,\u201d Tisch told reporters. \u201cWe believe that there were up to four shooters involved in this incident.\u201d",

      "Air Canada suspends plans to restart flights as strike continues",
      "More than 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants walked off the job over pay and scheduling concerns, prompting the Canadian government to step in.",
      "The airline suspended all operations Saturday morning, before Jobs and Families Minister Patty Hajdu directed the Canada Industrial Relations Board to impose binding arbitration, effectively ordering workers to continue their regular duties until an agreement is reached.",
      "But on Sunday, the Canadian Union of Public Employees called the move \u201cblatantly unconstitutional\u201d and said its members \u201cremain on strike.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe demand a fair, negotiated contract and to be compensated for all hours worked,\u201d the union said in a statement.",
      "The airline subsequently suspended its plan to resume limited flights, and now expects to restart operations Monday evening.",
      "AI is coming for jobs \u2014 just not blue-collar ones, yet",
      "There is no shortage of hype around AI coming for jobs, and while the U.S. labor market has begun to sputter, hard evidence of AI-related job losses is scant. Even software engineers, seen as at particular risk thanks to AI\u2019s ability to generate computer code, so far seem relatively unscathed.",
      "Whether or not AI does end up replacing some jobs, experts predict that skilled trades that include manual labor and expertise are the least vulnerable to modern technology, and the idea has been enough to push some people to reconsider their futures.",
      "For Gen Zers without a degree, blue-collar work has offered a path to financial stability without the burden of student loans; and Gen Z men, regardless of education level, are more likely than women to choose blue-collar careers, according to a survey by Resume Builder.",
      "Those jobs, for now, appear safe. \u201cIt\u2019s a very wide misconception that we are on the verge of having humanoid robots basically replace workers. In my mind, that\u2019s a myth,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, president of the Robot Learning Foundation at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cProgress is being made at a slow pace.\u201d",

      "A Fulton County judge misspoke while reading a defendant\u2019s verdict in a Georgia courtroom, telling him he was guilty when the jury deemed him not guilty. The judge apologized, then re-read the statement correctly as people in the courtroom laughed and applauded.",

      "Hurricane Erin flexed back to Category 4 power and its defining 130 to 156 mph winds Sunday night after \"completing an eyewall replacement cycle,\" the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "The storm 130 miles east-northeast of Grand Turk Island spent the rest of Sunday as a Category 3 cyclone, pushing out winds of 125 mph. It was expected to strengthen by feeding off the warm tropical waters of the Atlantic north of the Caribbean Sea. It had started the weekend at the most powerful hurricane designation, Category 5.",
      "By late Sunday, Erin was back to pushing 130 mph sustained winds and stronger as it moved northwest at 12 mph, according to the hurricane center.",
      "\"Some additional strengthening is expected over the next 12 hours followed by gradual weakening,\" the center said in a late-night advisory. \"However, Erin is forecast to continue increasing in size and will remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.\"",
      "More than 50,000 utility customers were without power in Puerto Rico as the hurricane battered the Caribbean, bringing heavy rain, powerful wind and sizable waves to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.",
      "Luma Energy, Puerto Rico's private power grid operator, said Sunday night that most of its customers on the island had working electricity following \"multiple interruptions.\"",
      "\"As of 7:30 p.m., 95.1% of customers have electrical service,\" it said on X. \"The majority of affected customers are concentrated in the regions of Caguas, Mayag\u00fcez, and San Juan, as the rain bands have been moving out of Puerto Rico.\"",

      "It warned residents and visitors of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks to monitor the storm midweek.",
      "Officials in coastal Dare County declared a state of emergency effective Sunday evening and ordered the evacuation of Hatteras Island starting Monday morning.",

      "\"Extreme beach and coastal damage is likely along the oceanside, resulting in a significant threat to life and property,\" the agency said.",
      "On the island of Sint Maarten, video showed palm trees swaying in strong winds Saturday. Cleanup crews have been clearing debris around the country since Sunday morning, its government said on Facebook, adding that Sargassum seaweed has washed up ashore as a result of Erin\u2019s impacts. A large amount of the seaweed reaching the shore is referred to as a \u201cSargassum inundation event,\u201d which can result in harmful toxins that affect people and marine life, according to the National Ocean Service.",
      "Outer bands continue to sweep over Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rain and gusty wind. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with up to 6 inches likely in some areas, will be possible and could lead to flash flooding or mudslides.",

      "Video circulating on X showed heavy rain falling in Cidra in central Puerto Rico on Sunday. Other videos posted to social media showed trees swaying in the wind and storm waves on the island.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n said that there were no residents in shelters and no reports of flooding so far but that flash flooding remains a concern.",
      "The hurricane is forecast to strengthen in the next two days before taking a northerly turn on Monday and Tuesday. Its core is expected to pass by the east of Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas on Sunday night and Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is then forecast to gradually weaken through the middle and latter half of the workweek as it passes between the U.S. and Bermuda.",

      "Rubio\u2019s comments come days after President Donald Trump returned from Alaska, where he met for several hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a delegation of Russian leaders.",
      "The fact that neither Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy nor any representative from Ukraine were present for the discussions did not dim U.S. officials\u2019 hopes that they could push Putin toward a ceasefire agreement or a peace deal.",
      "After the Alaska meeting, however, the U.S. president told reporters, \u201cThere\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",
      "Later in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview, Rubio placed blame on Putin for not moving toward a ceasefire, responding to questions about Russia\u2019s continued strikes in Ukraine over the last few days.",
      "\u201cWe think usually it\u2019s very hard to negotiate when you\u2019re in the middle of hostilities. But that said, the only way to have a ceasefire is for both sides to agree to stop firing at one another ... and the Russians just haven\u2019t agreed to that,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy is headed to the White House on Monday to meet with Trump and other European leaders, including Finland\u2019s President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of a ceasefire for peace deal negotiations to continue at a joint news conference with von der Leyen in Brussels on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPutin has many demands, but we do not know all of them, and if there are really as many as we have heard about, then it will take a lot of time to go through all of them, and it is impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons,\" Zelenskyy told reporters. \"So it is necessary to stop the fire and work quickly on a final agreement. We will talk about this in Washington. Putin does not want to stop the killings, but he must do it.\u201d",
      "Rubio spoke Sunday more about the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to impose new sanctions on Russia, despite Putin\u2019s reluctance to move toward a peace deal, saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do right now is end the war.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re not going to be able to reach an agreement here at any point, then there are going to be consequences, not only the consequences of the war continuing, but the consequences of all those sanctions continuing, and potentially new sanctions on top of it as well. But what we\u2019re trying to do right now is end the war,\u201d Rubio told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think new sanctions on Russia are going to force them to accept ceasefire. They\u2019re already under very severe sanctions,\u201d he added later in the interview.",
      "Rubio also said the decision to impose new sanctions is incompatible with the fight for a lasting peace deal.",
      "\u201cThose options [for sanctions] remain to the president,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe minute he takes those steps, all talks stop. The minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians and try to get them to the table to reach a peace agreement. So that moment may come. I hope not, because I hope we get a peace deal.\u201d",
      "Though Rubio declined to provide insight into negotiations among Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and European allies, two points that have arisen publicly in recent weeks appear to be about territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere has to be talk about what the territories are going to look like and what the border lines are going to look like at the end of this conflict. There has to be talk about Ukraine\u2019s legitimate desire for security in the long term to make sure they don\u2019t get invaded again,\u201d Rubio said Sunday. \u201cThere has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that\u2019s been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are all key elements of any agreement. We understand that. And ... if there\u2019s going to be a deal, each side is going to have to give up on something,\u201d he added.",
      "Looking at a map of the territory in Ukraine that Russia has occupied, Rubio added, \u201cUltimately, if the Ukrainians are not willing to give that up, and no one\u2019s pushing Ukraine to give that up \u2014 and so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what \u2014 there\u2019s going to be a peace deal. It\u2019s not going to look like that.\u201d",
      "He added that Putin is \u201ccertainly asking for things that the Ukrainians and others are not willing to be supportive of and that we\u2019re not going to push them to give, and the Ukrainians are asking for things that the Russians are not going to give up on.\u201d",
      "Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, further detailed the discussions about territorial lines on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying five crucial regions are under discussion in peace deal negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere are five regions here that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s always in, in our view, been the crux of the deal,\u201d Witkoff told CNN without specifying what the five regions are beyond Donetsk.",
      "\u201cThe Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions,\u201d Witkoff added, saying the discussion will continue \u201con Monday, when President Zelenskyy arrives with his delegation and some of the other European leaders.\u201d",
      "Rubio also wouldn\u2019t comment on what the United States\u2019 role could look like in potential security guarantees, though Trump has maintained that a potential peace deal would not include a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO.",
      "NBC News previously reported that Trump spoke with Zelenskyy and European leaders over the phone early Saturday morning about a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine that includes the U.S. as part of a deal struck with Russia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ll have to be some security guarantees for Ukraine, right?\u201d Rubio said Sunday. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s one of their fundamental demands \u2014 is that if this war were to end, they have to make sure this never happens again.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn order for there [to] be a peace, the Russian side is going to have to accept that Ukraine is a sovereign country that has a right to defend itself and has a right to enter into alliances with other countries to defend itself. How that\u2019s constructed, what we call it, how it\u2019s built, what guarantees are built in there that are enforceable, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about over the next few days,\u201d the secretary of state added.",
      "Witkoff said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that security guarantees could be modeled of NATO's Article Five.",
      "\"It means that the United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article Five security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States and other European countries,\" Witkoff said, adding that was another point of discussion for Monday's meetings with Zelenskyy and other European leaders.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also appearing Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d slammed Rubio\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Putin in the first place.",
      "\u201cThat meeting was a disaster. It was an embarrassment for the United States. It was a failure. Putin got everything he wanted,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "\u201cTrump said, \u2018If I don\u2019t get a ceasefire, Putin is going to pay a price.\u2019 And then he walked out of that meeting saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t get a ceasefire. I didn\u2019t get a peace deal, and I\u2019m not even considering sanctions,\u2019\u201d Murphy added. \u201cYou heard Secretary Rubio downplay sanctions. And so Putin walks away with his photo-op with zero commitments made and zero consequences. What a great day for Russia.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn\u2019t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.",
      "Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.",
      "A mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.",
      "Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what\u2019s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest and beyond.",
      "The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.",
      "It's also caught people off guard.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn\u2019t really thrive in desert conditions, but it\u2019s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,\u201d said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "'A ticking time bomb'",
      "The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What\u2019s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cIn Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cIt just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.\u201d",
      "Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city\u2019s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.",
      "This year, the public health department hasn\u2019t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it\u2019s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.",
      "\u201cWe see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.\u201d",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.",
      "One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.",
      "The 'relentless biters' are spreading",
      "\u201cIn 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,\u201d said Raman, who oversees the health district\u2019s mosquito surveillance program. \u201cA few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it\u2019s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.\u201d",
      "In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.",
      "\u201cAedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,\u201d Raman said. \u201cThey are just relentless biters.\u201d",
      "Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child\u2019s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,\u201d Raman said. \u201cAll it takes is a couple inches of water.\u201d",
      "Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.",
      "Climate change is likely also a factor, and it\u2019s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.",
      "In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.",
      "\u201cLas Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we\u2019re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That\u2019s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.\u201d",
      "What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city \u2014 and thus controlling the public health risk \u2014 will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn\u2019t one in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don\u2019t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use \u2014 particularly around humans \u2014 and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.",
      "In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.\u201d"

      "Why were DermaRite hand soaps recalled?",

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says that Bcc is a group of bacteria most commonly found in dirt and soil. It can spread between people and cause lung infections. Those with compromised immune systems are particularly at risk when they come into contact with Bcc. The good news: DermaRite Industries says they have not received any reports of illness.",

The bookcase has adjustable shelves so you can move them around according to the height of your shoes \u2014 boots, for example, will need more space than a pair of sandals. But each shelf is only about 11 inches deep (about a size 11 in men\u2019s shoes or a women\u2019s 12), so make sure that works for your shoe collection. There are six shelves, and assuming you can place around three pairs of shoes per shelf, it should fit 18 pairs of shoes.

ClosetMaid specifically singles out any that measure smaller than 5.75 inches tall by 4.5 inches wide by 11 inches deep. The organizer comes in three colors: white, espresso and dark cherry.",
      "How to decide what shoe storage solution to buy",
      "Organize your shoesBefore buying any kind of shoe storage, McGreevy encourages a shoe cleanse: Categorize all of your shoes first and then place them side-by-side and decide whether to hold on to them, donate them or throw them away. \u201cGoing through this step is important so that you don\u2019t end up organizing extra pairs of shoes or buying more storage than you need,\u201d she said. \u201cCount how many pairs \u2014 and how many of each type \u2014 you have after decluttering. Purchase storage based on those numbers.\u201d",
      "Factor in shoe sizeAfter you assess which shoes need to go in the shoe case, look at your space as a whole. The type of shoe organizer you buy should also depend on the size of your space and how often you wear each pair, McGreevy said.",
      "Wear frequencySolomon agreed and added that the frequency at which you wear your favorite pairs is especially important when searching for shoe storage, since you won\u2019t want to tuck away shoes into individual storage bins if you plan on wearing them frequently. Instead, opt for open storage like a shoe cubby or shoe rack that allows for easy access, Solomon suggested. An over-the-door shoe bag could work for someone who doesn\u2019t need their collection in plain sight, she said. Plus, it frees up floor space.",
      "How to properly store shoes",
      "Generally, you should make sure you\u2019re storing shoes somewhere that isn\u2019t directly hit by sunlight but is well-ventilated and cleaned regularly, according to Meck. This can help prevent shoes from becoming damaged or collecting dust.",
      "For shoes that you want to pack away, Meck explained that wrapping them in tissue paper (and even old clothes) can keep them from scraping or scuffing together.",
      "For those shoes you reach for regularly, Solomon recommended leaving them around an entryway to prevent dirt from traveling further into your house or apartment.",
      "Here are a few other expert-recommended tips to consider when arranging your shoe storage:",
      "Boots: Both McGreevy and Solomon suggested using shapers in order to help maintain their shape and keep them standing straight. The two recommended this affordable option from The Container Store. For seasonal shoes like winter and rain boots, Solomon recommends the best place for storage is in an entryway closet or mudroom, especially if you don\u2019t want to drag in dirt from outside.Sneakers: Avoid sealed storage like storage bins for sneakers since these shoes need to breathe to look fresh and new, Solomon said. She\u2019s a fan of stocking sneakers in shoe cubbies, especially for someone who has a larger collection that they want to show off.Heels: Those who have a bigger selection of high heels should look between the shelves of a shoe shelf. Solomon recommended avoiding shoe racks with slats, as they \u201calways lead to heels getting stuck in between the rungs,\u201d or slanted shelves, as shoes tend to fall off the racks more easily.\u201d",

      "A new remittance tax set to begin in the new year has one university student reeling from the implications it will have for her family in Nigeria.",
      "Edidiong Chrys, a second-generation Nigerian American, said she thinks the 1% tax passed as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would directly affect the financial lifeline she sends overseas. This tax will be applied to anyone in the U.S. who sends money abroad.",
      "\u201cWe regularly send money home to support loved ones, including our elders, children in school, newborns and others in need,\u201d she said.",
      "Chrys, 38, said some of the funds sent home have gone to new parents in her family, helping ease the cost of food and traveling to doctors\u2019 appointments. The funds also help her uncle, who has a job but also must pay for his five daughters, who are all in school. He and his wife work, but it\u2019s still not enough \u201cto accommodate all the things that need to hold the household down,\u201d Chrys said.",
      "And then there\u2019s Chrys\u2019 80-year-old grandmother, who was weathering back pain when Chrys visited in January.",
      "\u201cWe are paying for the live-in nurse to help her during the week,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an additional expense that we need to have for her so that she\u2019s not bending over.\u201d",
      "The tax applies to anyone in the U.S. who sends remittances to their home countries. In 2023, remittances from the U.S. totaled $98 billion, according to the World Bank. Chrys contributes to the $56 billion in remittances sub-Saharan Africa received from people around the world last year. In fact, she said she regularly remits cash \u2014 more than 50 times a year \u2014 to family and friends.",
      "The Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on reducing global poverty through economic research, published an analysis last month that listed the tax as yet another financial setback for many nations, given the recent reduction in American aid.",
      "Liberia is highly dependent on foreign aid as well as remittances. In 2023, the U.S. accounted for a quarter of the country\u2019s foreign aid, and remittances surpassed Liberia\u2019s bilateral foreign aid by three times, according to the report.",
      "The African Union\u2019s outgoing ambassador to the United States, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, said hindering such funding \u201cthreatens to reverse gains in financial inclusion and development across the continent of Africa.\u201d",
      "Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow with the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Global Economy and Development program, said, \u201cTo put this tax on is just a further constraint on the U.S. effort to work with our partners on the continent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not transformational. ... It\u2019s just another obstacle to partnership, and it\u2019s another obstacle to development,\u201d he said.",
      "Schneidman, who also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration, condemned the Trump administration for building barriers and not bridges.",
      "\u201cWhen you add it up with the visa blockages, with the end of the [African Growth and Opportunity Act] AGOA, with the end of USAID, it\u2019s just building a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. is building a wall between itself and the world and certainly between itself and Africa.\u201d",
      "Suka-Mafudze, whose focus will turn toward the Southern African Development Community region, said that beyond hurting diplomatic ties, blocking remittances is also \u201ca human issue, because diaspora remittances are lifelines for millions of African families and these remittances often cover essentials, which are food, school fees, medical care and a lot of things. And to impose a tax on that is deeply unjust.\u201d",
      "Chrys said the financial burden of sending money home is already heavy, with some stretching limited resources to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cSome people are not making as much to be able to try to support their family back home,\u201d Chrys said. \u201cWhen I do get a chance to send money home, sometimes I\u2019m spending it from my refund check.\u201d",
      "Democratic Reps. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida and Jonathan L. Jackson of Illinois introduced new legislation called the African Diaspora Investment and Development Act, or AIDA, aimed at reversing the tax\u2019s impact. It would also create more transparency in money transfers, among other things.",
      "Suka-Mafudze backs the legislation, warning the new tax \u201ccould push people toward informal or unregulated channels, making transactions riskier and less transparent.\u201d",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian American member of Congress right now, warns that a remittance tax would unfairly burden families already struggling to support their loved ones overseas.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose any effort to tax remittances and will continue fighting for policies that protect immigrant and diaspora communities,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cH.R.4586 \u2014 AIDA intends to reverse course and instead focus on incentivizing and leveraging on the nearly 100 billion of dollars that Haitian, African and Caribbean Americans send home each year to build sustainable partnerships and strengthen economic development.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn\u2019t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.",
      "Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.",
      "A mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.",
      "Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what\u2019s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest and beyond.",
      "The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.",
      "It's also caught people off guard.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn\u2019t really thrive in desert conditions, but it\u2019s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,\u201d said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "'A ticking time bomb'",
      "The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What\u2019s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cIn Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cIt just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.\u201d",
      "Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city\u2019s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.",
      "This year, the public health department hasn\u2019t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it\u2019s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.",
      "\u201cWe see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.\u201d",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.",
      "One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.",
      "The 'relentless biters' are spreading",
      "\u201cIn 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,\u201d said Raman, who oversees the health district\u2019s mosquito surveillance program. \u201cA few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it\u2019s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.\u201d",
      "In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.",
      "\u201cAedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,\u201d Raman said. \u201cThey are just relentless biters.\u201d",
      "Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child\u2019s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,\u201d Raman said. \u201cAll it takes is a couple inches of water.\u201d",
      "Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.",
      "Climate change is likely also a factor, and it\u2019s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.",
      "In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.",
      "\u201cLas Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we\u2019re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That\u2019s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.\u201d",
      "What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city \u2014 and thus controlling the public health risk \u2014 will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn\u2019t one in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don\u2019t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use \u2014 particularly around humans \u2014 and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.",
      "In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.\u201d"

      "Jon Hamm\u2019s unwavering love for Bad Bunny continues, bringing the \u201cMad Men\u201d star all the way to Puerto Rico.",
      "The Puerto Rican rapper and singer has been in his home country for the past month to play a series of shows that are part of his first-ever concert residency, \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir de Aqu\u00ed.\u201d",
      "All the shows, which feature music from his sixth studio album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d are taking place at the Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan. So, fans, including many famous faces, have been traveling to the capital city to see Bad Bunny perform live.",
      "During his residency shows, the Grammy Award winner raps and sings his biggest hits from a series of stages, including one that doubles as a VIP area. Multiple A-list celebrities have been spotted in the section, like LeBron James, Ricky Martin and Austin Butler. At Bad Bunny\u2019s Aug. 16 concert, Hamm, a self-proclaimed huge fan of the \u201cMoscow Mule\u201d singer, was seen in multiple videos on social media having the time of his life at the show.",
      "In one video shared by TODAY\u2019s Editorial Director Arianna Davis on TikTok, the actor, who is wearing a black-and-white printed shirt, matching shorts and a white bucket hat, is seen dancing and singing along.",
      "Davis added text over the video that read, \u201cSeeing Jon Hamm vibing out at the Bad Bunny concert in Puerto Rico was not on my 2025 bingo card.\u201d",
      "In other videos, Hamm continues to enjoy his time in the spotlight and show off his moves.",
      "In another moment Davis captured, Bad Bunny went over to greet Hamm.",
      "The Emmy Award-winner previously gushed about being a Bad Bunny fan during his appearance on TODAY in April. During that same interview, he shared plans to make it to one of the rapper\u2019s residency shows.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re hoping to go to Puerto Rico. I\u2019m excited because he\u2019s doing this residency where he\u2019s doing a month and a half of shows in Puerto Rico,\u201d Hamm said of Bad Bunny. \u201cFirst of all, I think it\u2019s really cool that he\u2019s going back to his home, to really give back to the fans. He\u2019s reserving the first four, five or 10 shows, or whatever it is, for only residents of Puerto Rico, which is so cool.\u201d",
      "Hamm also spoke about appearing with Bad Bunny in a Q&A sketch during the \u201cSNL50\u201d special earlier this year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy. And he\u2019s funny. And he\u2019s fun and his music is awesome,\u201d Hamm praised. He also shared that Bad Bunny refers to him as \u201cJon Jam\u00f3n,\u201d the literal Spanish translation of his name.",
      "Hamm then further complimented the artist, continuing, \u201cYou can\u2019t listen to his music and not smile. I just love his story. He\u2019s a really nice guy. He\u2019s funny. He\u2019s an \u2018SNL\u2019 guy, too. They love him over there.\u201d"

    "summary": "When Taylor Swift appeared on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast Aug. 13 with the Kelce brothers, fans think she dropped hints at a Super Bowl halftime show performance.",
    "story": [
      "Hours before Taylor Swift\u2019s episode of \u201cNew Heights\u201d dropped, the songstress teased a special surprise for fans through her website.",
      "Accompanying a countdown the night of Aug. 13, a series of colored locks popped up at the bottom of the site. Dedicated Swift fans knew: Something was coming.",
      "The colored locks \u2014 orange, red, blue and silver \u2014 turned out to be deluxe editions of her previously announced 12th studio, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Many online users predicted this, and when 7 p.m. ET rolled around, they were proven right.",
      "Now, after listening closely, zooming in on Swift\u2019s background and crunching some numbers, fans think the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode has even more Easter eggs, which are subtle hints at her next big musical or career move.",
      "Swifties have since formulated a big theory: The international pop sensation will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "The halftime performer for the 2026 Super Bowl has not yet been announced, so all fan theories are pure speculation at this point. (For context, Kendrick Lamar was announced as the Apple Music Super Bowl 59 Halftime Show performer Sept. 8, 2024.)",
      "What we do know is that the 2026 Super Bowl marks the 60th NFL championship, and the game will be played at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Feb. 8, 2026. Levi's Stadium is home to the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Below, we break down three \u201cclues\u201d that some Swift fans are latching onto as they try to predict what\u2019s ahead for the singer.",
      "All That Sourdough Talk",
      "Swift\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode featured a rare look inside the singer\u2019s life. Speaking with the co-hosts \u2014 her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 she spilled on the beginning of her high-profile romance with the footballer, discussed the recent purchase of her master recordings and finally, previewed her upcoming 12th album.",
      "She also dished on her daily life outside of performing for millions, admitting that she has \u201cgranny\u201d hobbies, which, in her words, \u201ccould be categorized as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.\u201d",
      "Specifically, she was eager to talk about baking sourdough bread, and revealed some of the flavors she\u2019s made, including cinnamon swirl, blueberry lemon and Funfetti.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really talking about bread 60% of the time now,\u201d Swift said.",
      "Swift is know for being very intentional with her words and actions. For example: She teased that her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d would actually be a double album by pointedly holding up two fingers during her Grammys acceptance speech in February 2024. She subtly confirmed the Easter egg when she announced the double album on Instagram and included a peace sign emoji.",
      "In a similar vein, intrepid Swifties quickly connected a few dots from this sourdough conversation.",
      "They theorized that 60% might not have been a random number, and instead could have been a reference to Super Bowl 60. Plus, the mascot for the San Francisco 49ers, the home team of Super Bowl 60's Levi\u2019s Stadium, is none other than a gold miner named \u2026 Sourdough Sam.",
      "The official TikTok account for the 49ers has joined in on the fun. The team posted a TikTok amid the flurry of speculation, a video of Levi's Stadium's exterior set to the memorable line of dialogue from \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d \u201cWhat's going on here? Why is everyone acting weird towards me?\u201d",
      "\u201cweird that 4+9 is\u202613,\u201d one user commented on the post, referring to a number long associated with Swift.",
      "Crunching the Numbers",
      "In addition to a passing mention of 60%, Swifties also clocked a few other seemingly random numbers the singer mentioned during her two-hour \u201cNew Heights\u201d interview. At the start, she thanked Jason Kelce for his enthusiastic introduction, saying, \u201cThank you for screaming for, like, 47 seconds for me.\u201d",
      "Later in the episode, when asked how many countries she performed the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in, she answered: 47,000. (The actual answer is 21 countries.)",
      "Some fans dug into that number and realized that the 47th show of Swift\u2019s record-breaking \u201cEras Tour\u201d was at Levi\u2019s Stadium.",
      "They also pointed out that adding Swift\u2019s lucky number, 13 \u2014 the \u201cNew Heights\u201d episode fittingly dropped on Aug. 13 \u2014 to 47, they equal 60. Plus, the 2025-2026 NFL season will mark Swift\u2019s beau Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce\u2019s 13th season.",
      "To fans\u2019 credit, Swift said on the podcast that when it comes to planting an Easter egg, \u201cI love numerology. I love math stuff. I love dates.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life,\u201d Swift added. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be toward music or something I\u2019m coming up with, something I have coming up, a plan I have coming together \u2014 something that you don\u2019t know that I\u2019m saying for a specific reason that you\u2019ll hear later and you\u2019ll go back and be like, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019\u201d",
      "A Glimpse of a Super Bowl Trophy",
      "Then, there\u2019s the background of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. Swift and Travis Kelce recorded the podcast together and sat in front of a bookshelf that we already know was filled with Easter eggs.",
      "In the background, fans spotted four boxes in orange, red, blue and silver, labeled with \u201cT.S.\u201d on the front. Like the locks on the website, we now know those boxes represented the four deluxe editions of \u201cThe Life of the Showgirl.\u201d",
      "Also on the shelf? A statue resembling the iconic Vince Lombardi trophy, awarded to each year\u2019s Super Bowl champs. (An important note: Both Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce have won the Super Bowl with their respective NFL teams, so spying that trophy isn\u2019t necessarily out of the ordinary.)",
      "The trophy is positioned on the shelf on its side, which some fans argue could be a play on it being \u201chalfway,\u201d ergo, a wink at the halftime show.",
      "\u201cI want Easter eggs to be a certain thing, where if you are a part of the fandom and you want to experience music in a normal way, then you don\u2019t even see these,\u201d Swift said during the podcast. \u201cYou don\u2019t even care what that thing is above that doorway, under that dimly lit flickering light over there that\u2019s upside down in Braille. You don\u2019t need to know what that is.\u201d",
      "During that moment, some TikTok users slowed down the footage of Swift and think she may have pointing to the trophy and purposefully leaning to the side to put it in view."

      "Her surprise attendance came after weeks of speculation that the couple were dating.

      "In the first film, Hutch\u2019s seemingly domestic life unravels after two intruders break into his home. His decision not to fight back strains his marriage and leaves him questioning whom he has become. When a bus fight puts him up against Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov, Hutch enlists help from his father, David (Christopher Lloyd), and brother Harry (RZA) to take down Kuznetsov's crew. The film ends with Hutch and his family moving into a new home \u2014 but their return to normal appears to be short-lived when Hutch receives a phone call that suggests his assassin days aren\u2019t quite over yet.",

Hutch becomes Lendina's target after he meddles in her operation by saving the theme park operator's son, whom she had kidnapped, and burning down her massive fortune.",
      "Odenkirk calls the \u201clast third of the film ... a James Bond film, but with a family involved.\u201d It includes explosions, large-scale action sequences and an ending that circles back to Hutch\u2019s core conflict: protecting his family while accepting who he really is.",
      "In the end, Lendina and her crew are eliminated after a fiery and  intense battle that ultimately brings the family together following their harrowing experience.",
      "Does 'Nobody 2' Have a Post-Credits Scene?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d does not have a post-credits scene, but it does have a scene that plays at the beginning of the end-credits.",
      "While most end-credits and post-credits scenes help to wrap up any loose ends from the film or tease the next chapter in a franchise, the final scene in \u201cNobody 2\u201d only offers snapshots of what happened during the family's action-packed vacation in Plummerville. It includes pictures taken by Hutch's daughter that show various moments from their vacation and epic battle at the amusement park.",
      "Will There Be a 'Nobody 3'?",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Odenkirk says he would be down to do another \u201cNobody\u201d sequel, officially reprising his role of Hutch.",
      "\u201cI want a 'Nobody 3' and a 'Nobody 4,'\u201d he says. But, according to Odenkirk, there has yet to be an official conversation to get the ball rolling on it.",
      "\u201cIf the audience likes it \u2026 they decide, not us,\u201d he explains.",
      "On the date of publication, \u201cNobody 2\u201d has already scored a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 91% audience score.",
      "What Does Bob Odenkirk Say About 'Nobody 3'?",
      "Whether or not a third \u201cNobody\u201d film gets green-lit, Odenkirk already has a specific direction in mind. Just as \u201cNobody 2\u201d is set four years after the first film, he sees the next installment reflecting another time jump, four years after \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow those kids are older, Hutch really needs to reconnect before they split apart,\u201d he says of his on-screen children, Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) and Brady (Gage Munroe). In a potential third film, Odenkirk says his son would now be a 22-year-old adult, which could bring \u201canother level of trying to stay connected and a different set of tensions and challenges.\u201d",
      "Aside from all the action, Odenkirk says the balance of relatable family dynamics is at the heart of the series. \u201cThese films are meant to ... connect with our audience and connect this character on a common shared sense of family tension, and then let them become part of an action movie.\u201d",
      "He also says there could be space for Becca's backstory, which he revealed they filmed for \"Nobody 2.\"",
      "\"We know that backstory. In fact, we wrote it into \u2018Nobody 2,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t shoot it because we didn\u2019t have room in the story,\" Odenkirk tells TODAY.com. \"But we do know who Hutch and Becca are. We do know how they met, and we do know that they both know, if they cast their minds back to how they met, they both know that they are with a kick a-- spouse, and sometimes they forget that.\"",
      "\u201cNobody 2\" is a Universal Pictures film, which shares TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal."

David intends to thwart a merger at the company so he can buy the label and have complete control of the company he helped build.

David, with the self-described \u201cbest ears in the business,\u201d notices that one of the tracks features an artist with the same voice as the kidnapper.",

David, armed, goes into the studio alone and confronts Yung Felon. The young artist calls out David for not recognizing his talents sooner, blaming the exec for his lack of success in life.",

Yung Felon is arrested and publicly claims he is innocent as he arrives at a courthouse surrounded by supporters. Privately, he accepts a plea deal to go to prison for a couple decades. He also has a final request: to speak to David one more time.",
      "The two sit down, separated by a glass partition, for another sparring of words. Yung Felon says his popularity has caused his song to skyrocket on charts around the world. He says multiple labels are interested in him, but he wants David to sign him. David rebuffs his offer, revealing that he no longer works for Stackin\u2019 Hits Records and is starting a smaller, independent label. Yung Felon becomes enraged as he is dragged away by guards.",
      "In the final scene, David meets with a new artist named Sula (Aiyana-Lee), discovered by his son, who wants to be a star. She sings an original song for him, titled \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d before David promises to make her dream come true.",

      "Odenkirk\u2019s character, who was first introduced in the Bryan Cranston-led crime drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d received a spinoff series in 2015 that served as an origin story for Saul Goodman. It followed the Albuquerque, New Mexico criminal defense attorney, born Jimmy McGill, and his transformation from aspiring lawyer to the ambitious, and at times morally ambiguous, lawyer with ties to the criminal underworld.",
      "Created and executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the same team behind \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d ended with Odenkirk\u2019s character serving an 86-year prison sentence after confessing to his crimes, which included supporting Walter White (Cranston)\u2019s drug operation and acknowledging the role he played in his brother Howard\u2019s death.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s not getting out (of prison). If there\u2019s another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,\u201d he says emphatically, noting that the story would follow Saul's life behind bars.",

      "He's also aware of the strain it's put on him, telling The Hollywood Reporter that after years of playing Saul, in addition to his \u201cNobody\u201d character of Hutch, a highly-skilled assassin, he's \u201cfine with moving on\u201d from them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re guys who, for different reasons, have pretty big chips on their shoulders, and that\u2019s hard to play after a while,\u201d Odenkirk told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry that guy around all the time.\u201d",
      "But, Odenkirk reveals to TODAY.com, a \"Better Call Saul\" revival is not out of the question. The actor exclusively tells us what it would take for him to reprise his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d character and jump back into that universe.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. There are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.\u201d",
      "Though Odenkirk admits he would be up for the challenge, he feels it might be bit of a long shot.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says of a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d sequel or spinoff happening. \u201cI think they\u2019ve all moved on to some more amazing projects that you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d",
      "Odenkirk is referring to Gilligan\u2019s new Apple TV+ sci-fi drama called \u201cPluribus,\u201d which stars his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d co-star Rhea Seehorn.",
      "The series, which has already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+, is described as a \u201cpsychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque.\u201d Though official plot details have not yet been released, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com that the new show is \u201cgoing to be a great one.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook forward to the best written show on TV for years to come,\u201d he teases of the new series.",

      "Just over 24 hours later, Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to the hospital after she suffered cardiac arrest, the complaint states.",

Their tight, warm relationship is the one bright spot in Lynette\u2019s extremely challenging life.",

      "How Does \u2018Night Always Comes\u2019 End?",
      "Lynette tells Kenny she has to go away, but will come back to visit. After packing, she slips into her car (we\u2019d kind of hoped she\u2019d take her mom\u2019s brand-new vehicle, but that might get her into serious trouble).",
      "She leaves some money for Kenny and a note for her mother which reads in part, \u201cYou asked me what I did last night. I fought. I fought for this family. The only way I know how. But I guess you said what I needed to hear, so thank you. And now I need to fight for me.\u201d",

      "After 33 episodes (preceded by 94 episodes of \u201cSex and the City\u201d), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and their assorted pals and fashions closed the wardrobe doors on Aug. 14 with a lot of loose threads tying up, many still left open and so much pie being eaten.",
      "The announcement of \u201cAJLT\u2019s\u201d exit came only a few weeks ago, when renewal buzz was still in the air. As showrunner Michael Patrick King (who developed the follow-up series with \u201cSATC\u201d creator Darren Starr) wrote on Instagram Aug. 1, \u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 season three, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop.\u201d He noted that the last two episodes of the series were structured as more of a two-part finale (focusing around Miranda\u2019s challenging Thanksgiving party), but held off on calling it a finale.",
      "So how did things ultimately wrap up? Where do our leading ladies and men leave us? And just how did we go from Cosmos in clubs in the 1990s to pie in the kitchen in 2025? Let\u2019s examine the final episode, appropriately called \u201cParty of One.\u201d",
      "Are Carrie and Aidan Broken Up Forever?",
      "Considering that \u201cCadian\u201d broke up several episodes ago, that the first of the two-part finale was called \u201cForgot About the Boy,\u201d and the episode directly post-breakup skipped ahead to the fall without a reunion \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that Aidan (John Corbett) sealed his fate when he declared he still couldn\u2019t trust Carrie.",
      "Who\u2019s next for Carrie, then?",
      "Maybe no one.",
      "The final episode of \u201cAJLT\u201d focuses on Carrie coming up with a new perspective on what it means to be not just out of a relationship, not just with none on the horizon, but what it might mean to not necessarily want one.",
      "\u201cSeriously though, who will I be alone?\u201d she asks Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived alone without the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be alone for long.\u201d She confesses that after Big\u2019s death, she thought that Aidan might be her natural next step. Then she\u2019d considered Duncan as a possibility \u2014 but he left New York City, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Carrie picking up and following him.",
      "Then Carrie had her big revelation: \u201cI have to quit thinking, \u2018Maybe a man?\u2019 and start accepting maybe just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact, and I just have to start accepting it full stop.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a throwback to her new novel, whose original ending of a woman being happy being alone triggered her editor, leading to Carrie writing an epilogue in which love is a possibility for the single woman in the future. But in the end, post-Thanksgiving, Carrie returns to her apartment with leftover pie and rewrites the epilogue to read, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2014 she was on her own.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a solid period on the end of a sentence. The fact is, after many years of the story of Carrie, her friends and lovers, our heroine\u2019s longest-lasting relationship has not been with men. Or fashion. Or even her friends. Carrie\u2019s real love affair has been with herself, and her writing. It is the thing that gives her purpose and sets her apart from nearly everyone else she knows.",
      "What Happens to All the Other Characters?",
      "So where does that leave everyone else?",
      "With their loved ones, actually. As ever, the \u201cSex\u201d-iverse leaves everyone else as ancillary satellites circling Carrie\u2019s world, but we do get some insights as to where everyone else\u2019s mostly-happily-ever-after lives are heading next.",
      "Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) avoids her affair with her editor and comes home to a still-mourning Herbert (Christopher Jackson) and they promise to get through his political defeat together.",
      "Miranda and Joy (Dolly Wells) undergo a dog surgery and a particularly disgusting post-Thanksgiving bathroom disaster and end up embracing.",
      "Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) work around their differences in tradition and gluten, and have a pie-eating Thursday instead of a traditional Thanksgiving. But not before Carrie determines that the free spirit is in for the long haul with Seema.",
      "Brady (Niall Cunningham) and baby mama-to-be Mia (Ella Stiller, daughter of Ben) are far from reconciled, but Mia and her friends do make Miranda\u2019s Thanksgiving interesting, and Mia decides that Miranda is kind of cool after all.",
      "Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) discover there is life after prostate cancer surgery, and celebrate Thanksgiving with their children.",
      "Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) discuss Giuseppe\u2019s real intentions with Anthony. Guess they really are going to get married.",
      "Aidan is nowhere in sight.",
      "Is 'And Just Like That' Really Over?",
      "Was this a true finale \u2014 or will we see more of Carrie & Co. in the future?",
      "Too soon to tell. There are enough loose threads to create another spin-off. There\u2019s always a scenario where Carrie abandons her newfound sense of self and races off to the UK to chase Duncan. But let\u2019s face it, the end credits roll with a replay of the theme music to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d We think this is probably the end \u2014 for now.",
      "After all, Carrie has reached a point of acceptance of being alone, but not lonely. She has her friends and their offspring. She likes her home, even if it is a little too big. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave her in her beautiful red frock, dancing to Barry White\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the First, the Last, My Everything,\u201d eating pie direct from the pan with a spoon.",
      "It\u2019s as if the show is saying: This is not a tragedy. This is a victory.",
      "How wonderful, how wonderful, how wonderful."

      "Trump\u2019s sit-down with the leaders will come as he\u2019s intensified his efforts in recent weeks to end the war in Ukraine, a more than three-year conflict he insists would not have taken place had he been in office.",
      "Following his meeting with Putin, Trump shifted his aim toward establishing a full-fledged \u201cpeace agreement\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, bemoaning ceasefire agreements as unstable. At the same time, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table,\u201d though Russia has not agreed to stop fighting.",
      "In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump appeared to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, while emphasizing that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and its hopes of joining NATO \u2014 a key demand from Putin.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump said.",
      "A day earlier, Trump indicated in a post on Saturday that if talks with Zelenskyy are successful on Monday, he will facilitate further discussions with Putin in hopes of reaching a permanent end to the war.",
      "The meeting will give the leaders the opportunity to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be treaty-level obligations, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A GOP lawmaker who declined to be identified echoed the need for U.S. security guarantees.",
      "Similarly, a European official said that the meeting would be focused in part on clarifying what security guarantees would look like. Trump has floated land \u201cswapping,\u201d but the official said that their belief was that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls. Europe, the official said, would also likely want to participate in any final negotiations for a peace agreement.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X late Sunday that he had arrived in Washington. \"I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump,\" he said. He emphasized that \"Russia must end this war, which it itself started.\"",
      "The Ukrainian president\u2019s visit will be his first to the White House since a February meeting devolved into a stunning confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. The moment, which played out live on television, shocked Ukrainian allies and marked a sharp shift in the United States\u2019 years-long support for an ally embroiled in a bloody war that began with Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Monday\u2019s meeting comes after the White House welcomed Putin to Alaska, a controversial move that garnered further criticism when the U.S. rolled out a red carpet for Putin and took the controversial step of allowing the Russian autocrat to ride privately with Trump in \u201cThe Beast,\u201d a presidential vehicle.",
      "The meeting, which excluded Zelenskyy, ultimately concluded without a ceasefire deal. The leaders departed Alaska after hosting a 12-minute press event where they did not take questions or announce deliverables.",
      "Trump announced his meeting with Zelenskyy in the early hours of Saturday morning, adding in a post to Truth Social that \u201cif all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.\u201d",
      "The future of major sticking points in discussions to end the war \u2014 the status of Ukrainian territories partially occupied by Russia and security guarantees to prevent a future Russian invasion \u2014 remained murky over the weekend.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that there \u201chave to be some security guarantees for Ukraine,\u201d noting that the issue would be discussed \u201cover the next few days.\u201d Witkoff said Sunday that security guarantees could resemble NATO\u2019s Article 5, which triggers a response by the entire coalition if one member is attacked.",
      "In an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Witkoff said that \u201cthe United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article 5 security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States and other European countries.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president celebrated what he called \u201ca historic decision\u201d for the U.S. to participate in security guarantees, saying in a post to X on Sunday that they \u201cmust really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe\u2019s participation.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy will also have the opportunity during Monday\u2019s meeting to address Trump\u2019s comments on the future of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia.",
      "In the days ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump said that an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying that \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "Rubio said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. But later that morning, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio\u2019s remarks when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Trump left his meeting with Putin without announcing any ceasefire or peace agreements. The president told reporters on his way to Alaska that \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy\u201d if the meeting did not lead to a ceasefire. He also said that Russia would face \u201ceconomically severe\u201d consequences if Putin did not seem interested in peace.",
      "However, Rubio said Sunday on \"Meet the Press\" that he did not believe \u201cnew sanctions on Russia are going to force him to accept the ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Witkoff defended the president after he failed to secure a ceasefire, saying on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that a ceasefire often precedes a peace deal, and \u201cthe president has always talked about a ceasefire until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ultimate deal here is a peace deal,\u201d Witkoff added.",
      "Trump\u2019s Friday meeting with Putin was a stark contrast from Zelenskyy\u2019s February trip to the White House, when Trump and Vance publicly berated Zelenskyy, arguing he was not grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy at the time. The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "The two leaders have met since then, though not at the White House. Trump and Zelenskyy met at the Vatican in April on the sidelines of the pope\u2019s funeral, and they met again privately at the NATO summit in June.",
      "Trump has previously falsely called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war. The war began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",
      "\u201cHilariously bad, oddly addictive,\u201d reads one IMDb review of the show, which had more than 485 million views on ReelShort as of Friday.",
      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

      "It centers on Andrew\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and covers his finances and dealings with foreign governments, as well as the timeline of his ties with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the late financier and convicted sex offender who has been the subject of fervent attention in both Britain and the United States in recent weeks.",
      "NBC royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said Thursday that the good news for Andrew and the royal family may be that the impact of this renewed focus will be blunted by the reality that his reputation is already at \u201crock bottom.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible other people might well be taking some of the heat off Andrew,\u201d she said, referring to politicians in the U.S.",
      "Publisher HarperCollins says Lownie, a historian, drew on four years of research and interviews with more than 100 people who haven\u2019t spoken before in writing the 448-page book. The majority spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Excerpts have been splashed across Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, and a poll released this week found that two-thirds of Britons want the disgraced younger brother of King Charles III to be stripped of his remaining royal titles.",
      "An earlier YouGov survey found Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with just 5% of respondents saying they held a positive view of him.",
      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, was one place above Andrew, at 20%, with heir to the throne Prince William topping the rankings on 74%.",
      "A representative for Andrew and Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about both the book and the polling.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died by suicide in April this year, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court ruled that Andrew had been \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with Yang Tengbo as it lifted an anonymity order protecting Tengbo's identity. Tengbo had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K.",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "His public standing has remained little changed since a disastrous interview about his ties to Epstein on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d program in November 2019.",
      "Despite this simmering anger and growing pressure, McAndrew said she doesn't think the king will take the drastic step of removing Andrew's royal titles. But, she said, William might act differently when he ascends the throne.",
      "\"He\u2019s much less sentimental as a personality. And the royal family (and future monarch peculiarly) ultimately must exist to protect the monarchy,\" she said.",
      "The royal family will have to consider whether taking new action against Andrew could run the risk of him retaliating publicly. They may feel it is better, McAndrew said, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\""

      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",

      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",

      "\u201cOf course, we would all like for all of this to end and end, at least, without any major catastrophes,\u201d she said.",
      "It is hard to get an accurate sense of the weight of public opinion in Russia as a result of Putin\u2019s yearslong crackdown on dissent, which has stifled political opposition and free speech.",
      "A recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for Putin's military campaign in Ukraine remained high at 75% in Russia, but that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported peace talks.",
      "The venue for those talks is itself significant.",
      "Trump and Putin will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a  military base that was crucial to U.S. efforts to counter the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "It sits just outside Anchorage, the largest city in the territory,   which the U.S. bought from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 \u2014 a sale that has since been viewed as na\u00efve by Russians after Alaska was found to contain vast natural resources.",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov signaled Thursday that while the primary focus of the summit would be Ukraine, economic ties between the two nations would also be on the agenda. Putin hinted that a nuclear arms control treaty may also be discussed.",
      "Ukraine and its allies may fear Putin offering Trump other incentives to distract from his hard-line position on the war he launched by invading his neighbor.",
      "\u201cStripped of political narratives and competing interests, and based on Putin\u2019s own statements and actions, his core demands have not changed,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank.",
      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Stanovaya added that she thought Putin intended to \u201cpropose to Trump that the war be brought to an end, and will press the point that he genuinely wishes it to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis main objective is to persuade Trump that Europe and the current Ukrainian leadership are the obstacles to ending the conflict, and that a cessation of hostilities is possible if there are guarantees that Ukraine will not use any pause to rearm,\u201d she said on X, adding that the Russian president \u201cwill strongly promote the idea that the U.S. and Russia are two great nations that should maintain good relations regardless of local conflicts.\u201d",
      "In Moscow, Ionova, the opera singer, said she hoped \u201ceverything will be fine,\u201d adding, \u201cWe wish that this summit will be successful for us, for Russia.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "KHARKIV, Ukraine \u2014 Even as his family sobbed into the dirt of his brother\u2019s grave, Ukrainian soldier Artem Reshetilov warned President Donald Trump that he should not compromise with Russia during Friday\u2019s peace talks in Alaska.",
      "His brother, Andrei, 38, was killed by a Russian artillery strike while fighting to defend Ukraine\u2019s front lines. At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage \u2014 which Ukraine has not been invited to \u2014 Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands of more Ukrainian land.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv.",
      "Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to \u201creturn even stronger\u201d and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe know Russia and they never keep agreements,\u201d he added.",
      "These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree to with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours.",
      "Hours before the talks Friday, Trump suggested that he and Putin would discuss territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 despite previously assuring European allies that he wouldn\u2019t. But Trump said that \"I've got to let Ukraine make that decision\" and that his aim was to set up future talks between the two warring neighbors.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump said that he would not deal economically with Russia until the war was over. He also said it was possible Ukraine could emerge from negotiations with their much desired \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d against Russia attacking again.",
      "If Russia does not agree to peace the consequences \u201cwill be very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for my health. I\u2019d like to focus on our country, but I\u2019m doing this to save a lot of lives.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "Alarmed at being frozen out of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government this week turned to European leaders for a lifeline, hoping to influence the high-stakes summit and prevent a potential disaster for Ukraine.",
      "A flurry of diplomacy culminated Wednesday with an emergency video call between Trump, Zelenskyy and leaders from Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and NATO, all of whom urged the American president not to capitulate to Putin. Trump said afterward that he had assured them there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin did not agree to end the war.",
      "U.S. allies came away hopeful they had steered the president away from a potential Putin diplomatic trap, but nonetheless remain anxious, European diplomats and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s looking better today than it did a week ago,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians and the Europeans were all worried that Trump and Putin would get together and make some decisions for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Even so, the apprehension is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe all are preparing ourselves for an outcome that may be highly problematic,\u201d said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "So far, Ukrainian officials and European allies have tried to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Trump. But if the talks produce a lop-sided proposal favoring Russia, \u201cthen there is no way that Europe can simply pretend that everything is simply OK,\u201d the European official said.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News to statements Trump has made this week saying that it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to make a deal and that this meeting was merely a \u201clistening exercise\u201d that could lead to an eventual summit between the warring leaders.",
      "What\u2019s caused the most consternation in Ukraine is Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that he could negotiate a \u201cland swap\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, having previously suggested it would be unrealistic for Ukrainians to expect the return of lands illegally invaded and currently occupied by Russia.",
      "The American president told European leaders this week that he would not discuss territory divisions during his sit-down with Putin, two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News.",
      "That\u2019s not to say opinion in Ukraine hasn\u2019t shifted. A survey by pollster Gallup this month suggested the public  now favors a negotiated solution \u2014 though the majority still reject Russia\u2019s absolutist terms.",
      "Regardless of what Trump and Putin discuss, Ukraine\u2019s absence renders the entire exercise absurd and insulting for many in the country actually under attack.",
      "\u201cWhy should they talk about Ukraine without Ukraine\u2019s participation?\u201d said Oksana Andrusyak, 26, who works as a communications analyst in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.",
      "She expects such from Putin, a man wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. \u201cBut why does the United States, which positions itself as a state that values the rule of law,\u201d want to take part in what she calls a \u201ccircus\u201d?",
      "Putin has said he is ready for peace \u2014 but only if Ukraine essentially surrenders. Rather than showing willingness to wind up his war, he is killing more Ukrainian citizens than ever.",
      "There were more civilian casualties in July than in any other month of the war \u2014 286 people killed and 1,388 injured \u2014 the United Nations announced last month."

    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cdo everything I can to save\u201d the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities.",
      "Closing arguments in the landmark trial, which began in December 2023, were set to begin this week after a five-month break following the end of Lai\u2019s testimony in March. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",
      "\u201cI hope his family can stay strong and bold,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWe support him.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with  Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call.",
      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",
      "Vance said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "A man accused of faking his own death and fleeing the United States to avoid sexual assault allegations was convicted of rape in Utah on Wednesday, prosecutors said.",
      "A Salt Lake County jury found Nicholas Alahverdian, who has been identified and charged by authorities in Utah as Nicholas Rossi, guilty after three days of testimony. Deliberations began on Wednesday.",
      "He will be sentenced on Oct. 20, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office said. He faces five years to life in prison.",
      "\"We are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\" Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a statement. \"We appreciate her patience as we worked to bring the defendant back to Salt Lake County so that this trial could take place and she could get justice. It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Alahverdian's defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Alahverdian faces a second rape trial in nearby Utah County scheduled for September.",
      "In 2022 \u2014 two years after an online obituary stated that Alahverdian died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2014 Alahverdian was arrested in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight.",
      "Speaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair, he denied that he was Alahverdian and claimed that he was an Irish orphan who had become a businessman.",
      "In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the Salt Lake County case said that Alahverdian admitted his true identity under oath last year. He accused Alahverdian of raping a 24-year-old woman in 2008 after a whirlwind romance and engagement.",
      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",
      "Alahverdian\u2019s defense lawyer, MacKenzie Potter, compared the allegations to an \u201cold puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d saying that \u201cnot all the pieces are there.\u201d",
      "The victim\u2019s story had changed over time, Potter said, and it can\u2019t be verified.",
      "Alahverdian, who was raised in Rhode Island\u2019s foster youth system and later became an outspoken aide in that state\u2019s legislature, was previously accused or convicted in other assault and sex crimes cases involving women with whom he was in relationships.",
      "In a case in Massachusetts in 2010, a woman he was married to at the time told authorities he held her down, grabbed her neck, struck her in the face, and refused to let her leave their home following an argument over a crying baby.",
      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

      "The White House is yet to comment, but ahead of the talks Trump described his European colleagues as \u201cgreat people who want to see a deal done\u201d in a Truth Social post.",
      "Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this land grab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow\u2019s former Soviet vassals. Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine. They argue Ukraine must have \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d perhaps in the form of Western peacekeepers, so the Kremlin does not use the pause to regroup and attack again."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
