      "A hearing where a Minnesota man was expected to plead guilty to hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d has been postponed indefinitely because he's hospitalized",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A hearing where a Minnesota man was expected to plead guilty to hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was postponed indefinitely Wednesday after his attorney told the court that the man is hospitalized.",
      "U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the continuance at the request of the attorney for Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who was planning to change his plea to guilty at a hearing that was scheduled for this coming Friday.",
      "Defense lawyer John Brink said Saliterman was hospitalized Jan. 3 \u201cfor inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He wrote that Saliterman remained hospitalized Wednesday and that doctors do not know when he will be available. Federal prosecutors did not object.",
      "Saliterman attended his arraignment Monday via video from what looked like a hospital room. He was in a wheelchair and on supplemental oxygen last March at his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million last month, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The man who stole them, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, of Grand Rapids, pleaded guilty in 2023. He was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health."

      "The untelevised but starry NBR Awards were a chance for many of the nominees who didn\u2019t win Sunday to trot out their would-be acceptance speeches, including Daniel Craig, Kieran Culkin and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Accepting the award for best actress for her performance in the erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl,\u201d Kidman celebrated by chugging a glass of milk, a nod to some of the film's kinky sex games. After finishing, Kidman triumphantly announced \u201cGood girl!\" and left the stage.",
      "It also was an opportunity for some jabs at the Globes. \u201cIsn\u2019t this room just a little bit classier than the Beverly Hilton?\u201c quipped presenter Christine Baranski, looking around the elegant marble-columned midtown venue, Cipriani\u2019s.",

      "The night belonged to Jon M. Chu's \u201cWicked.\u201d The musical was the board's pick for best film, best director for Chu and a special award for the creative collaboration of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "Writer-director Jeff Baena, who was actor and producer Aubrey Plaza's husband, has died at age 47",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Writer-director Jeff Baena, whose darkly comedic independent films included \u201cThe Little Hours\u201d and who was married to his frequent creative collaborator Aubrey Plaza, has died. He was 47.",
      "Baena was found dead Friday morning at a Los Angeles home, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office. The circumstances of his death remained unclear Saturday, and the office said it was investigating and a full report would not be available until the case is closed.",
      "Baena co-wrote David O. Russell's 2004 film \u201cI Heart Huckabees\u201d and wrote and directed five of his own films, four of which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "He had been dating Plaza for three years before she starred in his 2014 directorial debut, the zombie comedy \u201cLife After Beth.\" His next film, 2016's \u201cJoshy,\u201d featured Thomas Middleditch as a man who gets together with friends months after his fiancee commits suicide.",
      "The son of an attorney and teacher, Baena grew up in Miami and attended film school at New York University. He told podcaster Marc Maron in a 2017 interview that his interest in cinema was sparked after watching Stanley Kubrick's \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and Federico Fellini's \u201c8 1/2\u201d as a child.",
      "\u201cI was always drawn to left-of-center things,\u201d he told Jim Alexander two years ago in an interview for the Reel Talker YouTube channel.",
      "Baena said in the same interview that it was \u201camazing\u201d to work with Plaza, who appeared in four of his five films. The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

      "Viola Davis and Ted Danson have been celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence",
      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills.",
      "Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles.",
      "\u201cIf I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn\u2019t be standing up here,\u201d said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.",
      "Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds. It\u2019s the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards.",
      "Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a \u201cdark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I took it for the money,\u201d said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as \"Fences,\"\u201cThe Woman King,\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,\u201d she said. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any nobility in poverty.\u201d",
      "Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who \u201cdelivers the truth every time.\u201d Both actors worked together in the 2008 film \u201cDoubt,\u201d where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her \u201cfavorite actor in the world.\u201d",
      "The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood\u2019s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.",

      "Danson currently stars in Netflix\u2019s \u201cA Man on the Inside,\u201d which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.",
      "\u201cBia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: \u2018Ted sets the tone,\u2019\u201d said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",
      "Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including \u201cPontiac Moon,\u201d \u201cGulliver's Travels\u201d and \u201cIt Must Be Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness,\u201d Steenburgen said. \u201cAs his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud.\u201d",
      "Danson traded \u201cI love you\u201d with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the \u201cCheers\u201d co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event.",

      "\u201cShe's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress,\u201d said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir \u201cFinding Me.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel \u2018purty'\" she continued. \"What she's whispering is: \u2018I told you I was a magician.\u2019\u201d",

He parked the souped-up golf cart and tossed the keys ZZ Top-style ahead of the first day of his new job.",
      "He then dropped a profanity into the start of his monologue.",
      "Roll out The Chug Machine, fly, F-bombs, fly and save a seat for Sir Charles because the latest host crashing late-night television is a bit more raw than the traditional suit-and-tie joke tellers.",

      "Here's Kelce!",
      "\u201cI used to love watching late-night TV growing up,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce quickly proved there\u2019s space for another JK in late night \u2014 Kelce disappeared into a portal where he walked out into (a pantsless) Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s office to ask for hosting advice \u2014 and moderated a loose panel of sports topics with guests Charles Barkley, rapper and actor Lil Dicky, and NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger.",
      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",
      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",

      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows.

Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",

      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",

      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",

      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",

      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",

      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",

      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "In late September, Hurricane Helene damaged a major supplier of intravenous (IV) fluids. In this report, we follow up on what has happened since.",
      "Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented and catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, damaging a Baxter manufacturing site that was a major supplier of IV fluids. Hospitals across the country continue to grapple with the ensuing shortage of critical supplies.",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller also fired back, dismissing Trump's comments as \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "\"There is no chance of us becoming the 51st state. I think that this is beneath a president of the United States,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI said a few weeks ago that this whole thing was like a South Park episode.\"",
      "Trump refused to rule out acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal by military force and has said the U.S doesn't need anything from Canada, including automobiles, lumber and dairy products.",

      "The U.S. imports approximately 60% of its crude oil from Canada, with Alberta alone supplying 4.3 million barrels per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels a day, while domestically producing about 13.2 million barrels a day. This means about quarter of the oil the U.S. consumes every day is from Canada.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Ford said Canada will retaliate if Trump imposes tariffs, saying that a wide range of U.S. products shipped to Canada will be targeted, but he declined to specify which ones.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said she never takes Trump's threats lightly.",
      "\"At the same time we can\u2019t take the bait,\u201d Joly said. \u201cWe have to show we have a strong economy and we are strong and we are not going to be annexed.\u201d"

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has responded sarcastically to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "Standing before a global map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \u201cAm\u00e9rica Mexicana,\u201d or \u201cMexican America,\u201d because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice, no?\u201d she added with a sarcastic tone. She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.",
      "The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: How would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump's strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left \u2013 was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under U.S. pressure, a boon to Trump.",
      "But it was unclear if Mexico's first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed L\u00f3pez Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.",
      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\u201cHumor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\u201d said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \u201cAlthough President Sheinbaum knows it won\u2019t work on everything \u2014 Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \u201cnot acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\u201d",
      "She's taken a more concessionary tone on immigration, falling in line with years of Mexican efforts to block migrants from traveling north amid mounting pressure by the U.S.",
      "After originally saying her government would push the Trump administration to deport migrants directly back to their own countries, in January she said Mexico would be open to accepting deportees from other countries, but Mexico could limit it to certain nationalities or request compensation."

      "The stakes for Friday\u2019s swearing-in of the man who will govern Venezuela for the next six years have never been higher in this century.",

      "But Gonz\u00e1lez has paid the price for challenging the 25-year rule of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Under pressure, he has gone into exile. And on Tuesday, he said son-in-law Rafael Tudares had been kidnapped in the capital, Caracas.",
      "\u201cAt what point did being related to Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia become a crime?\u201d his daughter, Mariana Gonz\u00e1lez de Tudares, said in a statement that suggested the government was behind her husband\u2019s disappearance.",
      "The coalition of main opposition parties, in a statement, characterized it as a \u201cforced disappearance for political reasons.\u201d The government\u2019s centralized press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, had been enjoying retirement after a career as a diplomat when the coalition selected him in April as a last-minute stand-in for opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado. She had been blocked by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice from running for office after she swept the opposition\u2019s October 2023 primary with more than 90% of the vote.",

We are here to celebrate and strengthen democracy and hand over to the Brazilian people their fully restored heritage,\u201d said Brazil\u2019s first lady, Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, known as Janja, as she opened the ceremony at the presidential Palace.",
      "On Jan. 8, 2023, thousands of pro-Bolsonaro rioters bypassed security barricades around the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Court, and climbed onto roofs, smashed windows, urinated on precious art and damaged historic Brazilian memorabilia. They invaded government buildings and called for a military intervention to remove Lula from office.",
      "Artworks that were destroyed have been restored, in partnership with Swiss authorities, and are being reintroduced to the public, Brazil\u2019s presidency said. Lula had invited the president of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, and the lower house speaker, Arthur Lira, but neither participated in the ceremony.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court is scheduled to host discussions with staffers who witnessed the court's invasion and others who took part in reconstruction efforts. A remembrance website is being set up and an exhibition of art produced using wreckage from the melee will be opened.",

      "Federal Police have formally accused Bolsonaro and 36 others, including high-ranking military officers, of attempting a coup. The accusation is sealed, but the authorities had been investigating whether he incited the Jan. 8 uprising.",
      "The former leader is an outspoken admirer of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and the riot in Brasilia offered an echo of the Capitol insurrection in Washington in January 2021.",
      "Legal experts believe Bolsonaro could be charged and stand trial in the second of half of 2025 at the Supreme Court for allegedly falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status. Analysts also say there\u2019s a reasonable chance he stands trial before 2026 over allegedly embezzling jewels gifted by Saudi Arabian authorities.",

      "His supporters have focused most of their anger at the Supreme Court, particularly Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is presiding over several investigations targeting them. He publicly warned Brazilians last year that any celebration of Jan. 8 would constitute a crime.",
      "According to a Supreme Court report released Tuesday, 898 people have so far been held criminally responsible for the Jan. 8 uprising, with 371 convicted and the remainder signing leniency agreements. The report notes 485 additional investigations are ongoing.",

      "PARACHINAR, Pakistan -- Aid trucks carrying medicines, food and other relief supplies for hundreds of thousands of besieged residents reached a remote region in restive northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, a government spokesman and local officials said.",
      "A key highway leading to the Kurram district was closed by authorities over three months ago following violent clashes between rival Shiite and Sunni tribes in which at least 130 people have died.",
      "The convoy had been waiting for a security clearance since Saturday when gunmen opened fire on government vehicles and wounded some officials who were on their way to supervise the supply of aid to Kurram, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.",
      "Muhammad Ali Saif, a spokesman for the provincial government, said Wednesday that dozens of trucks and vehicles carrying food, medicines, tents and other essential items, have reached the Kurram district.",
      "The latest development comes two weeks after authorities with the help from elders secured a ceasefire in Kurram.",
      "Road closures had disrupted the local population\u2019s access to medicine, food, fuel, education and work since October, but violence flared on Nov. 21, when gunmen ambushed a convoy of vehicles and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims, in a dispute over land.",
      "Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant Sunni groups previously targeting minority Shiites."

      "Egypt has unveiled several discoveries near the famed city of Luxor including ancient rock-cut tombs and burial shafts dating back 3,600 years",
      "CAIRO -- Egypt unveiled several discoveries near the famed city of Luxor on Wednesday, including ancient rock-cut tombs and burial shafts dating back 3,600 years.",
      "They were unearthed at the causeway of Queen Hatshepsut\u2019s funerary temple at Deir al-Bahri on the Nile\u2019s West Bank, according to a statement released by Zahi Hawass Foundation for Antiquities & Heritage. It said it worked in tandem with the Supreme Council of Antiquities on the site since September 2022.",
      "Artifacts found at the tombs included bronze coins with the image of Alexander the Great dating to the Time of Ptolemy I (367-283), children\u2019s toys made of clay, cartonnage and funerary masks that covered mummies, winged scarabs, beads and funerary amulets.",
      "Hawass told reporters that the discoveries could \u201creconstruct history\u201d and offer an understanding of the type of programs ancient Egyptians designed inside a temple.",
      "The archaeologists also found the remains of Queen Hatshepsut\u2019s Valley Temple, rock-cut tombs dating back to the Middle Kingdom (1938 B.C. - 1630 B.C.), burial shafts from the 17th dynasty, the tomb of Djehuti-Mes and part of the Assassif Ptolemaic Necropolis.",
      "The rock-cut tombs had been previously robbed during the Ptolemaic period and later. Still, the Egyptian teams uncovered some artifacts such as pottery tables that were used to offer bread, wine and meat.",
      "Inside the burial shafts dating back to 1580 B.C. - 1550 B.C., anthropoid wooden coffins were found, including one that belonged to a young child. It remained intact since its burial some 3,600 years ago. War archery bows were also found inside the burial chamber, indicating that those who owned the tombs had military backgrounds and fought to liberate Egypt from the Hyksos.",
      "Not many artifacts from Djehuti Mes\u2019s tomb were found, but the tomb itself reveals more about Djehuti Mes, who oversaw Queen Teti Sheri\u2019s palace. The date engraved on the Djehuti Mes\u2019 funerary stelae indicates that the tomb goes back to the 9th year of King Ahmose I\u2019s reign (1550 B.C. - 1525 B.C.).",
      "Part of the extended Ptolemaic necropolis that occupied the site of the causeway and the Valley Temple was also uncovered. The tombs in the cemetery were built of mud bricks over the remains of Queen Hatshepsut\u2019s temple. A large part of the necropolis was unearthed earlier in the 20th century but wasn\u2019t properly documented.",
      "In November, Egyptian and American archaeologists  excavated an ancient tomb with 11 sealed burials near Luxor. The tomb, which dates to the Middle Kingdom, was found in the South Asasif necropolis, next to the Temple of Hatshepsut.",

      "Borno has been the center of extremist violence in Nigeria since the Boko Haram extremist group launched an insurgency in 2009 to enforce their interpretation of Shariah law. The insurgency, which has spilled over to Nigeria's three neighbors in the Lake Chad region, has killed more than 35,000 people and displaced 2.6 million others.",
      "The latest attack occurred Sunday in Sabon Gari village in the Damboa council area, a hot spot that has been mostly deserted by residents. \u201cThe terrorists had attempted to surprise troops and retaliate against the recent killing of their commander and combatants by troops,\u201d Buba said.",
      "The attack was seen as a setback for the Nigerian military, which often claims the rebels have been \u201cdegraded.\u201d Despite such claims, deadly ambushes and suicide bombings have continued in the last year.",
      "Ending the war has been challenging because of a lack of political will and the ability of the extremists to operate freely across the borders with Nigeira\u2019s northern neighbors, said Senator Iroegbu, an Abuja-based security analyst.",
      "He said the military has also struggled to obtain \"accurate and timely intelligence on Boko Haram\u2019s movements and plans.\u201d",

      "Russian officials acknowledged a major drone attack in the area, and said that authorities had set up an emergency command center to fight the fire.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff said that the assault hit the storage facility near Engels, in Russia\u2019s Saratov region, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. The depot supplied a nearby airfield used by aircraft that launch missiles across the border into Ukraine, a statement on Facebook said.",
      "Ukraine has been developing its arsenal of domestically produced long-range missiles and drones capable of reaching deep behind the front line as it faces restrictions on the range that its military can fire its Western-supplied missiles into Russia.",
      "The attacks have disrupted Russian logistics in the almost three-year war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last year that his country has developed a weapon that could hit a target 700 kilometers (400 miles) away. Some Ukrainian drone attacks have hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) away.",
      "The governor of the Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said that an unspecified industrial plant in Engels sustained damage from the falling drone debris that sparked a fire, but nobody was hurt.",
      "Engels, which has a population of more than 220,000, is located on the left bank of the Volga River, and is home to multiple industrial plants. Saratov, a major industrial city of about 900,000, faces Engels across the river.",

      "The main base of Russia\u2019s nuclear-capable strategic bombers is located just outside Engels. It has come under Ukrainian drone attacks since the early stages of the war, forcing the Russian military to relocate most of the bombers to other areas.",

      "LONDON -- British police watchdogs will investigate whether the London force bungled its handling of sex crimes allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, the late owner of upmarket department store Harrods.",
      "The Independent Office for Police Conduct said Wednesday that it will oversee a probe by the Metropolitan Police Directorate of Professional Standards into whether opportunities were missed to bring the wealthy businessman to justice.",
      "\u201cThere is widespread public concern around this case, with a significant number of allegations reported over many years while Mr. Al Fayed was still alive,\u201d said Steve Noonan, director of operations at the conduct watchdog. \u201cIt\u2019s important that an investigation is carried out into these complaints to identify if there were any missed opportunities or failures by officers to properly investigate these reports made back in 2008.\u201d",
      "Since the BBC broadcast claims by several former Harrods employees in September, police have been reviewing multiple allegations of rape or sexual assault against Al Fayed, who died in 2023 at the age of 94. The Metropolitan Police is currently reviewing 21 allegations that were made before Al Fayed died, and in total more than 100 women have contacted police to say they were sexually abused by the tycoon.",
      "Police and Harrods executives have faced questions about why action wasn\u2019t taken against Al Fayed while he was alive. He was questioned by detectives in 2008 over the alleged sexual abuse of a 15-year-old, and police twice passed files of evidence about him to prosecutors. He was never charged.",
      "The Egypt-born businessman moved to Britain in the 1960s and bought Harrods, a London landmark, in the mid-1980s. He became a well-known figure through his ownership of the store and the London soccer team Fulham. He was often in the headlines after his son Dodi was killed alongside Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997.",
      "Al Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to a company owned by the state of Qatar through its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean court on Wednesday cleared the government and an adoption agency of all liability in a lawsuit filed by a 49-year-old Korean man whose traumatic adoption journey led to an abusive childhood in the United States and ultimately his deportation to South Korea in 2016 after legal troubles.",
      "In exonerating the South Korean government over the case of Adam Crapser, whose U.S. adoptive parents never secured his citizenship, the Seoul High Court overturned a 2023 lower court ruling that ordered his adoption agency, Holt Children\u2019s Services, to pay him 100 million won ($68,600) in damages. The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Holt should have informed his adoptive parents that they needed to take additional steps to secure his citizenship after his adoption was finalized in their state court, but didn\u2019t find the government at fault for Crapser\u2019s plight.",
      "The full text of the Seoul High Court\u2019s ruling wasn\u2019t immediately available. Crapser didn\u2019t attend the ruling.",
      "Crapser, a married father of two, says he was abused and abandoned by two different adoptive families who never filed his citizenship papers. He got into trouble with the law \u2014 once for breaking into his adoptive parents\u2019 home to retrieve the Bible that came with him from the orphanage \u2014 and was deported because he was not a U.S. citizen.",
      "In their defense against the accusations of malfeasance raised by Crapser, the government and Holt both cited a 1970s adoption law established under a military dictatorship that was designed to speed up adoptions.",
      "The law, enacted in January 1977, eased adoption agencies\u2019 obligations to check on the citizenship status of the children they sent overseas and removed judicial oversight of foreign adoptions, as part of various steps to empower agencies to process adoptions faster.",
      "The government and Holt, which facilitated Crapser\u2019s adoption to Michigan in 1979, both invoked the law to argue they had no legal responsibility to ensure that he received his citizenship.",
      "Critics say the law enabled careless and fraudulent practices that helped fuel what\u2019s believed to be the largest international adoption program in history. From the 1960s to 1980s, South Korea was ruled by a succession of military leaders who prioritized economic growth and promoted adoptions as a way to get rid of mouths to feed and establish closer ties with the West.",
      "Crapser\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t immediately say whether he would appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court. The Justice Ministry, which represents the government in lawsuits, and Holt didn\u2019t immediately comment on the ruling.",
      "More than 4,000 Korean children were sent abroad in 1979, the year Crapser was sent to a family in Michigan at age 3. He became the first Korean adoptee to sue the South Korean government and an adoption agency for damages in 2019.",
      "The government and Holt were also sued last year by a Korean birth mother who said they were responsible for her daughter\u2019s adoption to the United States in 1976, months after the child was kidnapped at age 4.",
      "The lawsuits, combined with an ongoing fact-finding investigation into complaints from hundreds of adoptees who suspect their origins were falsified or obscured, have put pressure on the South Korean government to address the widespread fraud and questionable practices of the past.",
      "Crapser\u2019s lawsuit accused Holt of manipulating his paperwork to describe him as an orphan despite the existence of a known birth mother, exposing him to abusive adoptive parents by botching background checks and not following up on whether he obtained U.S. citizenship.",
      "It said government officials should also be held accountable for failing to protect Crapser\u2019s constitutional rights as a South Korean child, poorly monitoring an agency they licensed to handle foreign adoptions and not verifying whether his adoption was based on proper consent or whether his adoptive families were qualified to be decent parents.",

      "Thai police say an arrest warrant has been issued for a man suspected of gunning down a former opposition politician from Cambodia in a popular Bangkok tourist area",
      "BANGKOK -- Thai police on Wednesday said an arrest warrant has been issued for a man suspected of gunning down a former opposition politician from Cambodia in a popular Bangkok tourist area.",
      "Lim Kimya, an ex-lawmaker from the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party, was shot dead near a temple close to Khaosan Road on Tuesday evening. He had reportedly just arrived at the scene with his wife by bus from Cambodia, said the New York-based Human Rights Watch.",
      "Siam Boonsom, chief of Bangkok police, told reporters on Wednesday the initial investigation led them to believe the gunman was hired to carry out the shooting and that Lim Kimya was possibly identified to the gunman by another person, whom police are also pursuing. Siam declined to provide further details, citing an ongoing investigation.",
      "Thai media have reported the suspected shooter might be a former Thai marine. Siam declined to confirm this detail but said the suspect had a criminal record related to financial matters.",
      "Security camera footage of the incident circulated in Thai media showed the suspected gunman arriving at the scene on a motorbike. Three gunshots were heard before the man walked away from the victim as he collapsed to the ground. The suspect, who did not cover his face, then rode away on the motorbike.",
      "The Cambodia National Rescue Party said in a statement it was \u201cdeeply shocked and appalled by the brutal and inhumane assassination\" and urged the Thai authorities to conduct a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice.",
      "The party had been expected to present a strong challenge to the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party of ex-Prime Minister Hun Sen in the 2018 general election. But as part of a sweeping crackdown on opposition before the poll, the high court dissolved the party, and the ruling party subsequently won every seat in the National Assembly.",
      "Recent posts on Lim Kimya's Facebook page were critical of the government, including how it had spent state money unnecessarily on events that did not benefit the Cambodian people.",
      "Under Hun Sen, who held power for almost four decades, Cambodia was widely criticized for human rights abuses that included the suppression of freedom of speech and association. He was succeeded in August 2023 by his American-educated son, Hun Manet, but there have been few signs of political liberalization.",
      "Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates, said the shooting \u201chas all the hallmarks of a political assassination, and looks to be a significant escalation in the use of transnational repression in Bangkok\u201d to intimidate opposition of the ruling government.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s government has long been accused of using the judicial system to persecute critics and political opponents. The government insists it promotes the rule of law under an electoral democracy, but political parties seen as mounting strong challenges to the ruling party have been dissolved by the courts or had their leaders jailed or harassed.",
      "Lim Kimya's shooting came on the same day that Hun Sen, who is now the head of Cambodia's Senate, called for the government to pass a law that would label certain dissident actions as terrorism.",
      "Hun Sen, sitting alongside his son, Hun Manet, to mark the 46th anniversary of the ousting of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime that ruled in Cambodia in the late 1970s \u2014 and which left some 1.7 million Cambodians dead from starvation, illness and mass executions \u2014 called for a new law to define people who want to overthrow Hun Manet\u2019s government as \u201cterrorists.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:26:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week&rsquo;s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska&rsquo;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes.",
      "Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Fed's 19 policymakers. Some officials expressed support for keeping the central bank's key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call.",
      "Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "Still, there was widespread agreement in the minutes that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, Fed officials felt it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate.",
      "Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses \u2014 including for homes, cars, and credit cards \u2014 will remain elevated this year.",
      "Policymakers said that the Fed \u201cwas at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing,\u201d the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting, Fed officials said they expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four.",
      "Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a \u201cclose call.\"",
      "Powell also said that recent signs of stubborn inflation have caused many Fed officials to pare back their expectations for rate cuts. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, ticked up to 2.4% in November, compared with a year ago, above the Fed's target. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, it was 2.8%.",
      "In addition, some officials have started to consider the potential impact of President-elect Trump's proposals, such as widespread tariffs, on the economy and inflation next year, the minutes said.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs, for example, have estimated that Trump's tariff proposals could push inflation by nearly a half-percentage point later this year.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he still supported rate reductions this year, in part because he expects inflation to steadily head down to the Fed's 2% target. He also said he didn't expect tariffs would worsen inflation and wouldn't change his preference for lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Waller also said, in a question and answer session, that he didn't think Trump would ultimately impose the universal tariffs he promised in the campaign."

      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort have reached a deal to end a strike that put a wrench in operations during the busy holiday season",
      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort reached a tentative deal with the corporate owner of Utah's Park City Mountain Resort to end a strike and resume normal operations after almost two weeks of closed terrain and long lift lines at the busiest time of year.",
      "Neither the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association nor Colorado-based Vail Resorts released details about the agreement ahead of a planned ratification vote Wednesday.",
      "Whatever happens, the strike brought attention \u2014 and judging from the many supportive car honks for strikers, sympathy \u2014 to the struggle of ski patrollers to make ends meet in pricey mountain communities.",
      "A union win could produce better pay for other ski workers, predicted one industry watcher.",
      "\u201cGenerally when one group of employees successfully bargains for a contract they think is fair, it does tend to create the \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 dynamic,\u201d said Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and the cost of living is well above average.",
      "The 200 ski patrollers at Park City Mountain Resort went on strike on Dec. 27 alleging unfair bargaining in negotiations since March. The tentative deal to be in effect through April 2027 had the unanimous approval of ski patrol negotiators, according to a joint statement from the union and the resort.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks forward to restoring normal resort operations and moving forward together as one team,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody\u2019s nearby. It\u2019s specialized work where familiarity with a resort\u2019s terrain and how to respond to a variety of injuries and situations can be valuable.",
      "It's also a seasonal job. Many ski patrollers work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in warmer months.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "It also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It was offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren't unusual, but this strike happened after talks went much longer into the year than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Kaufman.",
      "\"The issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\" Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Despite long waits, even some Park City Mountain Resort skiers have been sympathetic to the workers. \u201cPay your employees!\u201d they chanted from lift lines in videos posted on social media.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers\u2019 ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House."

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS boosted taxpayer services through Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act but still faces processing claims from a coronavirus pandemic-era tax credit program and is slow to resolve certain identity theft cases, according to an independent watchdog report released Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the first time since I became the National Taxpayer Advocate in 2020, I can begin this report with good news: The taxpayer experience has noticeably improved,\u201d Erin M. Collins wrote in her 2024 annual report to Congress.",
      "She said \u201cthe IRS has made major strides\u201d with the help of the billions of dollars in multiyear funding, though she notes that \u201cIRS service remains far from perfect.\u201d",
      "Remaining service gaps include prolonged delays in resolving claims from the nearly half a million taxpayers whose identities were stolen by fraudsters who received a refund on their behalf. The delays have increased from 19 months in 2023 to 22 months in 2024, according to the report.",
      "In addition, the report says there have been lengthy delays in the resolution of eligible Employee Retention Credit claims submitted by employers who rely on those refunds to stay in business.",
      "The Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, was designed to help businesses retain employees during pandemic-era shutdowns, but it quickly became a magnet for fraud. Its complex eligibility rules allowed scammers to target small businesses, offering help applying for it for a fee \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t qualify.",
      "In September 2023, the IRS announced a pause in accepting claims for the tax credit until 2024 because of rising concerns that an influx of applications were fraudulent.",
      "\u201cAlthough the IRS has processed several hundred thousand claims in recent months, it was still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024,\" Collins said in her Wednesday report. \u201cMany claims have been pending for more than a year.\u201d",
      "IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said \u201cthings are trending in a very positive direction in terms of our performance in taxpayer service,\u201d but still, \u201cI view the identity theft issue as our largest current service gap.\u201d He said the agency is seeing higher numbers of theft victims overall since before the pandemic, in part because scammers are increasingly moving to online schemes.",
      "Werfel said the agency is adding more resources to the issue and streamlining identity theft cases by distinguishing between complex and simpler cases to resolve taxpayer issues faster.",
      "Among other recommendations, the taxpayer advocate is calling on Congress to expand the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear refund cases, give the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic program more financial leeway to help taxpayers and require the IRS to process claims for refund or credits in a timely manner.",
      "Collins said many IRS improvements, including faster service and quicker phone response times, have been made possible by multiyear funding provided by Congress. However, that funding is at risk of being cut.",
      "The federal tax collection agency originally received an $80 billion infusion of funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, though a 2023 debt ceiling and budget cut deal between Republicans and the Democratic White House resulted in $1.4 billion rescinded from the agency and a separate agreement to take $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years and divert those funds to other nondefense programs.",
      "Now, Treasury Department officials are calling on Congress to unlock another $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen.",
      "Werfel said the boost in the IRS budget \u201chas played an absolutely critical role\" in improvements to taxpayer services. \u201cWe\u2019ve put the money to good use,\" he said.",
      "If Congress does slash Inflation Reduction Act enforcement funding, Collins recommends that it not make cuts to taxpayer services and information technology. Congress should not, Collins said, \u201cinadvertently throw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d"

    "summary": "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
    "story": [
      "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
      "BOSTON -- The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right?",
      "Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises.",
      "Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That's down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data.",
      "That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100.",
      "Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That's a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%.",
      "Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study.",
      "\u201cWe know that during COVID, a lot of institutions \u2014 public and private \u2014 froze tuition,\u201d Ma said.",
      "As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022.",
      "Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson's decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada.",
      "\u201cI originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,\u201d said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school.",
      "Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years.",
      "Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data.",
      "\u201cInstitutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states\u2019 efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting \u2014 as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students.",
      "Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall.",
      "Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.",

      "U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in nearly a year last week, pointing to a still healthy labor market with historically low layoffs.",
      "The Labor Department on Wednesday said that applications for jobless benefits fell to 201,000 for the week ending January 4, down from the previous week's 211,000. This week's figure is the lowest since February of last year.",
      "The four-week average of claims, which evens out the week-to-week ups and downs, fell by 10,250 to 213,000.",
      "The overall numbers receiving unemployment benefits for the week of December 28 rose to 1.87 million, an increase of 33,000 from the previous week.",
      "The U.S. job market has cooled from the red-hot stretch of 2021-2023 when the economy was rebounding from COVID-19 lockdowns.",
      "Through November, employers added an average of 180,000 jobs a month in 2024, down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021. Still, even the diminished job creation is solid and a sign of resilience in the face of high interest rates.",
      "When the Labor Department releases hiring numbers for December on Friday, they\u2019re expected to show that employers added 160,000 jobs last month.",
      "On Tuesday, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in November, showing companies are still looking for workers even as the labor market has loosened. Openings rose to 8.1 million in November, the most since February and up from 7.8 million in October,",
      "The weekly jobless claims numbers are a proxy for layoffs, and those have remained below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate is at a modest 4.2%, though that is up from a half century low 3.4% reached in 2023.",
      "To fight inflation that hit four-decade highs two and a half years ago, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation came down \u2014 from 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.7% in November, allowing the Fed to start cutting rates. But progress on inflation has stalled in recent months, and year-over-year consumer price increases are stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "In December, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate for the third time in 2024, but the central bank\u2019s policymakers signaled that they\u2019re likely to be more cautious about future rate cuts. They projected just two in 2025, down from the four they had envisioned in September.",

    "story": [
      "A top policymaker at the US Federal Reserve says that he still supports reducing interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top policymaker at the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's board of governors, said he expects inflation will move closer to the Fed's 2% target in the coming months. And in some of the first comments by a Fed official specifically about tariffs, he said that greater import duties likely won't push up inflation this year.",
      "\u201cMy bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said in Paris at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "\u201cIf, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view,\u201d Waller added.",
      "His remarks are noteworthy because the impact of tariffs is a key wild card for the economy this year. Waller also suggested he is more optimistic about inflation than many Wall Street investors, who increasingly expect the Fed to keep its rate steady this year as elevated prices continue to linger.",
      "\u201cI believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% goal over the medium term and that further (rate) reductions will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said. While inflation has been persistent in recent months \u2014 it ticked up to 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 Waller argued that outside of housing, which is difficult to measure, prices are cooling.",
      "Waller\u2019s remarks run counter to increasing expectations on Wall Street that the Fed may not cut its key rate much, if at all, this year. It is currently about 4.3% after several reductions last year from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Financial markets are expecting just one rate reduction in 2025, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "Waller did not say how many cuts he specifically supports. Instead he said that Fed officials projected two reductions this year, as a group, in December. But he also noted that policymakers supported a wide range of outcomes, from no cuts to as many as five. The number of reductions will depend on progress towards reducing inflation, he added."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 09:47:20 -0500",
    "summary": "This week&rsquo;s winter wallop across the U.S. means different things to farmers in different places",
    "story": [
      "This week\u2019s winter wallop across the U.S. means different things to farmers in different places",
      "A nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard \u2014 including farmers And more is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.",
      "Farmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.",
      "Producers know that the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead \u2014 something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they\u2019re going to farm this year, what they\u2019re going to grow,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.\"",
      "Biting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas \u201cin ways that we haven\u2019t seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,\u201d said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool. It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use \u2014 along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth \u2014 to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.",
      "The risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.",
      "That means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key \u2014 which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. And not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is \u201creally, really stressful on producers,\u201d Redmond said.",
      "The storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.",
      "He added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn\u2019t matter. We look forward to a good freeze,\u201d Swanson said.",
      "The lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.",
      "Reliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat\u2019s crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius) even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot you can do, unfortunately,\u201d when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too \u2014 he pointed out last year's likely record warmth \u2014 and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.",
      "\u201cWe were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,\" Larsen said.",
      "Gary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm. He said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have \u201cforced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at averages, it\u2019s very deceiving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's either all or none.\u201d",

      "All-wheel drive might not be a must-have, but it adds safety, security and peace of mind if you live in a cold climate",
      "All-wheel drive might not be a must-have, but it sure is nice to have if you live in any of the large swaths of America that regularly see snow. Certainly a good set of winter tires will get the job done much of the time, but if you want ultimate peace of mind, there\u2019s no substitute for all-wheel drive. Combine the two and you\u2019re virtually unstoppable.",
      "All-wheel drive was once rare in cars, but over the last 20 years it\u2019s become a much more common feature. Especially in the last 10 years, carmakers have added all-wheel drive to existing models as well as producing new all-wheel-drive models, helping to make this feature as affordable as it is ubiquitous.",
      "Edmunds\u2019 editors recognize lots of people want the confidence of all-wheel drive without buying a bulky SUV. Accordingly, they\u2019ve compiled this list of all-wheel-drive cars that can be found on the used market for less than $25,000.",
      "BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans and 4 Series coupes are sport-luxury cars recognized for their engaging handling. With the exception of one generation of cars, the 3 Series has offered all-wheel drive in the U.S. since the mid-1980s when it debuted in the 325ix. And 4 Series coupes, introduced for the 2014 model year, have offered all-wheel drive since their inception. The most common 3 Series and 4 Series models on the used market today are contemporary trims fitted with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making in the mid-200-horsepower range.",
      "Look for: If you want more power, you can find BMW\u2019s 3.0-liter six-cylinder good for as much as 320 horsepower in upper trims. But you\u2019ll be trading power for condition or higher miles in this price range.",
      "2013-2022 3 Series and 4 Series approximate pricing: $10,000-$25,000",
      "Even eight years after its debut Tesla\u2019s Model 3 feels like the future inside. With a flat dash adorned only by a large central screen, the Tesla gestalt is in full effect in this compact electric sedan. Sure, it takes some adjustment for the Model 3\u2019s unconventional controls to become second nature, but they hardly diminish the experience. All-wheel-drive trims have been available since the 2018 model year.",
      "Look for: The fine print. Besides the tiny badge, there\u2019s no easy way to distinguish the all-wheel-drive versions from the rear-wheel-drive versions. The Long Range trim reduces range anxiety and still fits our budget.",
      "2018-2024 Model 3 approximate pricing: $13,000-$25,000",
      "One of the earliest all-wheel-drive Japanese sedans, the Impreza made a name for itself through a rich motorsport legacy even if most Imprezas were workaday models. Imprezas from the last decade are available in both sedan and hatchback body styles with either a 2.0-liter or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, both of which made modest power. But every Impreza sold in the U.S. since 1997 is all-wheel-drive. There\u2019s nothing luxurious about the Impreza, but its combination of all-wheel drive and priced-right utility makes it great for winter driving.",
      "Look for: Low-mileage Imprezas. Cars with 10,000 miles or less can be found well inside our price cap.",
      "2012-2024 Impreza approximate pricing: $5,000-$25,000",
      "Mazda began to offer all-wheel drive in its compact Mazda 3 in 2019. Sedan and five-door hatchback body styles are available as are two engines, both 2.5-liter four-cylinders. The upgrade engine is turbocharged and produces 250 horsepower (starting in 2021), but the base engine is fine. The Mazda 3 is an overachiever inside with premium materials that verge into luxury territory. It\u2019s also one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class and its stunning good looks are hard to ignore. But it\u2019s smaller inside than many competitors.",
      "Look for: The hatchback body offers an additional 7 cubic feet of cargo space over the sedan. Consider it if space is important.",

      "The Altima isn\u2019t the only midsize sedan offering all-wheel drive, but the others \u2014 the Toyota Camry and Kia K5 \u2014 are far less abundant. Starting in the 2019 model year, when it was last redesigned, Nissan added all-wheel drive to the Altima. The drivetrain pairs only with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, but it\u2019s very efficient, exceeding the EPA estimate of 30 mpg combined by 4 mpg in Edmunds\u2019 testing.",

      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republicans will push to limit lawsuits when the legislative session starts this month",
      "ATLANTA -- After years of stalled efforts to limit civil lawsuits, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican lawmakers are doubling down with a new push.",
      "Supporters, most prominently business groups, call the state a \u201cjudicial hellhole,\u201d and argue that businesses are being crushed by rising insurance costs driven by excessive lawsuits that have helped plaintiffs get big payouts.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not about business,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s about every Georgian paying more and more premiums for their insurance. Whatever we can do to make it more affordable to own a home, operate your vehicle and protect your family with insurance, we need to do it.\u201d",
      "But opponents say there's no proof that lawsuits are closely linked to rising insurance rates and that limits will make it harder for injured parties to win justice in court.",
      "\u201cThis is about trying to do some favors for people who hopefully will line your political pockets,\u201d said Jen Jordan, an attorney and former Democratic state senator. \u201cAt the end of the day, Georgians are going to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Kemp in 2022 promised the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, one of his top allies, that he would seek to limit lawsuit costs, a push that many call \u201ctort reform.\u201d But he admitted in 2023 that the effort was complicated, and instead signed a law to gather data on lawsuit verdicts.",
      "Even as Kemp held events to build public support ahead of the legislative session, which begins Monday, the Republican governor is having to contend with GOP lawyers in the General Assembly who make a living by filing lawsuits, Democrats who mostly oppose changes, and a state Supreme Court that has voided earlier limits.",
      "One key issue is lawsuits against stores, apartment complexes and other businesses over crimes or injuries on their property. In one such lawsuit, Georgia mother Sheila Brooks sued Family Dollar and Dollar Tree last year after her son Lem Johnny Johnson IV was fatally shot at one of their south Atlanta stores.",
      "Police say the shooter wasn't a Family Dollar employee, but the lawsuit alleges that Family Dollar knew about earlier incidents \u201cinvolving gunshots, gunplay, assault, violent threats with weapons, and disturbing acts of violence\" at and near the location. The store should have taken more security measures to protect their customers, the complaint said.",
      "Supporters of lawsuit limits say property owners shouldn't be held responsible for the wrongdoing of customers and trespassers.",
      "\u201cIf we fix this problem, Georgia could be a much easier, well-perceived place for businesses and their insurers,\u201d said attorney Bill Custer. \u201cIt will fix our reputation as a bad-boy state.\u201d",
      "Nancy Palmer, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said Georgia\u2019s legal landscape has driven insurance companies out, making it difficult for businesses to get adequate coverage. She said insurance costs have become \u201cuntenable\u201d across industries, affecting day care centers, grocery store owners, pharmacies, low-income housing providers and others in urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Darion Dunn, a managing partner at Atlantic Strategies, which develops affordable housing and is behind a micro community for previously unsheltered people known as \u201cThe Melody,\u201d said insurance companies are raising premiums or denying coverage in areas they label as \u201chigh crime\" due to concerns about litigation.",
      "\u201cBecause of these rising insurance costs, we\u2019ve had to walk away from projects that would otherwise have brought much-needed affordable housing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Dunn wants to see lawmakers limit the amount of compensation people can seek for non-economic damages such as emotional pain and suffering. Georgia\u2019s legislature capped such verdicts in 2005, but the state Supreme Court overturned the law in 2010 as unconstitutional.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association disputes the idea that insurance costs are rising because of jury verdicts, and said in a statement that \u201cinsurance companies have continued to raise premiums despite making record profits.\u201d",
      "To limit a property owner's liability, lawmakers could limit the kind of evidence lawyers can use to prove property owners knew about the risk of incidents like Johnson's killing.",
      "Lawmakers could also instruct juries to assign a minimum amount of blame to the person who committed the crime. In an oft-cited 2023 case, a man was awarded almost $43 million in a lawsuit against CVS after he was shot in a CVS parking lot during an armed robbery. The jury found CVS 95% responsible for the shooting, the victim 5% responsible and assigned no responsibility to the shooter.",
      "These kinds of large verdicts are rare, said Madeline Summerville, an Atlanta attorney and political consultant for Democrats. She said large verdicts often result when insurers refuse to settle cases they should, and while some cases are \u201cfrivolous,\u201d most aren't.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t make legislation based on the fact that there\u2019s a minority of folks that are trying to game the system and then convince all of the people of Georgia that that\u2019s the majority of the cases that are coming through,\" Summerville said.",
      "Summerville is particularly worried about changes to medical malpractice lawsuits, where people sue medical providers for botched work. If medical practitioners aren't held accountable, the level of care will decline, she said.",
      "In a roundtable hosted by Kemp last fall, medical executives said insurance costs are rising and doctors fear working in Georgia because they might get sued. Van Loskoski, CEO of Stephens County Hospital in Toccoa, said the hospital couldn't recruit obstetricians because of the fear of lawsuits and stopped delivering babies in 2021. The hospital\u2019s medical malpractice premiums then fell by 13%, Loskoski said.",
      "Lawmakers also could consider other measures, including some similar to laws passed in Florida in 2023. For example, they could require attorneys to show jurors how much plaintiffs actually paid in medical bills, as opposed to \u201cphantom damages\u201d based on the amounts they were originally charged. Legislators could also order separate trials to determine who is at fault for medical damages and what those damages are.",

      "The strong reports are of course good news for workers looking for jobs  and for anyone worried about a possible recession that earlier seemed inevitable to pessimists. But such a solid economy could also keep up pressure on inflation, and it could make the Federal Reserve less likely to deliver the cuts to interest rates that Wall Street loves.",
      "The Fed began cutting its main interest rate in September  to give the economy a boost, but it\u2019s hinted a slowdown in easing  is coming. The threat of tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump  has raised worries about possible upward pressure on inflation, which has stubbornly remained just above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",

      "Expectations for fewer cuts to interest rates in 2025 have already been building for weeks. That sent longer-term Treasury yields upward. So have worries about other possible Trump policies, such as tax cuts, which could swell the U.S. government\u2019s debt and likewise push yields higher.",
      "Those higher yields make Treasury bonds more attractive to investors who might otherwise buy stocks, which in turn puts downward pressure on stock prices, and the super-safe bonds are paying notably more.

      "The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high",
      "DENVER -- The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high by using both an algorithm to help set rents and privately sharing sensitive information with their competitors to boost profits.",
      "The lawsuit arrives as U.S. renters continue to struggle under a merciless housing market, with incomes failing to keep up with rent increases. The latest figures show that half of American renters spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, an all-time high.",
      "That means exhausting, day-to-day decisions between medications, groceries, school supplies and rent. It means eviction notices and protracted court cases in which children face the highest eviction rates, with 1.5 million evicted each year, according to Princeton University's Eviction Lab.",
      "While the housing crisis has been assigned several causes, including a slump in homes built over the last decade, the Justice Department's lawsuit claims major landlords are playing a part.",
      "The department, along with 10 states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado and California, is accusing six landlords that collectively operate more than 1.3 million units in 43 states and the District of Columbia of scheming to avoid lowering rents.",
      "The landlord Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC, a defendant in the case, declined a request for comment from The Associated Press, but published an unsigned statement on its website.",
      "\u201cGreystar has and will conduct its business with the utmost integrity. At no time did Greystar engage in any anti-competitive practices,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves in this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit accuses the landlords of sharing sensitive data on rents and occupancy with competing firms via email, phone calls or in groups. The information shared allegedly included renewal rates, how often they accept an algorithm's price recommendation, the use of concessions such as offering one month free, and even their approach to pricing for the next quarter.",
      "The Justice Department said one of the six landlords agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The proposed settlement would restrict how the company can use their competitors' data and algorithms to set rents.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s action against RealPage and six major landlords seeks to end their practice of putting profits over people and make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,\u201d said Doha Mekki, the acting assistant attorney general for the department\u2019s antitrust division in Tuesday\u2019s press release.",
      "Those landlords were added to an existing lawsuit against RealPage, which runs an algorithm that recommends rental prices to landlords. Prosecutors say the algorithm uses sensitive competitive information, allowing landlords to align their prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents.",
      "Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage's senior vice president for communications, said in a statement to the AP that their software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that their price recommendations are used less than half the time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s past time to stop scapegoating RealPage \u2014 and now our customers -- for housing affordability problems when the root cause of high housing costs is the under-supply of housing,\u201d Bowcock said.",

      "LONDON -- Fresh from pouring his money and energies into helping Donald Trump win reelection, Elon Musk has trained his sights on Europe, setting off alarm bells among politicians across the continent.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX chief executive has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany, demanded the release of jailed U.K. anti-Islam extremist Tommy Robinson and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an evil tyrant who should be in prison.",
      "Many European politicians have been left concerned by the attention. Musk\u2019s feed on his social network X is dotted with abusive language \u2014 labeling politicians \u201cstupid cretin\u201d and \u201csniveling cowards\u201d \u2014 as well as retweets of far-right and anti-immigrant accounts.",
      "Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at Loughborough University, said Musk is using X \u201ca bit like an old-style newspaper mogul,\u201d to promulgate his political views.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Musk start to align himself much more obviously with an international movement of the far right,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201dIf you look at the kinds of people who Musk himself is boosting on his platform \u2026 he\u2019s increasingly started to assemble a group of different right-wing influencers, many of them with large followings, and presenting their evidence as a basis for his interventions into European politics.\u201d",
      "Musk has inserted himself into politics in Germany, which is headed for a Feb. 23 election after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fractious three-party coalition government collapsed.",
      "On Dec. 20, Musk wrote on X: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d a reference to the Alternative for Germany party, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "He doubled down on support for the AfD in an article for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, claiming Germany is \u201cteetering on the edge of economic and cultural collapse.\u201d Later this week Musk is due to hold a live chat on X with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel.",
      "Scholz\u2019s response embodies the dilemma faced by European politicians \u2014 should they ignore and let Musk\u2019s comments go unchallenged, or engage and risk amplifying them?",
      "Scholz has said it\u2019s important to \u201cstay cool\u201d over personal attacks, but called Musk\u2019s involvement in German politics worrying. In a new year message, Scholz pointedly noted that Germany\u2019s way forward \u201cwill not be decided by the owners of social media channels\u201d but by German voters.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron warned Monday about the risks posed by unchecked power in the hands of tech billionaires and the destabilizing impact they could have on democratic institutions.",
      "\u201cWho could have imagined, 10 years ago, that the owner of one of the world\u2019s largest social networks would intervene directly in elections, including in Germany?\u201d Macron said.",
      "Greek Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis said Musk\u2019s behavior was \u201ctroubling and far from amusing.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomeone cannot simply use their platform, wealth and connections to try to dictate how governments are formed in each nation,\u201d he told Parapolitika Radio. \u201cThis is becoming increasingly dangerous.\u201d",
      "Musk has increasingly focused on British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July, calling Starmer an \u201cevil\u201d leader presiding over a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s recent focus is on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns several years ago, in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of mostly white girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration and Islam.",
      "Musk has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 \u2014 a charge Starmer strongly denies.",
      "\u201cStarmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,\u201d Musk tweeted.",
      "Chadwick said \u201cthere\u2019s been a hesitancy on the part of the political elite in the U.K. to engage\u201d with Musk\u2019s \u201cincredibly inflammatory remarks.\u201d But Starmer changed tack Monday, condemning \u201clies and misinformation\u201d and accusing U.K. Conservative politicians who have echoed some of Musk\u2019s points of \u201camplifying what the far right are saying.\u201d",
      "\u201cI enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that\u2019s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies,\u201d the prime minister said.",
      "Starmer is facing calls to tighten Britain\u2019s laws on foreign interference, and governments around the world are under pressure to leave X. Both the U.K. and German governments say they have no plans to quit the platform.",
      "Musk\u2019s X is under investigation by European authorities attempting to curb hatred, disinformation and other toxic content on social media. The European Union has launched infringement proceedings against X under the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act, and EU spokesman Thomas Regnier said it will look at whether Musk's livestream interview Thursday with the AfD's Weidel gives inappropriate \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to the party during a preelection period.",
      "Musk, a self-styled free-speech advocate, is critical of efforts to regulate social media. He has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation through the Online Safety Act to censorship in the Soviet Union.",
      "Musk clearly enjoys baiting mainstream politicians on social media, but Chadwick said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether his posting changes public attitudes or helps the causes he champions.",
      "And the political interventions carry risk for him. His comments are being watched closely by Tesla investors for signs he could be turning off car buyers who don\u2019t agree with his politics.",
      "Tesla is already struggling in Europe, where new registrations for Musk\u2019s electronic vehicles fell 13% in the first nine months of 2023, according to auto researcher Jato Dynamics. In Germany, Tesla registrations dropped 44%.",
      "Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz said that Musk's outspokenness is rare and risky for the owner of a publicly traded company \u2014 though it may pay off in the end.",
      "\u201cEurope is going to (the) right,\u201d he said, pointing to politicians including France\u2019s Marine Le Pen and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to reject a bid by Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel on national security grounds isn\u2019t the first time friction over trade and investment has irked Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia.",
      "There have been plenty of scraps over trade in the past few decades, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken sought to smooth ruffled feathers in a visit to Tokyo on Tuesday.",
      "Nippon Steel Chief Executive Eiji Hashimoto said the top Japanese steelmaker was standing firm on its proposed $15 billion friendly acquisition. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration\u2019s decision.",
      "But the assertion that the proposed deal could threaten U.S. national security has stung.",
      "Many in Japan see the decision as a betrayal by Washington after decades of U.S. pressure to lift barriers to investment and trade. The timing doesn\u2019t help, with Japanese businesses already bracing for potentially damaging tariff hikes once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was blunt in warning that spoiling the deal might hurt Japanese investment in the U.S.",
      "Here are some key issues at stake:",
      "While in Tokyo in a farewell tour before Biden leaves office, Blinken told reporters he believes that during the past four years the alliance with Japan has \u201cgrown stronger than it's ever been before.\u201d Japan and the U.S. are mutually the largest investors in each other's economies, he noted, \u201cstrengthening the foundation for many years to come.\u201d Japan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.S. Steel decision came up during Blinken's meeting with Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. But it said only that the two sides had \u201creaffirmed the importance of Japan-U.S. economic relations, including investment in the U.S. by Japanese companies.\u201d",
      "Before Blinken's visit, Ishiba, who has struggled to build support and momentum since he took office in October, was emphatic.",
      "\u201cAs for why national security was cited as an issue, it must be clearly explained. Otherwise, future discussions on the matter will come to naught,\u201d he said Monday. \"No matter how much we are an ally, I believe that the points I have just made are extremely important for our future relations.\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that Japanese industry has voiced concerns about future investment between the U.S. and Japan. We have to take this very seriously.\u201d",
      "Japan's Trade Minister Yoji Muto said the decision was \u201cvery regrettable.\u201d Headlines in Japanese newspapers mainly focused on Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel's plan to fight the ruling in court.",
      "Japan is the biggest and most important U.S. ally in Asia, a relationship forged during the U.S. occupation following Japan's 1945 defeat in World War II. Nearly 63,000 troops are stationed at dozens of facilities across the country and Washington has urged Japan to build up its own defense capabilities as a counterweight to China's growing influence and military power.",
      "Japan counts on the U.S. to provide an umbrella of defense against its neighbors China, Russia and North Korea. Some critics have chafed at the decision to reject Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, saying Washington was treating Japan like it does China, a potential adversary.",
      "\u201cWhen is an ally not a partner? Apparently when a Japanese company seeks to purchase an iconic U.S. corporation,\u201d The newspaper The Japan Times said in an editorial. It described the concerns over national security as \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d adding \u201cTrust has been greatly damaged and it is unclear what will be required to undo the harm.\u201d",
      "Biden and Trump have both supported higher tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from China, saying they are needed to insulate American producers from unfair trade practices and a flood of cheap imports. In 2018, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports of Japanese steel on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The Biden administration agreed to a deal in 2022 to allow a certain quota of some steel products to be imported tariff-free. Any above that amount is subject to the 25% tariff.",
      "Today's trade frictions follow decades of negotiations that have led Japan to open its markets much more widely to foreign goods and services, transforming its retailing from mostly old-style department stores and mom-and-pop shops into outlet malls and big discount stores. Such \u201cgai-atsu,\u201d or foreign pressure, led Japanese automakers and other manufacturers chose to invest in U.S. factories, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel contend their deal would save American jobs, and business groups on both sides have objected to seeing the deal fall through as part of a broad shift in recent years away from greater openness."

      "HONG KONG -- The U.S. Defense Department has added dozens of Chinese companies, including games and technology company Tencent, artificial intelligence firm SenseTime and the world\u2019s biggest battery maker CATL, to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, prompting some to protest and say they will seek to have the decision reversed.",
      "The U.S. has in recent years sought to restrict sharing of advanced technology, including semiconductors and artificial intelligence, deeming it to be a threat to national security. The Defense Department updates its list of \u201cChinese Military Companies,\u201d or CMC list, annually. With the latest revision it includes 134 companies. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2024 bans the Department of Defense from dealing with the designated companies beginning in June 2026.",
      "Tencent's Hong Kong-traded shares fell 7.3% on Tuesday and the company said it would \u201cinitiate a reconsideration process to correct this mistake,\u201d seek talks with the Defense Department and if need be take legal measures to get it removed from the list. Tencent is the world's largest video gaming company and operates Chinese messaging platform WeChat.",
      "\u201cAs the company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake,\u201d Tencent said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \u201cUnlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group,\u201d it said.",
      "Battery maker CATL said in a statement posted on its website that the company \u201chas never engaged in any military-related business or activities\" and said the designation would not have adverse impact on its operations.",
      "Like Tencent, CATL maintains that its inclusion to the list was a \u201cmistake\u201d and that it would proactively engage with the DoD to \u201caddress the false designation\u201d and take legal action if necessary to protect company and stakeholder interest. CATL's stock fell 2.84% in Shenzhen.",
      "AI company SenseTime said in a statement that the decision to include it on the list had \u201cno factual basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe firmly disagree with it,\u201d SenseTime\u2019s statement read, adding that the decision has \u201cno material impact on our global operations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSenseTime remains firmly committed to working collaboratively with the relevant stakeholders to address this matter, and to safeguarding the interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d the company said.",
      "During a daily news briefing, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun urged the U.S. to \u201cimmediately correct its wrong practices, and lift the illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina consistently and firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, creating discriminatory lists under various pretexts, and unwarrantedly suppressing Chinese companies, hindering China\u2019s high-quality development,\u201d Guo said.",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation after facing an increasing loss of support both within his party and in the country.",
      "Now Trudeau's Liberal Party must find a new leader while dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods and with Canada's election just months away.",
      "Trudeau said Monday he plans to stay on as prime minister until a new party leader is chosen.",
      "He could not recover after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet last month.",
      "Trudeau, the 53-year-old scion of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s most famous prime ministers, became deeply unpopular with voters over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing as well as surging immigration.",
      "A new Canadian leader is unlikely to be named before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Canada the 51st state and has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs into the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of them cross the border from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs.",
      "Trump also remains preoccupied with the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted that a third of what Canada sells to the U.S. are energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high.",
      "If Trump applies tariffs, a trade war looms. Canada has vowed to retaliate.",
      "The Liberals need to elect a new leader before Parliament resumes March 24 because all three opposition parties say they will bring down the Liberal government in a no-confidence vote at the first opportunity, which would trigger an election. The new leader might not be prime minister for long.",
      "A spring election would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party.",
      "It\u2019s not often that central bank governors get compared to rock stars. But Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, was considered just that in 2012 when he was named the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. The appointment of a Canadian won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered faster than many other countries from the 2008 financial crisis. He gained a reputation along the way as a tough regulator.",
      "Few people in the world have Carney\u2019s qualifications. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who is widely credited with helping Canada dodge the worst of the 2008 global economic crisis and helping the U.K. manage Brexit. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister but lacks political experience.",
      "Freeland is also a front-runner. Trudeau told Freeland last month he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. An official close to Freeland said Freeland couldn\u2019t continue serving as a minister knowing she no longer enjoyed Trudeau's confidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The person added it's far too early to make declarations but said Freeland would talk to her colleagues this week and discuss next steps.",
      "After she resigned, Trump called Freeland \u201ctotally toxic\" and \"not at all conducive to making deals.\" Freeland is many things that would seem to irritate Trump: a liberal Canadian former journalist. She is a globalist who sits on the board of the World Economic Forum. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage, also has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
      "Another possible candidate is the new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. LeBlanc was Trudeau's babysitter when Trudeau was a child.",
      "Recent polls suggest the Liberals' chances of winning the next election look slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 47% to 21%.",
      "\u201cTrudeau\u2019s announcement might help the Liberals in the polls in the short run and, once a new leader is selected, things could improve further at least for a little while but that would not be so hard because, right now, they\u2019re so low in the polls,\u201d said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "\u201cMoreover, because Trudeau waited so long to announce his resignation, this will leave little time to his successor and the party to prepare for early elections,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "Many analysts say Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre will form the next government. Poilievre, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who blamed Canada\u2019s cost of living crisis on Trudeau. The 45-year-old Poilievre is a career politician who attracted large crowds during his run for his party's leadership. He has vowed to scrap a carbon tax and defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation."

      "The Food and Drug Administration has set maximum levels for lead in baby foods like jarred fruits and vegetables, yogurts and dry cereal",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday set maximum levels for lead in baby foods like jarred fruits and vegetables, yogurts and dry cereal, part of an effort to cut young kids' exposure to the toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological problems.",
      "The agency issued final guidance that it estimated could reduce lead exposure from processed baby foods by about 20% to 30%. The limits are voluntary, not mandatory, for food manufacturers, but they allow the FDA to take enforcement action if foods exceed the levels.",
      "It's part of the FDA's ongoing effort to \u201creduce dietary exposure to contaminants, including lead, in foods to as low as possible over time, while maintaining access to nutritious foods,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Consumer advocates, who have long sought limits on lead in children's foods, welcomed the guidance first proposed two years ago, but said it didn't go far enough.",
      "\u201cFDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cHowever, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\u201d",
      "The new limits on lead for children younger than 2 don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, which some research has shown contain higher levels of lead. And they don't limit other metals such as cadmium that have been detected in baby foods.",
      "Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, called the limits \"virtually meaningless because they\u2019re based more on industry feasibility and not on what would best protect public health.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for baby food maker Gerber said the company's products meet the limits.",
      "There\u2019s no safe level of lead exposure for children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The metal causes \u201cwell-documented health effects,\u201d including brain and nervous system damage and slowed growth and development. However, lead occurs naturally in some foods and comes from pollutants in air, water and soil, which can make it impossible to eliminate entirely.",
      "The FDA guidance sets a lead limit of 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals. The guidance covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes.",
      "The new guidance comes more than a year after lead-tainted pouches of apple cinnamon puree sickened more than 560 children in the U.S. between October 2023 and April 2024, according to the CDC.",
      "The levels of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum. Officials stressed that the agency doesn't need guidance to take action on foods that violate the law.",

A spokesperson for Vanderbilt said the company was reviewing the CFPB lawsuit Monday but didn't immediately comment. Clayton also didn't immediately respond. Both Vanderbilt and Clayton are based in Tennessee.",

      "Heisman Trophy runner-up Ashton Jeanty has announced he is leaving Boise State to enter the NFL draft",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Ashton Jeanty, who rushed for the second-most yards in a season in major-college football history and was runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, will leave Boise State to enter the NFL draft.",
      "Jeanty announced his decision on social media Tuesday, one week after the Broncos' season ended with a loss to Penn State in the College Football Playoff.",
      "Jeanty ran for 2,601 yards in 14 games, just behind the 2,628 by Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in 11 games in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to play in the NFL is a dream of mine, and I'm proud to represent Boise State and all of those who have helped me along the way at the next level,\u201d Jeanty wrote on X.",
      "Jeanty ran for 100 yards in every game this season and went over 200 in six. He averaged 6.95 yards per carry on a school-record and nation-leading 374 attempts, won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was a unanimous first-team Associated Press All-American.",
      "He had a three-year rushing total of 4,769 yards and 50 touchdowns.",

      "If it seems as though the 2025 professional tennis year started pretty much immediately right after 2024 ended, that\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what happens in a sport where the offseason really does not leave players much time to be \u201coff.\u201d",
      "If it seems as though the 2025 professional tennis year started pretty much immediately right after 2024 ended, that\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what happens in a sport where the offseason really does not leave players much time to be \u201coff.\u201d",
      "Actually, for tennis, 2025 began while the calendar still read 2024.",
      "\u201cI do, obviously, wish that the offseason was longer, 100%,\u201d said 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who began her \u201cyear\u201d by helping the American team win the United Cup title in Sydney, more than a week after that competition began on Dec. 27. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d",
      "When the Australian Open gets going Sunday morning in Melbourne (Saturday night EST), players will have tuned up by playing in various events that followed a period of practice and work in the gym that was longer for some than others.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is even an offseason anymore,\u201d 2021 Wimbledon semifinalist Denis Shapovalov said. \u201cThe season is never-ending.\u201d",
      "For the record, last season officially and finally wrapped up for good on Dec. 22, when Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Fonseca won the ATP Next Gen Finals in Saudi Arabia. He was back on a court later in December for the Challenger Tour stop in Canberra, Australia \u2014 which he also won.",
      "The golf season is similar, essentially running non-stop, without the multiple months off offered by team sports.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, we (have been) fighting to have a longer offseason. To be healthy \u2026 you at least need a two-month offseason. So it would be great to finish a little bit earlier,\u201d said Conchita Martinez, a former player who won the 1994 Wimbledon championship and is now the coach of Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.",
      "\u201cFor the health of the tour, for the health of the players,\" Martinez said, \"maybe (the season) should be a little bit shorter.\u201d",
      "This is, to be sure, not a new concern.",
      "Yet nothing seems to have changed. If anything, the problem is becoming more pronounced.",
      "And to Martinez's point, the opening week of this season included two singles finals in which one player stopped playing \u2014 Naomi Osaka in Auckland, New Zealand, and Reilly Opelka in Brisbane, Australia \u2014 because of an injury concern (it's also likely they wanted to make sure not to push themselves too hard with the year's first Grand Slam tournament on the horizon).",
      "That's why, as much as possible, the athletes try to find some down time before getting ready to ramp up for what's to come.",
      "\u201cI had 1\u00bd weeks that I didn\u2019t touch the tennis racket. I just threw it in my room. I didn\u2019t want to see it again,\u201d four-time major champ Carlos Alcaraz joked. \u201cIt was really helpful to disconnect a little bit.\u201d",
      "They say they view the time between seasons, however brief it might be, as an opportunity for a combination of rest and relaxation \u2014 the Maldives is a popular vacation spot, as a glance at player' social media makes clear \u2014 along with training and preparation, with an eye on trying to improve in some way.",
      "\u201cYou take a bit of a break. But you need to get right back on the court and in the gym to get ready for Australia,\u201d said Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2024. \u201cAs soon as you can, you need to practice, but there isn\u2019t a lot of time, so you have to figure out how to schedule things.\"",
      "Ben Shelton, a big server who was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and U.S. Open two years ago, spent time on his return game this offseason. He was representing the United States at the Davis Cup in Spain in late November, then playing an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in early December, before heading to his new home, Orlando, Florida, to get ready for January.",
      "Unlike many players, he skipped any competition in the first week of 2025, instead opting to enter an event in Auckland this week before heading to Melbourne.",
      "The mind-set, Shelton explains, amounts to: \u201cOh, I\u2019m six weeks off; I\u2019m not really \u2018match tough\u2019 right now.\"",
      "Some fans wonder why he and others opt to participate in exhibitions at all, but players say those don't take the same sort of toll that a day-after-day tournament, or even every-other-day Slam event, does. Hard to argue with someone choosing to make a little extra money on the side, too.",
      "And players make the case that no matter how much they can switch off in November or December, part of the issue is there are not many chances to do that during other months.",
      "\u201cIdeally we\u2019d have a little bit more time. It\u2019s such a short turnaround ... after such a long season. There\u2019s not enough days to recover,\u201d said Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who upset Novak Djokovic at last year's U.S. Open. \u201cTaking time off to let your body rest might hinder the preparation, but at the end of the day, you need your body to be ready. The schedule is just so hectic throughout the year.\u201d",

      "The Golden State Warriors are soul searching after another embarrassing defeat at home, this time to the Miami Heat two days after a 30-point pounding from the Sacramento Kings",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Coach Steve Kerr criticized his Golden State Warriors for being down and lacking \u201ca competitive spirit\" in their latest embarrassing loss.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that you\u2019ve got nothing, so we\u2019ve got to find a way to build that back up,\u201d Kerr said after a 114-98 loss to the Miami Heat on Tuesday night.",
      "That followed a 30-point pounding from the Sacramento Kings two nights earlier.",
      "Draymond Green is calling for the Warriors to rediscover their soul.",
      "Stephen Curry is making it clear he can hardly do it all himself.",
      "At one moment in the second half on Tuesday the two-time MVP looked up at the scoreboard almost as if in disbelief about how it was going. The Warriors are missing shots and missing defensive assignments when it matters most.",
      "\u201cBack-to-back no-shows pretty much,\u201d Curry said. \u201c... Nobody's giving up hope. You've got to have a sense of urgency, though.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a lot of soul searching going on for this group at Chase Center.",
      "Green addressed the team after Tuesday's demoralizing performance.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t be front-runners, we have to dig in, we have to find our soul, that\u2019s what Draymond kind of said,\u201d Trace Jackson-Davis shared. \u201cIt\u2019s our soul that we\u2019ve lost, we\u2019ve lost our spirit and we have to get that back.\u201d",
      "Golden State shot 14 for 50 from 3-point range and went 40 of 98 overall (40.8%).",
      "Curry wants no finger-pointing or comparisons, just a collective effort to turn the season around \u2014 acknowledging \"this particular team hasn't done anything.\"",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day we are a team and we are all tied together, we're all accountable for the results of each night how our season ends up,\" Curry said. \u201cIt's not just a me and Draymond thing, it's not just a me thing, it's a we thing. So what we all need to do is play with confidence, play with assertiveness, play with a belief that when you step on the floor you can beat anybody. Whether it happens or not that has to be the mindset.\u201d",
      "The Warriors missed the playoffs last year then began this season a promising 12-3 and with championship aspirations as Curry and Draymond Green try to add to the four titles they've captured together.",
      "\u201cWhen you experience winning you hate losing even more,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Now, Golden State is 18-18 and tied for ninth place with San Antonio in the jammed-up Western Conference. The Warriors were a 10th seed last season and were eliminated by the Kings in the play-in tournament.",
      "Sure, forward Jonathan Kuminga is sidelined for at least a few weeks with a sprained right ankle, while guards Gary Payton II and Brandin Podziemski are expected back from injuries sometime during the upcoming four-game road trip.",
      "Frustrated fans flocked for the exits early for a second straight game at Chase Center, where the blowout by the Kings still stung.",
      "\u201cI expected better energy. I think we're suffering from a crisis of confidence right now frankly,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou can see it, you can feel it. I don't mind missed shots but I mind when missed shots affect the defense and the attitude. We feel deflated right now and there's no room for feeling sorry for ourselves in the NBA. In life in general. We can't let disappointment dictate our approach to a game, we have to do the opposite. We have to bring more fire, we have to outcompete our opponents when things aren't going our way.\u201d",

    "summary": "Javon Small was the best player on mediocre teams during his first three college seasons",
    "story": [
      "Javon Small was the best player on mediocre teams during his first three college seasons",
      "Javon Small was the best player on mediocre teams during his first three college seasons. Now he\u2019s the Big 12\u2019s leading scorer and a major reason why short-handed West Virginia is relevant again.",
      "No. 21 West Virginia was picked to finish 13th in the 16-team Big 12 under first-year coach Darian DeVries. Buoyed by its first win at Kansas last week, West Virginia (11-3, 2-1 Big 12) is ranked for the first time in two years and is off to its best start since going 15-1 in the 2017-18 season. And DeVries has the best record for a first-year coach through 14 games at West Virginia since 1960-61.",
      "That's due in no small part to Small. He leads the league in scoring at 19.5 points per game \u2014three more points than anyone else. Two of his five career double-doubles have come in the past week that included a pair of 11-rebound games. He's among the league leaders in steals and free-throw percentage.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to keep going to him,\u201d DeVries said. \u201cHe\u2019s been incredible. He\u2019s playing at a high level. I think he\u2019s one of the best guards in the country.\u201d",
      "Small spent his first two seasons at East Carolina. He averaged team-highs of 16 points and six assists in 2022-23 before a leg injury ended his season and the Pirates lost nine of their final 15 games. At Oklahoma State last year he averaged 15 points and four assists on a team that went 12-20.",
      "He chose West Virginia because he was familiar with DeVries\u2019 system at Drake and knew Chester Frazier, who spent the last three seasons as an assistant at Illinois and is now West Virginia\u2019s associate head coach. Frazier brought current WVU players Sencire Harris and Amani Hansberry with him.",
      "\u201cI just do what the team needs me to do,\u201d Small said.",
      "Small and the Mountaineers will be challenged to keep up the pace.",
      "Small has logged the most minutes in the league. Upper body injuries have sidelined standout teammates Tucker DeVries and Jayden Stone. DeVries, a two-time Missouri Valley Conference player of the year at Drake, has missed six games while Stone, a prolific scorer at Detroit Mercy last season, has yet to play this season. Hansberry missed a game last week with an ankle injury.",
      "They'll also have to continue leaning hard on their defense, which had held four opponents to 50 or fewer points.",
      "\u201cDefense is all about communication,\u201d Small said. \u201cWe all understand our spots as far as where we\u2019re supposed to be. But if there\u2019s no communication, something might slip up or break down, then we won\u2019t know what to do. So you\u2019ve always got to talk.\u201d",
      "The depleted lineup took a hit Tuesday night. Small scored 17 points but no other Mountaineers were in double figures in a 75-56 loss to Arizona that snapped West Virginia's seven-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Injuries happen, foul trouble happens,\u201d Darian DeVries said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play. That\u2019s just part of it.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said his players weren't as physical and aggressive as in previous games.",
      "\u201cOur formula is the same,\u201d he said. \"We have to play a certain way to be successful. We understand our margin for error is not very big. If we deviate from that at all, these are the results that we get.\u201d",
      "Still, midway through the season, West Virginia has beaten three ranked teams, including a nonconference win against Arizona in November, and has already surpassed last year's win total.",
      "Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said he's impressed with how Darian DeVries has turned West Virginia around with an entirely new roster, especially considering the injuries.",
      "\u201cI mean, you win some of these close games, you beat an Arizona, you beat a Gonzaga, you beat Kansas. Are you kidding me?\" Lloyd said. \"If I was that guy\u2019s agent, I would have two more years in that contract right now.\u201d",

      "While there are a few examples of fill-in rookies getting the nod in the playoffs, this will be just the fourth time that two rookie quarterbacks start in the same postseason after making at least six starts during the regular season.",
      "It last happened in 2012 when Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson all got playoff starts. The other times came in 2008 with Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco, and 1983 with Hall of Famers John Elway and Dan Marino.",
      "Only seven rookie quarterbacks have won playoff starts and there's never been a year when more than one did it. A rookie quarterback has never started in the Super Bowl with Brock Purdy (2022), Mark Sanchez (2009), Flacco (2008), Ben Roethlisberger (2004) and Shaun King (1999) all losing in the conference title game.",
      "Daniels and Nix have already had barrier-breaking seasons with both QBs winning at least 10 starts, producing at least 30 touchdowns rushing and passing, and accounting for at least 4,000 yards of offense on the ground and through the air.",

      "That includes four members of the 2018 draft class with Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson all having made the playoffs. This is the fifth time four QBs from the same draft class started in the same postseason with the 2018 class also doing it last season with Mason Rudolph getting the nod instead of Darnold.",
      "This year\u2019s version of the playoffs will have a familiar look.",
      "Ten of the teams that made the postseason are back after getting there last season with only Denver, Minnesota, Washington and the Chargers breaking through after missing out in 2023.",
      "The four newcomers are tied for the fewest since the NFL expanded to 12 playoff teams in 1990 with that last happening in 2015. The four previous seasons with 14 playoff teams featured at least six newcomers each season with seven new teams qualifying in 2022 and eight in 2020.",
      "All four division winners in the AFC are repeat champions with Kansas City (nine straight), Buffalo (five), Baltimore (two) and Houston (two) all going back-to-back. The only other times since the 2002 realignment that all four division winners in a conference repeated came in the 2019 AFC and the 2012 AFC.",
      "Tampa Bay won its fourth straight NFC South title and Detroit won its second straight in the NFC North, marking the third time there were six repeat division winners. It previously happened in 2012 and 2014.",
      "When it came to individual accomplishments, few teams fared better than the Cincinnati Bengals. It just didn't lead to success on the field.",
      "Ja'Marr Chase became the fifth player since the 1970 merger to win a receiving Triple Crown, leading the NFL in catches, yards receiving and TD receptions.",
      "Joe Burrow led the league in yards passing and TD passes, while Trey Hendrickson had the most sacks.",
      "No team had ever had the individual leaders in all of those categories but it didn't help the Bengals, who finished 9-8 and missed the playoffs.",
      "Posting a winning record once again wasn't good enough for the Seattle Seahawks to make the playoffs.",
      "A year after going 9-8 but missing out on the final wild-card spot to Green Bay on the strength of victory tiebreaker, the Seahawks were done in again by that seldom used tiebreaker.",
      "Seattle tied the Rams for first in the NFC West at 10-7 after splitting the season series. The teams also had identical records in the division, against common opponents and in conference games. The Rams came out ahead because the teams they beat combined for two more wins than the teams the Seahawks beat.",
      "Seattle became just the second 10-win team to miss the playoffs since the seventh team was added in each conference in 2020, with Miami also falling short after going 10-6 in 2020. Twelve other teams that won at least 10 games missed the postseason from 1990-2019, when there were six playoff teams per conference.",
      "The Seahawks became the fourth team to miss the playoffs in back-to-back seasons with winning records since 2000, with Cincinnati also falling short after going 9-8 for the second straight season. Miami came up short twice in back-to-back winning seasons, missing out on the postseason in 2002-03 and 2020-21.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers are stumbling into the postseason.",

      "Pittsburgh is just the third team to enter the playoffs on a losing streak of at least four games and the first to do it since Detroit in 1999. The Lions snuck in as a wild-card team at 8-8 that season and then lost 27-13 to Washington.",
      "The 1986 New York Jets were more similar to the Steelers, getting off to a 10-1 start before losing their final five games. New York recovered to beat Kansas City in the wild-card game before losing in double overtime at Cleveland in the divisional round.",
      "Pittsburgh has another losing streak to worry about, having lost five straight playoff games starting with the 2016 AFC title game at New England. A loss to the Ravens would leave the Steelers tied with the fourth longest playoff losing streak ever, trailing only Detroit (nine), Cincinnati (eight) and Kansas City (eight).",

      "And with that, the indoor golf competition that Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy had envisioned for years was finally underway.",
      "TGL had its debut match Tuesday night, with Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Xander Schauffele of New York Golf Club taking on Shane Lowry, Wyndham Clark and Aberg of The Bay Golf Club in the opener. The 15-hole match took just under two hours, which is exactly how TGL envisioned this to work. Final score: The Bay 9, New York 2.",
      "\u201cThe last time I've had that much fun was probably last September,\u201d Lowry said, turning toward Clark as he said that \u2014 the obvious reference being how he and Aberg were part of the European Ryder Cup team that beat Clark and the United States in the fall of 2023.",
      "Yes, trash talk is part of TGL as well \u2014 even among teammates.",
      "\u201cLook, I had an amazing two hours,\u201d Lowry said.",
      "Lowry struck the first shot at 9:15 p.m. Four minutes later, the first hole in TGL history was complete when Aberg rolled in a 9-footer for the first point in league play. Yes, it moves that quickly.",
      "\u201cThis was just a dream conjured up,\u201d Woods said on the ESPN broadcast. \u201cRory and I were talking about it; it's hard to believe that dream came into reality and we were able to take golf into another stratosphere, really.\u201d",

      "The venue is a 250,000-square-foot facility at Palm Beach State College. Players hit some shots into a video screen, some off real grass, some off turf, and the bunkers are not just real sand \u2014 it's sand from Augusta National Golf Club, the same sand Woods has at his home practice facility. It's super-high-tech, with data collected off every shot.",
      "\u201cNobody had more fun than us,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Players wore microphones, there were betting options and fans surrounded the \u201ccourse\u201d in an intimate arena where music blared and noise was welcomed.",
      "\u201cA glorified man cave in a way,\u201d Fowler said.",
      "Once teams moved within 50 yards of the pin, they headed to a short-game complex \u2014 with a green that sits on a 41-yard-wide turntable and has about 600 devices underneath to change the contours. Players said it was difficult to make putts, which might be understandable.",
      "Fans cheered. And they booed \u2014 a little, anyway. Schauffele heard those after he botched a chip, part of a night where not much went right for his team.",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- After some uncertainty, the Tampa Bay Rays now support a $55.7 million city plan to repair hurricane-shredded Tropicana Field in time for the 2026 season opener, while the team prepares to play this year at the New York Yankees' spring training home in nearby Tampa.",
      "Matt Silverman, the Rays' co-president, said in an email to the St. Petersburg chief administrator that the team wants to \u201cclear up\u201d any questions about its support for the reconstruction. The city must pay for the work under its current contract with the Rays.",
      "\u201cWhile we had been open to considering a scenario in which the city bought out of its obligation to rebuild the ballpark, the Rays support and expect the city to rebuild Tropicana Field in accordance with the terms of the current use agreement,\u201d Silverman wrote.",
      "Hurricane Milton tore the Trop's fabric roof to pieces when it came ashore Oct. 9, causing water and other damage to interior parts of the now-exposed ballpark. Work has been ongoing to ensure no further damage is caused by weather but there had been questions about the full repair in part because it would eventually be torn down to make way for a new, $1.3 billion ballpark under current plans to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg another 30 years.",
      "Time is of the essence, Silverman said in his Dec. 30 email to the city, which released it Monday. Even a partial 2026 season at Tropicana Field \u201cwould present massive logistical and revenue challenges for the team,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt is therefore critical that the rebuild start in earnest as soon as possible\" with a realistic construction schedule to be ready by opening day 2026, he added.",
      "The city had no immediate comment on the email. Its own architect presented the repair proposal initially on Dec. 12 but it has not yet been fully approved. Members of the city council have balked at the cost, especially with residents and businesses still recovering from Milton and Hurricane Helene before that.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch has said that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds should cover the bulk of the cost. Silverman said Major League Baseball has told the team it will hire its own advisor to monitor the repair work and timeline.",
      "The planned new downtown Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by the construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "The Rays are preparing to play 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' 11,000-seat spring training location in Tampa. Once Tropicana Field is repaired, Silverman acknowledged the Rays are obligated to play there three more seasons under the contract with St. Petersburg.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to a grand reopening,\u201d Silverman said.",

      "Novak Djokovic says he still feels a bit of trauma when he travels to Australia",
      "Novak Djokovic said he still feels \u201ca bit of trauma\u201d when he travels to Australia, stemming from his deportation in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of times that I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration, I had a bit of trauma from three years ago,\" Djokovic said in an interview with Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper published Monday, ahead of the Australian Open. \u201cAnd some traces still stay there when I\u2019m passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is approaching.\u201d",
      "Djokovic, who has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam championships at Melbourne Park, continued: \u201cThe person checking my passport \u2014 are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.\u201d",
      "Back in 2022, Djokovic sought, and initially obtained, an exemption that would allow him into the Australian Open \u2014 and the country \u2014 even though there were strict rules requiring shots to protect against the coronavirus. But after his flight landed, he was detained at the airport, his visa was canceled and he was sent to an immigration hotel.",
      "A judge later reinstated the visa and ordered Djokovic\u2019s release, ruling he wasn\u2019t given enough time to speak to his lawyers. Australia\u2019s immigration minister then took away the visa again, based on \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Djokovic\u2019s appeal of that ruling was denied by a three-judge panel, and he was deported. He faced a possible three-year ban from the country as someone whose visa was revoked, but Australia had a change of government, its pandemic border rules changed and a new immigration minister granted Djokovic a visa in 2023 \u2014 when he went on to claim the trophy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hold any resentment, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic told the Herald Sun about the saga. \u201cI don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d",
      "The Australian Open begins Sunday (Saturday EST), and Djokovic will be pursuing his 11th trophy in Melbourne to add to his men's record and an unprecedented 25th major singles title overall.",
      "A year ago, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner.",
      "\u201cI just hope to, before I retire, get at least one more title there,\" said the 37-year-old Djokovic, whose only triumph at a tournament in 2024 was his singles gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics in August.",
      "Djokovic opened 2025 at the Brisbane International last week, losing in the quarterfinals to Reilly Opelka.",
      "At the Australian Open, Djokovic will be playing in his first event alongside new coach Andy Murray, his former on-court rival and a three-time major champion who retired as a player after the Summer Games. Murray and Djokovic have said they will partner up through the year's initial Grand Slam tournament.",

    "summary": "Doug Pederson is out as Jacksonville&rsquo;s head coach after the franchise&rsquo;s &ldquo;best team assembled&rdquo; won just four games",
    "story": [
      "Doug Pederson is out as Jacksonville\u2019s head coach after the franchise\u2019s \u201cbest team assembled\u201d won just four games",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Pederson and general manager Trent Baalke never developed enough synergy, if any at all.",
      "Pederson thought talent was Jacksonville's bigger issue as losses mounted; Baalke believed coaching was the problem. Regardless, the pairing wasn't working in Year 3 \u2014 and everyone inside the building knew it.",
      "Jaguars owner Shad Khan could have justified a complete overhaul. Instead, the billionaire businessman settled for choosing between the duo. He opted for Baalke, a questionable decision that could affect who becomes Jacksonville\u2019s next head coach.",
      "Khan fired Pederson on Monday, a day after a 26-23 overtime loss at Indianapolis. It was the team\u2019s 18th loss in its last 23 games. More surprising, he kept Baalke.",
      "Khan made the move with one year remaining on Pederson\u2019s contract and more than five months after the owner stood in front of coaches and players and declared this the \u201cbest team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever.\"",
      "\u201cWinning now\u201d was Khan\u2019s edict as training camp opened and after he committed nearly half a billion dollars to signing quarterback Trevor Lawrence, pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen and cornerback Tyson Campbell to long-term deals in the offseason. It was the most expensive stretch of roster building in franchise history.",
      "And Khan has gotten little return on his investment.",
      "\u201cAs much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded,\u201d Khan said in a statement. \"In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now.",
      "\u201cI strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago.\"",
      "Pederson, who led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl title in 2018, finished 9-8 in his first two campaigns in Jacksonville and made the playoffs in his first year. He became the first coach in franchise history to start with back-to-back winning seasons and was a welcome relief following Urban Meyer\u2019s 13-game tenure that was filled with dysfunction.",
      "But Pederson\u2019s injury-riddled team went 1-5 down the stretch in 2023 and missed the postseason after spending nearly two months atop the AFC South. He thought getting Lawrence healthy and revamping his defensive staff would change the team\u2019s fortunes. Neither made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt's unfortunate because at the end of the day we all had a hand in it,\u201d receiver Christian Kirk said. \u201cI have a ton of respect for Doug. He\u2019s made me a better football player, better man. I think he\u2019s one of the better coaches to have coached in this league, and it\u2019s just unfortunate the way that things went.\u201d",
      "More damning: Pederson failed to develop Lawrence or create a team identity, handed play-calling duties to Press Taylor despite Khan making his wishes known and showed no urgency to try to fix a defense that regressed under new coordinator Ryan Nielsen.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that have gone into our season,\u201d tight end Evan Engram said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the coaching. It's not just one part of it. It's everybody. I\u2019ve been in this league for a while. I try not to get into the whole that side of it, so definitely it\u2019s always unfortunate when most changes do come.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars (4-13) finished with their 10th losing season in Khan\u2019s 13 years as owner. Now, Khan will hire his sixth head coach; current NFL offensive coordinators Ben Johnson (Detroit) and Liam Coen (Tampa Bay) should top the list. But would they even agree to work with Baalke, whose draft picks have been mostly suspect and his latest free-agent class is among the worst in franchise history?",
      "The 56-year-old Pederson went 23-30 with Jacksonville, a far cry from the Super Bowl-winning coach Khan thought he hired in February 2021.",
      "His tenure with Jacksonville was mostly forgettable. Sure, there was the come-from-behind stunner over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC wild-card round in January 2023 in which Lawrence rallied the Jaguars from a 27-0 deficit and won 31-30. Otherwise, Pederson was fairly pedestrian.",
      "His ultimate undoing came in close games, with Jacksonville going 3-10 in one-score contests this season. Whether that\u2019s talent or coaching is debatable. Regardless, Pederson got little public support from players down the stretch, a clear sign that the locker room was ready for a different direction.",
      "Now Khan has to find the right coach to get Lawrence \u2014 and the rest of the team \u2014 to another level. It also will have to be someone amenable to working with Baalke, whose coaching list includes Jim Harbaugh (2011-14), Jim Tomsula (2015), Chip Kelly (2022), Meyer (2021) and Pederson (2022-24).",

    "summary": "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
    "story": [
      "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
      "MIAMI -- Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months. The Miami Heat president has not revealed any retirement timetable. He still wears impeccable suits, shakes hands with as firm of a grip as anyone, knows all eyes are on him when he walks into just about any room.",
      "He's not stopping. Or changing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a rock. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s the Godfather,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last month. \"That\u2019s why we all kill ourselves for this culture. It's because of him. We believe in him.\u201d",
      "And, as some have learned over the years, clashing with Riley doesn't always end well.",
      "Jimmy Butler's in-progress breakup with the Heat \u2014 Miami didn't give him an extension, Butler wants a trade, the franchise suspended him for seven games for conduct detrimental to the team, and here we are \u2014 is not the first time that a superstar has been in Miami but had his time with Riley's team come to an unceremonious end.",
      "Dwyane Wade left (but returned). LeBron James left. Shaquille O'Neal got traded. All of those situations \u2014 and Butler's, as well \u2014 are different in plenty of ways. But the parallel in them in that Riley will only do what he thinks is best for the Heat.",
      "\u201cI know from personal experience,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in his role as an analyst on TNT last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t bicker with Pat Riley.\u201d",
      "A look at those situations:",
      "How they got here: Butler was eligible for a $113 million, two-year extension last summer. The Heat didn't offer it, so this dispute is largely about money.",
      "There's more to it, of course.",
      "Butler is not an easy guy to deal with, which is not a knock on him nor is it a bad thing. He's headstrong, driven, says what he thinks, doesn't really care what you think, does the work and plays to win. It was a perfect fit for the Heat, who like to say that they're not for everybody. Neither is Butler.",
      "Riley made two comments last spring that Butler surely didn't like: that he \u2014 and all of Miami's best-paid players \u2014 need to play more often, and that Butler shouldn't have talked about beating teams still in the playoffs when the Heat were not. (Butler made a comment about how if he wasn't hurt the Heat would have beaten Boston and New York in the postseason; Riley didn't like that he said that.)",
      "Butler has said for years that he only wants to be wanted. Evidently, he did not feel wanted in Miami any longer.",
      "There were a lot of factors in this story. Money was not the only issue, but it was among them.",
      "Wade thought about leaving in the summer of 2015 before he and the team agreed on a one-year, $20 million contract. A year later, the Heat offered Wade every dollar they had available \u2014 about $42 million for two years. Chicago offered about $47 million. And that was that.",
      "Chicago is Wade's hometown. Ironically, Butler was on that Bulls team that Wade was joining; Wade played a big role in convincing Butler to go to Miami in 2019. Eventually, whatever hard feelings existed between Wade and Heat went away; he finished his career in Miami and the team rewarded him with a statue earlier this season.",
      "Riley was contrite when Wade left.",
      "\u201cThat is where we both failed ... I more than he, because he\u2019s the asset, he\u2019s the star, he\u2019s the face of the franchise,\u201d Riley said at that time. \u201cI should have done everything that I could have verbally in trying to change his mindset to mine, a big picture, a better picture, or one that I thought would help him.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Wade's longtime agent, Henry Thomas, died. Riley was part of the Heat contingent that went to the funeral. He and Wade hugged. A couple weeks later, Miami swung a deal with Cleveland \u2014 Wade had moved on from Chicago \u2014 to bring the franchise's all-time scoring leader back to Miami.",
      "\u201cIt ended the way it was supposed to end,\u201d Wade said in his final days as a Heat player.",
      "O'Neal was traded to Miami in 2004. Two years later, the Heat won a title. Two years after that, they were broken down, Wade was hurt, and the team was headed to the bottom of the NBA.",
      "O'Neal didn't want to be in Miami anymore. He got traded to Phoenix. Initially, the breakup was not exactly amicable; over time, wounds were healed on both sides. O'Neal's number hangs from the rafters and he's welcomed back like a long-lost hero every time he's in Miami for a game.",
      "\u201cIt was not personal,\u201d Riley said when the team retired O'Neal's jersey in 2016. \u201cShaq was impeccable with his word. He came down here and said \u2018We\u2019re gonna win a title, Coach.\u2019 And we won a title. ... No hard feelings, at all. I\u2019m an Irishman and I forgive.\u201d",
      "There are a ton of theories about why James left the Heat after four years, four runs to the NBA Finals and two championships in Miami.",
      "Was everything perfect? No. But when the Heat lost the 2014 finals to San Antonio, ending their two-year reign as NBA champions, James was on the verge of free agency. It was widely believed that he would strongly consider leaving.",
      "\u201cYou've got to stay together \u2014 if you've got the guts \u2014 and you don't find the first door and run out of it,\u201d Riley said in a now-infamous speech a few days after that season ended.",
      "A couple weeks later, James made it official: He was going back to Cleveland.",
      "\u201cWhen I became a free agent in 2010, I felt what was best for me was to go to Miami,\u201d James would say in that first season back in Cleveland. \u201cAnd when I became a free agent once again this past summer, I thought what was best was going back home.\u201d",
      "And James' Heat fans are still fans. James got a huge ovation when he returned to Miami for the first time as an opponent \u2014 and still does a decade later. Riley announced years ago that James' number will also be retired by the Heat.",

      "Except for one second-quarter play that could be a major problem for the Ravens' dynamic offense.",
      "Zay Flowers, the team's top receiver, went down with a knee injury and didn't return to the game Saturday. Coach John Harbaugh sounded somewhat optimistic afterward but said there would be an MRI.",
      "Baltimore finished the regular season 12-5 despite dropping its first two games. It's just one game worse than the record that gave the Ravens the league's best mark in 2023, but this time there will be no first-round bye. Baltimore will be the No. 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.",
      "So Flowers doesn't have much time to recover. The Pro Bowl receiver caught 74 passes for 1,059 yards and four touchdowns in the regular season.",
      "Baltimore trailed Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North with four to play. Then the Ravens went 4-0 and the Steelers went 0-4 the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week-to-week league, and you really just have to take it one week at a time, one day at a time, one play at time, and our guys have done a really good job of holding onto that,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat 1-0 T-shirt that we all wear around is real, and so, four wins later, we\u2019re the AFC North champions.\u201d",
      "You wouldn't think there'd be enough plays or enough footballs or enough yards on the field for both Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to put up these numbers, but here are the final totals for the regular season. For Jackson: 4,172 yards passing and 915 rushing. For Henry: 1,921 yards rushing.",
      "The Ravens became the first team in NFL history with 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 rushing in one season. Obviously, the regular season is a bit longer now than it used to be \u2014 but Jackson and Henry both seem to have made each other better, and they've taken the offense to another level.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve won four in a row. I feel like everybody\u2019s been doing a great job of doing their jobs so we can execute on offense, and it\u2019s been fun,\" Henry said. \"We\u2019ve got to keep it going, stay locked in (and) hold each other accountable so we keep that same momentum in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "The wide receiver group could be thin if Flowers is limited. Rashod Bateman had a good game against Cleveland, and so did the tight end tandem of Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, but receiver Tylan Wallace played 51 offensive snaps and finished with one target and no catches.",
      "Michael Pierce's first career interception was a late highlight in this game, and it also underscored how healthy he looks after four games back from an injured reserve stint.",
      "Pierce, listed at 355 pounds, had some running room on his interception but was about 80 yards from the end zone and gave himself up with a slide.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of turning big-guy interceptions and fumbles into memes, so at the risk of turning myself into one of those, I decided it was just time to go home,\u201d he said. \"Plus, I was out of gas, so it was good.\u201d",
      "Defensive back Brandon Stephens was targeted with some success by the Browns, and he can expect similar treatment in the playoffs after all the big defensive plays teammates Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins have made.",
      "Bateman and safety Kyle Hamilton were both shaken up but returned to the field, so Flowers is the lone significant injury concern coming out of the game for the Ravens.",
      "Baltimore's last two games of the regular season were its best in terms of total yards allowed. The Ravens allowed just 211 in a 31-2 win at Houston, then 230 against the Browns.",
      "Baltimore's first-round playoff opponent depended on the result of the Chargers-Raiders game Sunday. The Ravens will host either the Chargers or the Steelers.",

      "BRISTOL, England -- U.S. rugby star Ilona Maher made her debut for the Bristol Bears women's team in front of a record home crowd of 9,240 fans on Sunday.",
      "But Maher, \u201c the most followed rugby player on the planet,\u201d could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women\u2019s Rugby match.",
      "She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field.",
      "The previous attendance record for a Bristol women\u2019s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher's debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats.",
      "The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays.",
      "Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the \u201cDancing With The Stars\" TV show.",
      "The Vermont native is returning to the 15-a-side game in hopes of boosting her chances of making the U.S. team for the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. She can play at wing or center.",

League-leading Harlequins said they set a women\u2019s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium.

      "Dorsey and Dickerson were informed of the moves in the aftermath of the team's 35-10 loss in Baltimore on Saturday.",

      "Dickerson had replaced Bill Callahan when he joined his son Brian's staff in Tennessee.",

      "Justus Annunen made 31 saves a night after Juuse Saros stopped 27 shots in a 3-0 victory iin Vancouver. Rookie center Fedor Svechkov also scored and had an assist for his first career multi-point game. Filip Forsberg had two assists.",
      "Mikael Backlund scored for Calgary, and Dustin Wolf made 24 saves. The Flames have lost consecutive games for the first time since November.",
      "O\u2019Reilly opened the scoring on the power play at 4:21 of the second, lifting a puck over Wolf from in close after Svechkov worked the puck out front from behind the net.",
      "Nashville: After making his NHL debut in Vancouver on Friday, 22-year-old Ozzy Wiesblatt was back in the lineup for Nashville in the city in which he played his minor hockey. Supportive signs adorned the glass during warmups while friends and family looked on.",
      "Flames: It was a hard luck return to the lineup for struggling winger Andrei Kuzmenko, a scratch in seven of the previous eight games. A 39-goal scorer two years ago but stuck at just one this season, Kuzmenko was in the penalty box for both Predators\u2019 power-play markers as they built a 2-0 lead. His second infraction was for playing with a broken stick.",
      "With Calgary down 1-0 and the sides playing four aside, a defensive zone turnover gave Jonathan Huberdeau a clean breakaway, but Calgary\u2019s leading goal scorer was turned away by Annunen. Just over a minute later, O\u2019Reilly made it 2-0.",
      "Calgary gave up a power-play goal for the sixth consecutive game.",

It has been a tough few weeks. That has to be our focus right now.\u201d",

Wilson completed just one pass in the third quarter as Cincinnati dominated time of possession by 16 minutes.

      "New research shows about a quarter of animals living in rivers, lakes and other freshwater sources are threatened with extinction",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nearly a quarter of animals living in rivers, lakes and other freshwater sources are threatened with extinction, according to new research published Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",
      "The researchers examined around 23,500 species of dragonflies, fish, crabs and other animals that depend exclusively on freshwater ecosystems. They found that 24% were at risk of extinction \u2013 classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered \u2013 due to compounding threats from pollution, dams, water extraction, agriculture, invasive species, climate change and other disruptions.",
      "\u201cMost species don\u2019t have just one threat putting them at risk of extinction, but many threats acting together,\u201d said Sayer, a study-co-author.",
      "The tally, published in the journal Nature, is the first that time researchers have analyzed the global risk to freshwater species. Previous studies have focused on land animals including including mammals, birds and reptiles.",
      "Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study, called it \u201ca long-awaited and hugely important paper.\"",
      "\u201cAlmost every big river in North America and Europe is massively modified\" through damming, putting freshwater species at risk, he said.",
      "In South America, the vast Amazon River ecosystem also faces threats from deforestation, wildfires and illegal gold mining, said Charvet.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company show the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "And Hyundai Mobis isn't the only one giving the view from cars' front seats a makeover. BMW also showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X this week.",
      "BMW's iDrive will soon be featured in all of new models that will hit the market starting at the end of this year. The system projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen \u2014 controlled by a touchscreen below and voice commands \u2014 and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of election vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, questions also emerged about how many new features are too many features.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely easy to get a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of technology in cars ... especially when you have cars that have three, four, five (or) six different touchscreens that offer different interfaces,\u201d said Tim Stevens, an automotive analyst and freelance journalist who attended CES this week.",
      "But, Stevens added, this also shows how promising the integration of technology like AI can be \u2014 such as with in-car voice assistants. If you can \u201chave a conversation with your car\u201d to ask for detailed directions or restaurant suggestions, he explains, that can reduce distractions like trying to reach for your phone.",
      "In addition to in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week also put a spotlight on the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand access sources for consumers. In addition to a previously-announced venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America, Honda on Tuesday said it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "CES, the annual trade show of all-things tech, is upon us",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CES, the annual trade show of all things tech, is upon us.",
      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",

      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two deadly incidents on New Year's Day \u2014 an attack being investigated as an act of terrorism in New Orleans and an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 both involved vehicles that were rented on Turo, a peer-to-peer car sharing company.",
      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.",
      "Turo said it is \u201cshocked and saddened\" Wednesday's events and that \u201cour hearts are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "The company added that is \"outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\u201d",
      "While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has said that is has found \u201cno definitive link\u201d between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.",
      "Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or \u201cguests.\u201d \u201cHosts\u201d set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.",
      "Billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest car sharing marketplace\" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 13:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "Zibby and Kyle Owens, who own a home in Pacific Palisades but also reside in New York, sat down with Diane Macedo on ABC News Live on Wednesday morning, showcasing footage from their Google Nest camera that reveals the devastating flames. The camera faces their backyard, with the fire engulfing the surrounding area and moving closer to their pool.",
      "\"This is the worst-case scenario playing out in front of our eyes right now,\" Kyle Owens said. \"It's not just a place, it's a beautiful community.\"",
      "The video was the last contact the Owens received from their home since they lost power shortly afterward.",
      "Fires are common in California, and the Owens said they are not new to this experience. The couple recently evacuated from a New Year's Eve fire that started with fireworks. However, these particularly powerful Santa Ana wind gusts, which allow the fire to burn five football fields per minute, concerned Kyle Owens about the future of this community.",
      "\"If we're able to go back at some point, I don't know what we are going back to,\" Kyle Owens said.",
      "Kyle Owens also discussed how Pacific Palisades, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the area, is particularly difficult to evacuate due to its hillside homes and winding streets. Many friends waited over three hours to get down the mountain, a drive that would normally take around two minutes.",
      "Two other Pacific Palisades residents, Kenny and Tricia Rakusin, who live along the coastline, said they also struggled to escape the fire zone as a buildup of vehicles trying to travel the hill toward Pacific Coast Highway clogged the road. Tricia Rakusin said her daughter also witnessed many people forced to abandon their cars along Sunset Boulevard.",
      "\"This neighborhood has been in place for decades, there's never been a fire anywhere close to where we live,\" Tricia Rakusin said. \"No one has ever conceived the possibility of this.\"",
      "Along with the stress of the destructive flames and imminent damage, Tricia Rakusin said their insurance canceled all policies in their area four months ago.",
      "\"When we go up there, it will be from a war zone,\" Kenny Rakusin said. \"The unknown is really challenging.\"",
      "As of now, the Pacific Palisades fire, which is among two other fires in LA County, has grown to at least 11,000 acres and is zero percent contained.",
      "On top of the uncertainty of their home's condition, the Owens worry the flames could travel to Zibby's bookshop in Santa Monica, which is also under an evacuation warning. For the Owens and many others, these flames are wiping away businesses and homes full of memories and connection.",
      "\"There is so much soul to the neighborhood,\" Zibby Owens said. \"It's unthinkable that this place could vanish.\"",

      "Biden, who pardoned his son, Hunter, in December, said he has not decided whether to issue more preemptive pardons for potential Trump targets before leaving office in less than two weeks. When Biden and Trump met in the Oval Office after the election, Biden urged Trump not to follow through on his threats to target his opponents.",

      "\"We are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing administration, and they're trying everything they can to make it more difficult,\" Trump said, contending they were not facilitating a \"smooth transition.\"",
      "On Biden's oil drilling ban, Trump vowed: \"I will reverse it immediately. It'll be done immediately. And we will drill baby drill,\" but that could prove very difficult because the Biden ban is considered permanent under the law and Congress would need to change it.",

      "\"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump also floated the possibility of imposing tariffs \u201cat a very high level\u201d on Denmark to acquire Greenland, claiming Denmark might not have any \u201clegal right\u201d to Greenland. As Trump spoke, his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was in Greenland for what he claimed was a personal visit.",
      "Trump also didn't mince words in criticizing former President Jimmy Carter, who died last week at the age of 100, for overseeing the Panama Canal Treaty that gave the Central American nation eventual control of the critical waterway.",
      "Trump called Carter a \"good man\" but said he believed ceding the Panama Canal is why Carter didn't win a second term. The comments came as Carter's remains were being transported from Georgia to Washington ahead of his state funeral.",

      "He also again falsely claimed that no one in the crowd carried firearms.",

      "\"The Republican Party will not cut benefits,\" the House speaker told reporters.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that cuts to Social Security and Medicare won't be part of the legislative package being worked out to fund President-elect Donald Trump's agenda.",
      "\"No, the president has made clear that Social Security and Medicare have to be preserved,\" Johnson replied when asked if he was open to cutting the programs as part of the spending plans being worked out between House and Senate Republican leaders. \"We have to look at all spending while maintaining\u2026 The Republican Party will not cut benefits.\"",
      "Johnson said he was to meet with Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday to discuss ideas for a funding package that Republicans plan to pursue through \"reconciliation\" -- a fast-track process limited to spending and revenue legislation that needs only a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to pass legislation. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House and a 3-seat majority in the Senate.",
      "Congressional Republicans have yet to decide on a reconciliation plan. Johnson is pushing Trump's desire for \"one big, beautiful bill\" to fund his agenda but Senate leaders and some conservatives in the House prefer that it be divided into two pieces of legislation.",
      "The negotiated package is expected to include several of Trump's top priorities, which include extending the tax cuts passed during his first term and addressing his immigration reforms, including more funding for Border Patrol and ICE. Trump has also pushed Congress to increase or eliminate the debt limit, though details of any plan remain unclear.",
      "Trump reiterated his preference for one bill when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday, but said he could live with two.",
      "\"Well, I like one big, beautiful bill, and I always have, I always will, he said. But if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early.\"",
      "Before Trump spoke, Johnson said he remains convinced that the one-bill strategy is the \"best way to go.\"",
      "\"I'm meeting today with Leader Thune about the two ideas,\" Johnson told reporters outside a closed GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning. \"We still remain convinced over here that the one-bill strategy is the best way to go, but there's some senators who have different ideas.\"",
      "\"They're all dear friends and colleagues, and we're going to work on this together. We will get the two chambers united on the same strategy. And I think the president still prefers 'one big, beautiful bill,' as he likes to say, and there's a lot of merit to that -- we could talk about the ins and outs of that maybe at our leadership press conference here.\"",
      "Senate Republican Whip John Barrasso said one of the key objectives in the meeting with Trump will be attempting to forge a clearer path on reconciliation.",
      "\"He's going to be with Senate leadership as well as the entire Senate conference to talk about that exact thing tomorrow and how we get on the same page with the House,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said a two-part plan that would deliver wins for Trump early in his presidency and allow for more time to address tax policy that doesn't expire until the end of the year, but the \"goal is the same.\"",
      "\"It was a suggestion by John Thune -- this was before Christmas -- he said 'Let's get an early win on the border.'

      "Johnson also said he intends to handle the debt limit -- another Trump priority -- in the reconciliation process, which Republicans could try pass in both chambers without Democratic support.",
      "\"That way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we again get to determine the details of that. If it runs through the regular order, regular process\u2026 then you have to have both parties negotiating. And we feel like we are in better stead to do it ourselves,\" he said.",
      "Johnson said members will have \"lengthy\" sessions to go over the plan for reconciliation since there are \"broad opinions\" on how to handle it.",
      "\"Republicans in this majority in the House and Senate \u2013 our intention, our mission is to reduce spending in a meaningful way so we can get, restore fiscal sanity\u2026 so raising the debt limit is a necessary step so we don't give the appearance that we're going to default in some way on the nation's debt,\" he added.",
      "Johnson said this does not mean Republicans will \"tolerate\" spending more to the new debt limit because the \"commitment\" is to reduce spending, but the final formula has not been determined.",
      "The speaker also told reporters that he'll likely speak with Trump on Tuesday, ahead of the president-elect's visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
      "\"I'm sure I'll speak with him today, probably this afternoon, and when he's in town, I'm sure we'll get together,\" Johnson said. \"He and I both have a very busy schedule. He's trying to jam a lot into that visit on the Hill, so we're sympathetic to that.\" Johnson said.",

      "\"He's going to be with Senate leadership as well as the entire Senate conference to talk about that exact thing tomorrow and how we get on the same page with the House,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said today that the \"goal is the same\" regardless of whether Congress ultimately proceeds with a one-part bill, as Speaker Johnson and Trump have suggested, or with a two-part strategy championed by Majority Leader Thune.",
      "But he made the case for a two-part plan that would deliver wins for Trump early in his presidency and allow for more time to address tax policy that doesn't expire until the end of the year.",

      "Senate Republicans have slightly more breathing room on these measures than their House colleagues as they have a 3-seat GOP majority. In the House, Johnson might only be able to afford to lose a single Republican, so his preference for one large bill appears to be focused on getting his members together.",
      "\"If you put a number of high priority issues together, then people are more apt to vote for the larger package, because even though there may be something in it that doesn't meet their preference, they're not going to be willing to vote against the larger measures that are such, such high priority for the American people and for President Trump,\" Johnson told Newsmax on Monday.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 08:54:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Filings by Donald Trump's lawyers suggest that Jack Smith's final report on his two probes could contain details that are potentially damaging to the president-elect.",
    "story": [
      "Judge Aileen Cannon temporarily blocked the release of the report Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have unleashed a legal blitz this week to prevent the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his classified documents and election interference investigations, successfully convincing the federal judge who dismissed Trump's documents case to issue an emergency injunction temporarily blocking the report's release.",
      "While Smith has released many of his findings already -- through four indictments and a lengthy filing outlining the evidence against Trump -- recent disclosures made by attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants suggest that the special counsel's final report could contain previously undisclosed details that are potentially damaging to the president elect.",
      "According to a court filing from Trump's defense lawyers Monday, a draft version of the report asserts that Trump \"engaged in an unprecedented criminal effort,\" violated multiple federal laws, and served as the \"head\" of multiple criminal conspiracies.",
      "Trump's lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who reviewed a draft version of the report over the weekend, argued in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland Monday that the report's release would be a \"partisan weapon\" and \"lawless political stunt, designed to politically harm\" President-elect Trump and his allies.",
      "According to Trump's lawyers, a draft of the report included multiple \"baseless attacks\" on members of Trump's incoming presidential administration that could \"interfere with upcoming confirmation hearings.\"",
      "The letter did not provide any additional information about which, if any, of Trump's nominees or appointees were mentioned in the report.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in 2023 to charges of unlawfully retaining classified materials after leaving the White House, and, in a separate case, pleaded not guilty to charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case this past July after deeming Smith's appointment unconstitutional, leading Smith to appeal that decision.",
      "Smith, who is now winding down both his cases against the president-elect due to a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, has not provided any details about the contents of his report. Smith's team has accused Trump's attorneys of violating a confidentiality agreement by making portions of their findings public in their filings.",
      "Special counsels are mandated by internal Justice Department regulations to prepare confidential reports at the conclusion of their investigations to summarize their findings, and the attorney general can determine whether to release the report publicly. Smith's report includes two volumes, covering his investigation into Trump's alleged retention of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that the report's release would disrupt the ongoing presidential transition process and \"exacerbate stigma and public opprobrium surrounding the Chief Executive,\" suggesting that the report -- which is being prepared by a prosecutor independent from the president -- contradicts the Biden administration's vow to \"facilitate an orderly and collegial transition process.\"",
      "\"It'll be a fake report, just like it was a fake investigation,\" Trump said at a news conference Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Trump's lawyers also suggested that the report included a \"pathetically transparent tirade\" about social media platform X's effort to \"protect civil liberties.\"",
      "ABC News previously reported that X -- then known as Twitter -- was held in contempt and fined $350,000 for failing to comply with a search warrant for records and data from former President Trump's social media account. X's owner, Elon Musk, is now one of Trump's most vocal supporters and advisers, and spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump.",
      "Blanche and Bove -- both of whom Trump has picked for top Justice Department posts in the incoming administration -- have argued that the report's release would only offer a single-sided view of the case and give \"rise to a media storm of false and unfair criticism\" that Trump would need to address during the transition period.",
      "While Trump is no longer being prosecuted by Smith, his two former co-defendants in the classified documents case have argued they would be unable to have a fair trial if the findings are released publicly. Lawyers for Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira have claimed that the report would reveal sensitive grand jury material -- such as communications obtained via a subpoena -- and support the finding that \"everyone Smith charged is guilty of the crimes charged.\"",
      "Describing Smith as a \"rogue actor with a personal and political vendetta,\" lawyers for Trump's co-defendants argued in a filing that the report would irreparably bias the public by amplifying the government's \"narrative\" without providing Trump and his co-defendants the ability to respond.",
      "\"Smith's planned Final Report -- now that he is unshackled from due process requirements that restrained him as a government actor -- would engender the very prejudice, passion, and excitement and be an exercise of the tyrannical power that our court system is designed to insulate against,\" the filing said.",
      "In a brief filing Tuesday, a lawyer on Smith's staff confirmed that the special counsel's office is \"working to finalize\" its report, and said that Garland will have the final say over what material will be made public.",

      "Unauthorized immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes could be be deported.",
      "The House voted at 1 p.m. Tuesday on the Laken Riley Act, passing the bill as its first piece of legislation of the 119th Congress on a vote of 264 to 159.",
      "Forty-eight Democrats voted in favor of the bill.",
      "\u201cLaken Riley was brutally murdered by an illegal alien that President Biden and the Democrats let into this country with their open border policy,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement after the vote. \"It is hard to believe after countless horrific stories like Laken\u2019s, ANY House Democrats would vote against deporting illegal aliens who commit violent crimes against American citizens.",
      "\u201cBut 159 just did, demonstrating some Democrats have ignored the loud and clear message from voters in this election who demanded secure borders, the deportation of violent illegal aliens, and laws that put the safety and security of the American people first,\" he added.",
      "Reintroduced by Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican, the legislation pins Riley's death on the Biden administration's open-border policies and grants power to attorneys general to sue the federal government if they can show their states are being harmed over failure to implement national immigration policies. The measure also allows states to sue the Department of Homeland Security for harm caused to citizens allegedly due to illegal immigration.",
      "The bill was named after Riley, a nursing student who was murdered by illegal immigrant Jose Ibarra while jogging on campus at the University of Georgia. Ibarra was sentenced to life in prison for the murder.",
      "\"The only thing President Biden did after Laken's tragic death was apologize for calling her murderer an illegal,\" Johnson said ahead of the vote. \"That's outrageous. We all know the real victim here was young Laken. There are real consequences to policy decisions. This one was deadly.\"",
      "The House previously passed the bill in March by a vote of 251-170, with 37 Democrats voting in favor. The bill was expected to pass again with bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cHouse Republicans heard the voices of those who wanted change and voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,\" Johnson said Tuesday. \"We will always fight to protect Americans, and today\u2019s success is just the beginning of Republican efforts to undo the catastrophic damage caused by years of the Democrats\u2019 failed leadership.\u201d",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune teed up a procedural vote on the Laken Riley Act, which could occur as soon as this week. It will be one of the first legislative actions taken by the new Senate.",
      "The bill will need 60 votes to advance through the upper chamber. Even with the Republicans' new 53-vote majority, it could prove difficult to court the necessary Democratic support to advance it.",
      "So far, only one Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, is reportedly co-sponsoring the bill, which is being led in the chamber by Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Budd, R-N.C. It is unclear whether there will be requisite Democratic support to clear the Senate.",
      "The Senate, under Democratic leadership last session, never considered the act as a standalone bill. But it previously considered the Laken Riley Act when Senate Republicans forced a vote on it as an amendment to a sweeping government funding package in March. The amendment was considered as a government shutdown loomed, and changes to the bill would have likely forced a government shutdown.",
      "No Democrats voted for it at the time, though it later earned the support of Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who lost reelection to Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy.",

      "The president-elect claims it\u2019s vital for national and economic security.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume later this month, he is ramping up his threats to take over a critical shipping artery and a strategic foreign land -- suggesting he could even use military force to do so.",
      "\"I'm not going to commit to that,\" Trump said on Tuesday when asked if he would rule out using the U.S. military to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "\"It might be that you'll have to do something. Look, the Panama Canal is vital to our country,\" he continued, also saying, \"we need Greenland for national security purposes.\" He added, \"We need them for economic security. The Panama Canal was built for our military.\"",
      "Trump also slammed former President Jimmy Carter for overseeing diplomatic negotiations to turn over the Panama Canal, which the U.S. finished constructing in 1914 and controlled until Jimmy Carter ceded authority in 1977 with the Panama Canal Treaty.",
      "\"The Panama Canal is a disgrace. What took place at the Panama Canal? Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1, and they were supposed to treat us well. I thought it was a terrible thing to do,\" Trump said.",
      "Despite Trump's focus on expanding American territory, his strategy for achieving his objectives remains hazy -- and many of the claims the president-elect provided to rationalize the takeovers range from arguable to dubious, experts say.",
      "They broadly agree that Greenland holds an important strategic location and is rich in lithium, graphite and other minerals. However, the world's largest island is already host to a U.S. military base and a longstanding treaty gives Washington significant control over Greenland's defense. Greenland and Denmark are also NATO allies.",
      "\"People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it. But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world. I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" Trump said.",
      "On Panama, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the canal is \"run by China,\" and that U.S. ships are charged more than vessels operated by other countries to cross through it.",
      "\"They don't treat us fairly. They charge more for our ships than they charge for ships of other countries. They charge more for our Navy than they charge for navies of other countries,\" he complained. \"They laugh at us because they think we're stupid, but we're not stupid anymore.\"",
      "In reality, the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) -- which is controlled by the Panamanian government -- operates the waterway, and 1977 diplomatic treaty with the U.S. mandates that all countries must be allowed to use it for \"peaceful transit\" and that there be \"no discrimination against any nation, or its citizens or subjects, concerning the conditions or charges.\"",
      "Accordingly, the tariffs and tolls associated with crossing the canal are determined by the size and type of the vessel and the cargo it carries -- not the flag the ship sails under. While the costs associated with using the waterway have risen in recent years, limits imposed on the canal's capacity due to a historic drought are behind the price hike.",
      "China's expanding influence in Panama and across Central America more broadly has sparked concern on both sides of the aisle, but the same 1977 treaty authorizes the U.S. to intervene if the canal's neutrality is jeopardized.",
      "Authorizing a military intervention with the intent of taking over the Panama Canal -- or Greenland -- is another matter.",
      "Authorities of Panama and Greenland have repeatedly said they won't hand over any territory to Trump, with Panama's president declaring that the canal \"is going to stay in our hands forever,\" and Denmark's prime minister insisting \"Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the sole ability to declare war on a foreign power, and -- once the war is declared -- gives the president wide-ranging authority to execute the conflict.",
      "But presidents have often used military force without congressional approval, including against Panama.",
      "In December 1989, former President George H.W. Bush launched an invasion of Panama to overthrow the country's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Noriega. The intervention, which was widely supported by the American public at the time, set Panama on a path toward democracy -- but was condemned by the United Nations as a violation of international law.",
      "Trump has also said he could use economic pressure to force countries to capitulate to his agenda, including Canada, which the president-elect has repeatedly said should become the 51st state.",
      "\"Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,\" Trump said.",
      "Canada's outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to Trump's statements in a post on X, writing \"there isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\"",
      "\"Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner,\" he said.",
      "Congress has delegated much of its foreign economic authority to the White House, but the biggest speed bump impeding Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada may be a trade deal negotiated under Trump himself: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).",
      "The USMCA -- which is not due for review until 2026 -- allows any member to withdraw from it but requires that the exiting country wait six months before rescinding benefits to other parties.",
      "The president-elect's clearest path to fulfilling one of his promises to redraw the world map may be renaming the Gulf of Mexico, which he vowed to change to \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "\"What a beautiful name,\" he said. \"And it's appropriate.\"",

      "\"The claim is so baseless that there is no support for an automatic stay here,\" said Steven Wu of the Manhattan district attorney's office. \"There is a compelling public interest in seeing this process come to an end.\"",

      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "\u201cEssentially, this is a question of if a precedent is set for a deposition of an attorney general in this case, it would be open season for lawfare and the weaponization of the public records act for witchhunts by everybody,\u201d Hendershot said.",
      "The center initially requested the documents in March 2020, including records associated with RAGA's winter meeting of that year.",
      "Yost responded at the time that his office had no pertinent records to turn over or that the information being sought wasn\u2019t a record. As part of a legal challenge by the center, a Tenth District magistrate ordered his office to answer a series of questions about the communications and subsequently directed him to produce certain documents for private, in-camera review.",
      "The lower court said a review of the requested materials would help it determine whether they were public records or not \u2014 dependent on factors such as whether the communications were carried out on state time, were conducted by public employees or involved Yost\u2019s official duties.",
      "Yost appealed the magistrate's orders to the state's high court, arguing in part that searching for the requested records would potentially reach into the communications of Republican attorneys general in other states as well as his own staff\u2019s personal and campaign email accounts.",
      "He has also said that the discovery could potentially sweep in irrelevant information having nothing to do with RAGA or its fundraising arm, such as communications about multistate lawsuits his office might be involved in, say, against an e-cigarette maker or Google.",
      "Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy asked Wednesday whether the lower court\u2019s order might be asking too much of the state \u2014 for it to produce information, as opposed to records. Justice Jennifer Brunner, the panel's lone Democrat, asked whether allowing the public official to determine on their own that records aren't public would be a slippery slope.",
      "\u201cDepending on how this decision comes out, if an official decided to engage in illegal or unethical behavior, he would just simply do it on a private email and the public would probably not be able to find out,\u201d she said.",
      "Jeffrey Vardaro, the Center for Media and Democracy's attorney, reminded the court that the outstanding order would merely allow the Tenth District magistrate \u2014 not the center or the public at large \u2014 to review certain documents. He said that undercuts the state's argument that the lawsuit is intended to harass or embarrass Yost, who he reminded has the job of enforcing Ohio's public records law.",
      "Vardara warned the court against making a decision that could allow a public official to unilaterally determine that \"entire categories of what should be public records are not public,\" prevent courts from weighing in, and empower the official to \u201crefuse to testify about what the records were even about.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so it would take the Sunshine Act and turn it into a black box,\" he added."

      "NORFOLK, Va. -- A Virginia man accused of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history and using President Joe Biden's photo for target practice must stay in jail until trial, a federal judge ruled, writing that he has \u201cshown the capacity for extreme danger.\u201d",
      "Brad Spafford, 36, is being held on a federal firearms charge for allegedly owning an unregistered short-barrel rifle. Prosecutors say he faces more potential charges for the explosives, including devices found in a backpack labeled \u201c#nolivesmatter.\u201d",
      "Spafford, a father of two young daughters, also stored a highly unstable explosive material in a garage freezer next to \u201cHot Pockets and frozen corn on the cob,\" according to court documents.",
      "In a ruling late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen in Norfolk noted that Spafford lost three fingers in an accident involving homemade explosives in 2021, something she said his defense attorneys have not disputed.",
      "\u201cMr. Spafford has specifically stated that he does not believe in Government regulation when it comes to firearms, and he intentionally flouted the requirements for registration of short-barrel rifles,\u201d Allen wrote. \u201cThe Court is not confident that Mr. Spafford would be any more respectful of the imposed conditions of release.\u201d",
      "Defense attorneys had argued that authorities haven\u2019t produced evidence that Spafford was planning violence. They also noted that Spafford, who is married and works a steady job as a machinist, has no criminal record.",
      "His attorneys also questioned whether the explosive devices found on Spafford's property were usable because \u201cprofessionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,\u201d his defense lawyers wrote in a recent filing.",
      "Investigators seized more than 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices when they searched Spafford's Isle of Wight County home in December, the prosecutors said in court filings.",
      "Most of the bombs were found in a detached garage, along with tools and bomb-making materials including fuses and pieces of plastic pipe, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cSeveral additional apparent pipe bombs were found in a backpack in the home\u2019s bedroom, completely unsecured,\u201d in the house he shares with his wife and children, prosecutors also wrote.",
      "The investigation began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend and member of law enforcement, told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president for target practice and that \u201che believed political assassinations should be brought back,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on Dec. 17. The agents located the rifle and the explosive devices, some of which had been hand-labeled as \u201clethal\u201d and some of which were loaded into a wearable vest, court documents state. Technicians detonated most of the devices on site because they were deemed unsafe to transport, though several were kept for analysis.",
      "At a hearing last week, federal Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leonard determined that Spafford could be released into house arrest at his mother\u2019s home but agreed to keep him detained while the government files further arguments.",
      "In response, prosecutors acknowledged that Spafford \u201cis not known to have engaged in any apparent violence.\u201d",
      "But they argued that Spafford \"has certainly expressed interest in the same, through his manufacture of pipe bombs marked \u2018lethal,\u2019 his possession of riot gear and a vest loaded with pipe bombs, his support for political assassinations and use of the pictures of the President for target practice, and his belief that \u2018no lives matter.\u2019",
      "In Tuesday's ruling, Allen wrote that the degree of danger that Spafford posed to his own family and community was \u201cextreme\u201d and noted \u201cthe sheer scale of the enterprise.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court has not found a comparable case in terms of scale,\u201d she wrote, \"but even cases involving smaller numbers of destructive devices and other factors that were positive for the defendant have resulted in detention.\""

      "Many of the towering fires began Tuesday and were fueled by powerful Santa Ana winds, which gusted more than 70 mph (112 kph) in some spots. The winds persisted Wednesday and made it too dangerous for aircraft to attack the fires from the sky, furthering hampering their efforts.",

      "A top policymaker at the US Federal Reserve says that he still supports reducing interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top policymaker at the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's board of governors, said he expects inflation will move closer to the Fed's 2% target in the coming months. And in some of the first comments by a Fed official specifically about tariffs, he said that greater import duties likely won't push up inflation this year.",
      "\u201cMy bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said in Paris at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "\u201cIf, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view,\u201d Waller added.",
      "His remarks are noteworthy because the impact of tariffs is a key wild card for the economy this year. Waller also suggested he is more optimistic about inflation than many Wall Street investors, who increasingly expect the Fed to keep its rate steady this year as elevated prices continue to linger.",
      "\u201cI believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% goal over the medium term and that further (rate) reductions will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said. While inflation has been persistent in recent months \u2014 it ticked up to 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 Waller argued that outside of housing, which is difficult to measure, prices are cooling.",
      "Waller\u2019s remarks run counter to increasing expectations on Wall Street that the Fed may not cut its key rate much, if at all, this year. It is currently about 4.3% after several reductions last year from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Financial markets are expecting just one rate reduction in 2025, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "Waller did not say how many cuts he specifically supports. Instead he said that Fed officials projected two reductions this year, as a group, in December. But he also noted that policymakers supported a wide range of outcomes, from no cuts to as many as five. The number of reductions will depend on progress towards reducing inflation, he added."

      "WASHINGTON -- Prosecutors will ask a judge on Wednesday for six years in prison for a former FBI informant whose bogus story about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter accepting bribes became central to Republicans' impeachment effort.",
      "Alexander Smirnov will be sentenced in Los Angeles federal court after pleading guilty last month to tax evasion and lying to the FBI about the phony bribery scheme in what prosecutors say was an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Smirnov, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, falsely claimed to his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each around 2015.",
      "Smirnov's explosive claim in 2020 came after he expressed \"bias\u201d about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors. In reality, investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 \u2014 after Biden's term as vice president.",
      "Prosecutors noted that Smirnov's false claim \u201cset off a firestorm in Congress\u201d when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Biden, a Democrat who defeated Republican then-President Donald Trump in 2020. The Biden administration dismissed the House impeachment effort as a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "Before Smirnov\u2019s arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn\u2019t confirm if they were true.",
      "\"In committing his crimes he betrayed the United States, a country that showed him nothing but generosity, including conferring on him the greatest honor it can bestow, citizenship,\" Justice Department special counsel David Weiss' team wrote in court papers. \"He repaid the trust the United States placed in him to be a law-abiding naturalized citizen and, more specifically, that one of its premier law enforcement agencies placed in him to tell the truth as a confidential human source, by attempting to interfere in a Presidential election.\"",
      "Smirnov was arrested last February in the case accusing him of lying to the FBI, and prosecutors in November brought new tax charges alleging he concealed millions of dollars of income he earned between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Smirnov's lawyers are seeking no more than four years behind bars, noting the \u201csubstantial assistance\" he provided to the U.S. government as an FBI informant for more than a decade. Smirnov's lawyers noted in court papers that he suffers from serious health issues related to his eyes and argue that a lengthy sentence would \u201cunnecessarily prolong his suffering.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Smirnov has learned a very grave lesson and proffers to this Honorable Court that he will not find himself on this side of the law again,\u201d attorneys Richard Schonfeld and David Chesnoff told the judge in court papers.",
      "Smirnov was prosecuted by Weiss, who also brought gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced in December after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to tax charges. But he was pardoned by his father, who said he believed \u201craw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d",
      "In seeking a lighter sentence, Smirnov's lawyers wrote in court papers that both Hunter Biden and President-elect Trump \u2014 who was charged in two federal cases by a different special counsel \u2014 \u201chave walked free and clear of any meaningful punishment.\u201d",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith abandoned the two federal cases against Trump \u2014 accusing him of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida \u2014 after Trump's presidential victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",

      "Wildlife officials have rescued a bull elk by lowering it down a cliff after the animal became entangled in a rope at a popular ice climbing area in southwestern Colorado",
      "LAKE CITY, Colo. -- Wildlife officials and several climbers rescued a bull elk by lowering it down a cliff after the animal became entangled in a rope at a popular ice climbing area in southwestern Colorado.",
      "Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said a group of ice climbers in Lake City encountered the distressed elk Friday morning, and a CPW biologist darted the ungulate with a tranquilizer and covered part of its head with a ski mask to protect its eyes during the rescue.",
      "The team cut the rope away from the elk's antlers but needed a way to get the 700-pound (318-kilogram) animal down from the climbing wall.",
      "That's when the ice climbers who reported the stranded elk came to the rescue by helping state wildlife officers rig a system that used two ropes \u2014 one under its chest and another along its antlers \u2014 to lower it to the base of the route. Once the elk was on more level ground, the CPW team reversed the effects of the tranquilizer, and about 12 minutes later the elk awoke and ran off down the snowy canyon.",
      "\u201cWhen we reverse that tranquilizer drug, it can take several minutes for the animal to regain full use of its body. Sometimes they will stand quickly but still be woozy on their feet, or sometimes it will take them a few attempts to get fully standing,\u201d said John Livingston, a spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife.",
      "He said the 2 1/2-year-old elk became stuck the previous night and was discovered at dawn, fatigued and with a few minor scrapes from trying to break free. It took more than two hours to free the hapless animal.",
      "Elk sometimes get their unwieldy antlers entangled in man-made hazards such as clothes lines, fencing and hammocks."

      "The family of a Air Force contractor who was killed when she walked into a rotating drone propeller has filed a lawsuit against her company, Sumaria Systems LLC, claiming her trainer subjected her to gender and racial discrimination that ultimately put...",
      "NEW YORK -- On the night Stephanie Cosme died, her sister and brother said they received a curt explanation from a U.S. Air Force official who met them at the hospital: The civilian contractor was failing to follow protocol when she was hit by an aircraft's rotating propeller and killed.",
      "The family would wait eight agonizing months to find out more about how the accident unfolded during relatively low-risk ground testing on a MQ-9A Reaper drone at Gray Butte Airfield in California on Sept. 7, 2023. They felt sure there was more to the story than Cosme, a 32-year-old testing engineer who worked for Air Force contractor Sumaria Systems, LLC, simply not following instructions.",
      "A report from the U.S. Air Force Aircraft Accident Investigation Board eventually confirmed their instincts, finding that her trainer rushed the job and improperly instructed Cosme on how to take data readings from the drone, among other contributing factors.",
      "But in a lawsuit filed last month against Sumaria, the family says they see a darker explanation.",
      "Citing witness testimony from the Air Force investigation, the family contends that Cosme's death was the culmination of a gender and racial discrimination campaign by the testing director, Derek Kirkendall, who they claim had a history of hostility against Hispanic employees at the company.",
      "Saul Ewing, the law firm representing both the company and Kirkendall, said in a statement \u201cthe defendants deny any wrongdoing or liability whatsoever,\u201d and that they will \"address the allegations of the lawsuit in court through the legal process.\u201d",
      "The Air Force report, released in April, does not cite racial or gender discrimination as a contributing factor to Cosme's death. But the family's lawyers, Justin Green and Debra Katz, say they are basing their allegations on witness testimony from the Air Force investigation showing that Kirkendall deliberately isolated Cosme on the day of her death, assigned her to dangerous tasks that kept her away from the rest of the team and failed to inform the ground crew of her role. The lawsuit also says Kirkendall, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, disparaged her using anti-Hispanic tropes, describing her as \u201clazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery night I would go to bed and I would look at her picture and I was like, \u2018What happened? Did you get distracted? Did you trip?\u2019\u201d said her sister, Cassaundra Cosme. \u201cThe not knowing was terrible.\u201d",
      "But knowing wasn\u2019t much comfort either: \u201cIt was a relief that it wasn\u2019t her fault but then it was terrible that it wasn\u2019t a just a horrible accident,\u201d Cosme said.",
      "The lawsuit also cites a hostile workplace complaint filed against Kirkendall by Cosme's predecessor, who is not named in the filing but is also Latina and quit after raising her concerns. Katz and Green say Kirkendall was subjecting Cosme, who was of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, to similar abuse, ultimately creating the unsafe conditions that led to her death.",
      "In written testimony submitted to the Air Force investigator, one testing engineer said Kirkendall told him he was \u201chazing\u201d Cosme by having her stand for hours in the sun by the aircraft for a seemingly unimportant task without any way to communicate with her colleagues back in the control station. The Air Force report said that none of the ground crew knew what Cosme\u2019s role was during the testing or that Kirkendall planned to have her approach the aircraft while its propeller was still running.",
      "Kirkendall's treatment of Cosme is typical of the \u201cway gender harassment works when women try to break into male-dominated fields. They make it much more difficult and they often make them feel unsafe,\u201d said Katz, a prominent civil rights attorney who concentrates on sexual harassment and discrimination.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows he\u2019s hazing her, and this is so endemic to the culture that no one tells him to stop,\" Katz added. \u201cWe felt this suit was really important to name it for what it is. This is gender discrimination that led to somebody\u2019s death.\u201d",
      "In his testimony to the Air Force investigator, Kirkendall acknowledged that Cosme's predecessor had filed a hostile environment complaint, saying it came as a shock to him because he thought he had \"an excellent rapport\" with the woman. Kirkendall said Sumaria completed its investigation into her complaint and \u201cconcluded that it was unfounded,\" but that the woman had already quit.",
      "The lawsuit also claims that two male Hispanic employees quit Sumaria because of Kirkendall\u2019s mistreatment of them.",
      "The AP could not independently confirm the details of the previous complaint against Kirkendall, or that the two Hispanic engineers also quit. Sumaria representatives did not answer detailed questions about the allegations against Kirkendall or the outcome of the previous complaint.",
      "It is not clear what, if any actions, Sumaria has taken in response to the accident or to the findings of the Air Force investigation.",
      "While the Air Force Aircraft Accident Investigation Board\u2019s report findings are public, any \u201csafety recommendations for preventing a reoccurrence\u201d are made to the parties by a separate investigative board and kept privileged, said Anthony Roake, a spokesperson for Air Force Materiel Command, the command responsible for developing and testing Air Force weapon systems.",
      "Sumaria has defended Kirkendall's conduct on the day of the test in a detailed response to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, which conducted its own investigation into Cosme's death and imposed penalties in March totaling $38,055 for several safety violations, including the company's failure to effectively instruct employees to maintain a safe distance from the aircraft and rotating propeller. Like the Air Force report, the investigation did not cite racial or gender discrimination as a factor.",
      "Sumaria, which is appealing the penalties, disputed that Kirkendall improperly instructed Cosme and said she \"violated all of her training and direct instructions\u201d on how to approach the aircraft.",
      "Jennifer Mondino, director of the TIME UP's Legal Defense Fund at the National Women's Law Center, which helps bring sexual and gender harassment cases but is not involved in Cosme's lawsuit, said gender harassment cases involving a victim who is deceased are not unprecedented but can be complicated. She said proving gender discrimination can be a challenge under any circumstances because it involves persuading people to speak out in a workplace culture that discourages it.",
      "\u201cIf the person who was affected is no longer with us, it's sort of an obvious point, but it's a significant obstacle,\u201d Mondino said.",
      "From the Cosme family's perspective, nobody has been held accountable for the failings that led to her death just a few months before she was getting married. The lawsuit demands a jury trial and unspecified damages.",
      "Cosme's family said her calm and enthusiastic demeanor was typical of her approach toward forging a career in a male-dominated field, starting with engineer classes in high school where she was only one of three girls in the first year and the only one left by the third year. She followed her father, Mario, into engineering and earned a Master of Science in Engineering/Industrial Management from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The family buried Cosme in her wedding dress, which they had altered so it could cover her wounds.",
      "\u201cWe will never get over this. We had a perfect life going on. Life was wonderful,\u201d Mario Cosme said. \u201cAnd Sumaria and Derek Kirkendall ruined a lifetime of effort of doing things the right way.\u201d"

      "The resulting thin staffing at Utah's Park City Mountain Resort, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City in the Wasatch Range, has left many runs closed and caused long lines for ski lifts.",

      "As talks stalled, 200 patrollers went on strike on Dec. 27, alleging unfair bargaining by the company.",
      "Here's the latest on the strike:",
      "They maintain safety at ski resorts by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, sometimes by releasing avalanches with explosives when nobody's in range.",
      "It's a seasonal job. After the snow melts away, so do they.",
      "Many in the Rocky Mountain region work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in the warmer months. Often they're young people starting in the workforce.",

      "The specialized work requires training and dedication \u2014 and ought to be compensated without too much stress over living costs in pricey mountain towns such as Park City, the ski patroller union argues.",
      "The strike comes as actions by labor unions soared over the past couple of years. Unions secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers' ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association has been negotiating since March, seeking an increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union says $27 is considered a livable wage in pricey Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "They also seek higher pay for the longest-serving ski patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "\u201cWe just want to make sure these tenured patrollers are compensated for their skills and encouraged to stick around,\u201d Park City ski patroller and association spokesperson Alana McClements said.",
      "The ski patrollers got a big raise a couple years ago.",
      "Vail Resorts argues it was generous with its 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It's now offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "\"We deeply regret that this is having any level of impact on the guest experience and are grateful to our thousands of employees who are working hard every day to enable the experience at Park City Mountain and open the terrain,\u201d Bill Rock, president of Vail Resorts mountain division, said in a statement.",
      "Snow has been falling thick and fast in Park City, with more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) in the past week. But much of Park City Mountain Resort is closed because of the strike.",
      "As of Monday, only 25 of 41 lifts and 103 of 350 trails were open, according to the resort's website.",
      "Vail Resorts apparently has brought in nonunion workers from other resorts to help keep the one in Park City running, McClements said.",
      "Union ski patrollers at other U.S. Vail Resorts properties, including Breckenridge, Crested Butte and Keystone in Colorado, have expressed solidarity with the Park City Mountain Resort workers and complained about pressure put on workers from elsewhere to go there.",
      "Sympathizers include other workers at the resort, including ski instructors and snow groomers, who hope their own wages will increase if the patrollers are successful, ski instructor Grace Mauzy said.",
      "\u201cSki patrol requires even more skilled learning than to be instructor, but to be instructor you also have to have skills training,\u201d Mauzy said. \"They\u2019re both highly underpaid.\u201d",
      "There's a wider sense, McClements said, that if Vail Resorts gives in to the union's demands, ski workers elsewhere will demand increases.",
      "\u201cThere is a history of mountain workers being paid unlivable wages because people view parts of the job as fun,\" McClements said. \"We definitely see this as a broader fight.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe could be prickly and a not very appealing personality\u201d in a town that thrives on relationships, Alter said, describing a president who struggled with schmoozing lawmakers and reporters.",
      "The gatekeepers of Washington society never embraced Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, either, not quite knowing what to make of the small-town Southerners who carried their own luggage and bought their clothes off the rack. Carter sold what had been the presidential yacht, a perk his predecessors had used to wine and dine Capitol power players.",
      "Early in Carter\u2019s presidency, Washington Post society columnist Sally Quinn tagged the Carters and their West Wing as \u201can alien tribe,\u201d incapable of \u201cplaying \u2018the game.\u2019\u201d An elite Georgetown hostess herself, Quinn nodded to Washington\u2019s \u201cfrivolity\u201d but nonetheless mocked \u201cthe Carter people\u201d as \u201cnot, in fact, comfortable in limousines, yachts, or in elegant salons, in black tie\u201d or with \u201cplace cards, servants, six courses, different forks, three wines ... and after-dinner mingling.\u201d",
      "He endured a rocky four years that left him without enough friends in the town\u2019s power circles and, ultimately, across an electorate that delivered nearly 500 Electoral College votes to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election.",
      "Long after leaving office, Carter still bemoaned a political cartoon published around his inauguration that depicted his family approaching the White House with his mother, \u201cMiss Lillian,\u201d chewing on a hayseed.",
      "Carter often flouted the ceremonial trappings that have been on display in Georgia and will continue in Washington.",
      "As president, he wanted to keep the Marine Band from playing \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d thinking it elevated the president too much. His advisers convinced him to accept it as part of the job. And the song played Saturday as he arrived at his presidential center after a motorcade through his hometown of Plains and past his boyhood farm.",
      "He also never used his full name, James Earl Carter Jr., even taking the oath of office. His full name was printed on memorial cards given to all mourners who paid their respects in Atlanta.",
      "He once addressed the nation from the White House residence wearing a cardigan, now on display at his museum and library. His remains now rest in a wooden casket being carried and guarded by military pallbearers in their impeccable dress uniforms.",
      "\u201cHe was a simple man in so many ways,\u201d said Brad Webb, an Army veteran who came to honor the former president at his library, which is on the same campus as The Carter Center, where the former president and first lady based their decades of advocacy for democracy, public health and human rights in the developing world.",
      "\u201cHe was also a complicated man, who took his defeat and did so much good in the world,\" said Webb, who voted for Republican Gerald Ford in 1976 and Reagan in 1980. \u201cAnd, looking back, some of the things in his presidency \u2014 the inflation, the Iran hostages, the energy crisis \u2014 were really things that no president can actually control. We get to look back with some perspective and understand that he was an excellent former president but also had a presidency we can appreciate more than we did as it was happening.\u201d"

      "The White House says President Joe Biden will establish two new national monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes",
      "LOS ANGELES -- President Joe Biden is establishing two new national monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes, the White House confirmed Tuesday, as Biden seeks to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through his \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative.",
      "Proclamations set to be signed Tuesday will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument in Northern California. The declarations bar drilling and mining and other development on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site and roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) near the Oregon border in Northern California.",
      "The new monuments will protect clean water for communities, honor areas of cultural significance to tribal nations and Indigenous peoples, and enhance access to nature, the White House said.",
      "Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is set to visit Los Angeles and the Eastern Coachella Valley on Tuesday after meeting Monday with the families of the victims in the New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans.",
      "Biden announced Monday he will ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California and other West Coast states. The plan is intended to block possible efforts by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.",
      "The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president\u2019s \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.",
      "The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument. The area is a spiritual center for the Pit River and Modoc Tribes and encompasses mountain woodlands and meadows that are home to rare flowers and wildlife.",
      "A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, in early 2023. The monument would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.",
      "Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites.",
      "\u201cThe designation of the Chuckwalla and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monuments in California marks an historic step toward protecting lands of profound cultural, ecological and historical significance for all Americans,\" said Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.",
      "The new monuments \u201chonor the enduring stewardship of Tribal Nations and the tireless efforts of local communities and conservation advocates who fought to safeguard these irreplaceable landscapes for future generations,'' Hauser said.",
      "National monuments like Chuckwalla and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla play a key role in addressing historical injustices and ensuring a more inclusive telling of America\u2019s history, she said.",
      "The Chuckwalla monument is intended to honor tribal sovereignty by including local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.",
      "\u201cThe protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,\u201d the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. \u201cTribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.\u201d",
      "In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California \u2014 the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved.",
      "Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to manage tribal land with the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League, which is conveying the land to the tribe.",

      "A police transcript says the man accused of setting a woman on fire inside a New York City subway told detectives that he had no recollection of the fatal attack",

      "The interview was made public shortly after Sebastian Zapeta, 33, entered a plea of not guilty on murder and arson charges in a Brooklyn court. Prosecutors say he set fire to Debrina Kawam, 57, aboard a stopped train in the early morning hours of Dec. 22, fanned the flames with a shirt and watched the woman burn from a subway bench.",
      "Inside a Brooklyn precinct later that day, authorities described Zapeta as reacting with \u201cdisgust\u201d and \u201cstrangeness\u201d to the video, wiping his eyes and exclaiming in Spanish, \u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d according to the transcript.",
      "\u201cI am very sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d he then told detectives. \"I don\u2019t know what happened, but I\u2019m very sorry for that woman.\u201d",
      "He added that he had been drinking heavily throughout the night and fallen asleep on the subway, but did not remember what happened next.",
      "Zapeta, a Guatemalan citizen who authorities say entered the country illegally after being deported in 2018, had been living in a Brooklyn shelter and working as a roofer. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole on the murder charge.",
      "During a brief arraignment Tuesday, Zapeta kept his gaze on the floor as his attorney entered a plea of not guilty, nodding his head slightly while a Spanish translator whispered in his ear.",
      "He was previously arraigned last month on a criminal complaint, but in New York, all felony cases require a grand jury indictment to proceed to trial unless a defendant waives that requirement.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office will seek the maximum punishment of life in prison with no chance of parole. He said after Zapeta was indicted in December that prosecutors are pursuing the charges \u201cunder the theory that this was an intentional act\u201d but noted the indictment includes a \u201cdepraved indifference\u201d murder charge.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to fathom what could lead someone to commit the atrocious and horrific murder with which this defendant is charged,\u201d Gonzalez said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMs. Kawam and her loved ones deserve a measure of justice and New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in the subways.\u201d",
      "Zapeta\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment Monday evening.",
      "Kawam grew up in Little Falls, New Jersey, and attended Passaic Valley Regional High School, where she was a popular student, cheerleader and pancake house worker, her childhood and young adult friends told The New York Times.",
      "In her 20s, she traveled to Jamaica, Mexico, the Bahamas and Las Vegas with friends and worked a variety of jobs that she never held too long, a friend, Cindy Certosimo Bowie told the Times. The Associated Press has left messages for possible relatives.",
      "In the early 2000s, she worked at the pharmaceutical giant Merck, but her life took a rocky turn at some point. She went into debt, had liens filed against her and filed for bankruptcy, according to public records. A Debrina Kawam listed in court records also was arrested several times in minor crimes.",

      "It's been decades since thousands of human bones and bone fragments were unearthed on a suspected Indiana serial killer\u2019s property",
      "WESTFIELD, Ind. -- Decades after investigators unearthed thousands of human bones and bone fragments on a suspected Indiana serial killer\u2019s property, a renewed quest is playing out in laboratories to solve a long-running mystery: Who were they?",
      "A new team working to identify the unknown dead says the key to their success will be getting relatives of men who vanished between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s to provide samples of their own DNA.",
      "Those samples can then be screened against DNA profiles scientists are extracting from the remains, which were found starting in 1996 on Herbert Baumeister\u2019s sprawling suburban Indianapolis property.",
      "The original investigators believed that at least 25 people were buried at Baumeister\u2019s 18-acre (7.3-hectare) Fox Hollow Farm estate in Westfield, based on evidence that included 10,000 bones and bone fragments, as well as handcuffs and shotgun shells.",
      "Baumeister, a 49-year-old thrift store owner and married father of three, killed himself in Canada in July 1996 before police could question him, taking with him many secrets, including the names of his presumed victims.",
      "Investigators believed that while his family was away on trips, Baumeister, who frequented gay bars in Indianapolis, lured men to his home, where he killed and buried them.",
      "By the late 1990s, authorities had identified eight men using dental records and available DNA technologies. But then those efforts stopped, although the remains of at least 17 people may have still been unidentified.",
      "Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said the renewed identification effort revealed that county officials at the time decided not to fund additional DNA testing, which \u201cessentially halted further efforts to identify the victims and placed the cost of a homicide investigation on family members of missing people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t speak for those investigators, but it was just game over,\u201d Jellison said.",
      "As decades slipped by, the bones and fragments sat in boxes at the University of Indianapolis' Human Identification Center, whose staff helped excavate the remains.",
      "That changed after Eric Pranger sent Jellison a Facebook message in late 2022. The Indianapolis man's family had long believed his older cousin, Allen Livingston, was among Baumeister\u2019s victims.",
      "Livingston was 27 when he vanished in August 1993 after getting into someone else\u2019s car in downtown Indianapolis. After hearing about Baumeister three years later, his mother, Sharon Livingston, and other relatives began suspecting that Allen, who was bisexual, was among the dead.",
      "Jellison was about to take office when Pranger asked if he could help get some answers for his aunt, who had serious health problems.",
      "\u201cHow do you say to no to that? That\u2019s our job as coroners by statute, to identify the deceased,\u201d Jellison said.",
      "In late 2022, police took DNA samples from Sharon Livingston and one of her daughters. Jellison began working with a team that includes the Indiana State Police, the FBI, the Human Identification Center, local law enforcement and a private company that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy.",
      "Staff at the Human Identification Center, where the remains are stored in a temperature- and humidity-controlled space, selected some of the most promising bones for DNA analysis.",
      "At the Indiana State Police Laboratory, scientists cut out sections of bone, froze them with liquid nitrogen and pulverized them into a fine powder. They then used heat and chemicals to break open bone cells in the first step toward extracting a full DNA profile.",
      "Nearly a year after hearing from Pranger, Jellison announced in October 2023 that a ninth Baumeister victim had been identified: Allen Livingston.",
      "Sharon Livingston finally received some form of closure. She died in November 2024.",
      "\u201cIt made me happy to be able to do this for my aunt,\" Pranger, 34, said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who got the ball rolling to bring her son home after 30 years and I felt privileged.\"",
      "\u201cAfter Allen was identified I was so excited and then after the fact I asked myself, `Now what? I got answers, but what about all the other families?\u2019\u201d Pranger added.",
      "Jellison said about 40 DNA samples have been submitted by people who believe a missing male relative may have been killed by Baumeister. He said those are entered into the FBI\u2019s Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, but are used solely for identifying missing people.",
      "The coroner and his partners hope to get more DNA samples from relatives of men from across the U.S. who vanished between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. They noted the men may have been traveling and stopped in Indianapolis to visit friends or sample its nightlife.",
      "To date, scientists have extracted eight unique DNA profiles \u2014 all male \u2014 from more than 70 of the 100 bones that were sent to the Indiana State Police Laboratory by Dr. Krista Latham, the Human Identification Center's director.",
      "One matched DNA samples provided by Livingston\u2019s mother and sister. Four matched four of the eight men first identified in the 1990s: Jeffrey Jones, Manuel Resendez, Johnny Bayer and Richard Hamilton.",
      "The three other DNA profiles remain unidentified and two are still undergoing testing. Those three have boosted Baumeister\u2019s presumed victims to 12.",
      "Jellison and his partners say their identification effort could take several more years to complete.",
      "Most of the bones were crushed and burned, reducing their potential to yield usable DNA. Latham, a professor of biology and anthropology, said bone fragments deemed in poor shape are being held back from the destructive testing process in hope that future DNA technologies can unlock their secrets.",
      "She noted some of the men may have been estranged from relatives or ostracized because of their sexuality. No one may have noticed when they vanished.",
      "\u201cThese are individuals who were marginalized in life. And we just need to make sure that that\u2019s not continuing in death as well,\u201d Latham said.",
      "For the ongoing work, Jellison has obtained DNA reference samples from relatives of seven of the eight men originally identified in the 1990s. The eighth man, Steven Hale, was adopted and efforts to locate biological relatives have thus far failed, the coroner said.",
      "Relatives of missing men who want to provide family DNA reference samples for the effort to identify remains can contact the Indiana State Police missing persons hotline at 833-466-2653 or the Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s Office at 317-770-4415.",
      "As remains are identified, piece by piece, families can opt to have them cremated and interred at a memorial dedicated in August in Westfield. It includes a plaque with the names of the nine identified victims, with room for more names.",
      "Linda Znachko, whose nonprofit Indianapolis-based ministry He Knows Your Name, paid for the monument, said at the memorial's dedication that the identification campaign \"will bring honor to those who lost their lives at the Fox Hollow tragedy.\u201d Remains belonging to Livingston and Jeffrey Jones were added to the memorial's ossuary and white doves were released during the dedication.",
      "Livingston\u2019s younger sister, Shannon Doughty, attended with several relatives, including Pranger. She said it was a relief finally knowing what happened to her brother, despite his tragic end.",
      "\u201cAt least you know,\u201d said Doughty, 46. \u201cThe fear of the unknown is the worst right? So just knowing, it\u2019s a multitude of emotions. You wanted to know but you didn\u2019t want to know. But you needed to know.\u201d"

      "\"Having stability in the public finances is precursor to having economic stability and economic growth,\" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride claimed that the Chancellor's significant spending and borrowing plans from the Budget are \"making it more expensive for the government to borrow\".",
      "\"We should be building a more resilient economy, not raising taxes to pay for fiscal incompetence,\" he said in a post on X.",
      "The warning comes after the cost of borrowing over 30 years hit its highest level for 27 years on Tuesday.",

      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",

      "Globally, there has been a rise in the cost of government borrowing in recent months sparked by investor concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump's plans to impose new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China would push up inflation.",
      "The prospect of those policies is colliding with separate concerns about growing US debt and persistent inflation, which could also keep borrowing costs high. In the US, interest rates on 10-year government bonds also surged on Wednesday, before dropping back at mid-day to more than 4.7%, still the highest level since April.",
      "Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said the UK rises were similar to those in the US.",
      "\"US Treasury 10-year yields have jumped to the highest level since April, whilst in the UK 10-year borrowing costs have soared to their highest levels since the financial crisis,\" she said.",

      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",

      "He added that while it was inappropriate for his government to comment on individual companies: \"We must insist on an explanation as to why there are security concerns, otherwise there will be no progress in future discussions.\"",
      "Since 1990, the US has blocked just eight foreign takeover deals - most in the last decade and involving firms from China.",
      "The lawsuit could leave the fate of the deal in the hands of the next administration, where some experts have said it could get a more favourable second hearing.",
      "But President-elect Donald Trump has also said he would block the deal. On Monday, he wrote on Truth Social: \"Why would they want to sell US Steel now when tariffs will make it a much more profitable and valuable company?\"",
      "Trump has said he plans to enact sweeping tariffs, which make imports into the US more expensive.",
      "He has said the measures, which he also deployed during his first term, will make it easier for US-based companies to compete with overseas rivals and spur a manufacturing boom, increasing demand for steel.",
      "According to economic analyses, the tariffs on foreign steel that he unveiled in 2018 led to modest job gains at steel-makers but job losses at other manufacturing companies that were forced to contend with higher steel costs."

      "Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk.",

      "Layer up with clothes, safely use a hot water bottle, and make sure you have warm nightwear.",
      "When it comes to heating, there is much debate about whether it is more efficient to keep it permanently on low, rather than switch it on and off when needed.",

      "It is more important than ever to eat and drink properly, even with little motivation while stuck at home.",
      "Age UK says warming foods, like soup and stews, and hot drinks like tea can help keep you warm. People should try to have at least one hot meal a day and as many hot drinks as possible. Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money.",
      "Take care not to overfill the kettle by measuring out what is needed to keep costs down. Batch cooking can also help. Don't forget fruit and vegetables - the latter can be cooked with a steamer on one hob, rather than using different ones.",
      "When washing up, if your hot water is too hot to wash your hands in, then your setting is probably too high so turn the boiler down. Wash clothes at 30C, not 40C.",
      "Keep moving as much as you can between meals. That is likely to help your mental, as well as physical, health.",

      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

      "\"And that's exactly what I was trying to do - incorporate the more traditional form of songwriting and melody of 60s music with electronic production.",
      "\"That makes it sound a lot better than it was, by the way. But that's what I was trying to do, at least for a bit.\"",
      "Mainnie decided to dedicate himself to dance music after discovering the nightclubs around Edinburgh's Cowgate as a student, while studying music at Edinburgh Napier University.",

      "\"So I feel like I have a passion for both equally and mutually, and I think that's why it's been so easy to transition from DJ-ing into - not just a band, but the music that I make lends itself well to live performance of electronic music. It still holds the basic principles of traditional songwriting, but with electronic production.\"",

      "Mainnie says \"more leftfield\" electronic music like his \"definitely feels like it's got a bigger audience than it's ever had\".",
      "\"I don't really know what's happened in the past few years, but the music I was listening to, and some of the artists that I was listening to a few years ago when I was going clubbing that were quite niche - now they're almost pop stars.",

    "summary": "Stars such as The Rock and John Cena make a return as the flagship Raw show launches on Netflix.",
    "story": [
      "WWE's flagship Raw show has aired on Netflix for the first time with the return of multiple big names.",
      "The much-anticipated programme saw superstars including The Rock, John Cena and The Undertaker make appearances during the three-hour event in Los Angeles.",
      "Pro-wrestling's most popular weekly show had previously been shown on broadcast TV around the world for 31 years.",
      "But last year bosses of TKO - the company formed when WWE merged with UFC - announced that Raw would be exclusive to streaming.",
      "It's claimed that it brings in 17.5m viewers each week in the US, and that WWE boasts one billion followers across various social media platforms.",
      "Reviews of the first show suggested it \"was far from perfect\" but that there were \"lots of special moments to cover\".",
      "Another noted the \"amazing production values and improved visuals\" but criticised \"the sameness of the promos\" delivered by stars such as Triple H, The Rock and John Cena.",
      "There was praise for the in-ring action, but widespread agreement that bringing out WWE to use Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan was \"a mis-step\" after loud boos from the California crowd during his appearance.",
      "The show also marked the start of John Cena's \"farewell tour\", with the star announcing 2025 will be his last year as a competitor.",
      "Cena is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time and has achieved world champion status a joint record 16 times since joining WWE in 2001.",
      "He told cheering fans he \"could not think of a better place to start\" his goodbye, while stating his intention to \"win the Royal Rumble\" event in February.",
      "Fans were also treated to the return of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who is a director of TKO.",
      "The Rock has previously played the villainous role of \"The Final Boss\", but on this occasion he spoke about the \"history\" of the night and, to the surprise of many, praised and embraced former rival Cody Rhodes.",
      "He then later appeared at the conclusion of the Tribal Combat Match between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa, embracing Reigns following his victory.",
      "The night also saw the brief return of The Undertaker at the end of the Women's World Championship match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley.",
      "It was the culmination of a long-term storyline which saw Ripley win the championship.",
      "The action ended with CM Punk and Seth Rollins following up a much-praised back-and-forth promo on the final televised episode of Raw.",
      "It was a match widely recognised as the highlight of the night's in-ring action, with the sometimes divisive Punk coming out on top.",
      "What the Netflix deal could mean for WWE",
      "Netflix agreed to pay more than $5bn (\u00a34bn) for rights to show Raw and other WWE programming, including archive content.",
      "Viewers outside the US will be able to watch all weekly shows such as SmackDown, NXT and live events on the service.",
      "The company said that would include pay-per-view specials including WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "It said the deal would affect fans in the USA, Canada, UK and Latin America first, before being expanded to other countries later.",
      "\"So many people use Netflix and they'll put it on and see WWE prominently,\" says Brandon Thurston, editor of wrestling site Wrestlenomics.",
      "\"So that [could] have a great positive effect for their business.\"",
      "With streaming on the rise and television numbers shrinking, Brandon feels WWE has the opportunity to enter more households around the world and attract newer, younger audiences.",
      "\"We're going away from traditional TV [to] the most popular streaming platform. So it should increase that 18-49 audience even more.\"",
      "Raw had a three-hour runtime for 12 years, before cutting down to two at the end of 2024.",
      "WWE's chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque says the streaming platform gives them \"flexibility\" when it comes to timings.",
      "And Brandon feels it can have an impact on the style of content too, being able to have more or less from week to week.",
      "\"They have the freedom to not be bound to a time slot\", unlike normal TV timings, he says.",
      "While Brandon thinks there are overwhelming positives to the deal, he notes the reliance on the streamer could potentially be a negative.",
      "\"That's definitely a possibility that Netflix could start to lose subscribers for one reason or another.",
      "\"[But] I think it's important emphasise just how far ahead it is of everybody else in the streaming market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rising pop star Myles Smith can still remember the first time he felt famous.",
      "\"This might sound trivial,\" says the singer, \"but I was playing a concert where I asked the audience, 'Does anyone have cookies?'",
      "\"And within about 10 minutes, the whole dressing room was full of cookies.",
      "\"It was the best thing ever.\"",
      "Since that gig, the 26-year-old's career has only grown bigger.",
      "Last year, he scored his first major hit with Stargazing, a feel-good foot-stomper that became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, and even featured on Barack Obama's end of year playlist.",
      "Now, he's been voted into fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025, marking him out as one of the year's most promising new talents.",
      "And in March, he'll receive the Brit Awards' Rising Star prize \u2013 following in the footsteps of Sam Fender, Adele and Rag 'N' Bone Man.",

      "\"The night before, I'd tried to go drink-for-drink with some people who were a lot more experienced than me, and we actually had to call a doctor to my Airbnb,\" he cringes.",
      "\"Finding out I'd got a Brit Award brought me back to life more than any vitamin C ever could.\"",
      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",
      "\"I remember writing this song called Dream Girl, when I was 11,\" he says.",
      "\"It was about a girl at school, and it was bloody awful - but I sang it at school assembly anyway.",
      "\"Terrible decision. She realised it was about her and avoided me every day after that.\"",
      "Undeterred, he started playing at open mic nights around the town \u2013 covering artists like Ed Sheeran and Marcus Mumford while fine-tuning his distinctive folk-pop style.",
      "For a long time, however, music was a side hustle. After completing a sociology degree in 2019, Smith set up his own business, specialising in management and strategic development, and was turning a healthy profit by the time he was 23.",
      "\"I was quite comfortable,\" he says. \"But I understood quite early on that just because I'm good at something, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm passionate about it.\"",
      "He ploughed his earnings into studio sessions, recording an eight-track album called Scars in 2020. But it wasn't until his haunting cover of The Neighbourhood's Sweater Weather went viral in 2022 that he felt confident enough to pack in his day job.",
      "\"Money has never been the way I measure my success, but it was definitely scary,\" he says.",
      "\"It started off very much like plunging into an ice bath and feeling the shock. Like, 'OK, this is real. I don't have a consistent salary coming in, and I don't have the security of knowing how long this is going to take.'",
      "\"But it was a matter of switching mentality - so I wasn't looking at what securities I had lost, but what opportunities I'd gained.\"",

      "With a growing online fanbase, Smith started interspersing TikTok cover versions with snippets of originals.",
      "The one that made everyone pay attention was Solo \u2013 whose devious wordplay was so obviously memorable (\"Why'd you get me so high/ To leave me solo\") you couldn't quite believe no-one had thought of it before.",
      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",
      "\"There's a difference between the chase for virality and building an audience,\" he reasons.",
      "\"If your objective is to go viral, then you're always going to be fighting a losing battle. But if your objective is to establish a community and a place where your music belongs, it becomes a lot more rewarding.\"",
      "When he's not sharing music, there's a thoughtful tone to his social posts. In one recent note, he addressed people who said his music had \"saved their lives\".",
      "\"I need you to know, it wasn't my music, it was you,\" he wrote. \"I know this because I've been where you are. I've clung to songs in the dark searching for something \u2013 anything \u2013 that made me feel like I could keep going.",
      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",
      "What's more, he's guaranteed to get free cookies.",

      "\"I never thought I would win\", she said, because there were \"so many great performances in English, so this tells so much about the difference in cinema nowadays.\"",
      "She was asked about the celebrations happening back in her home country of Brazil, with one reporter remarking that it was like she'd won the country the World Cup.",
      "\"It is something very patriotic that's happening in Brazil with this film,\" she said, noting the country was \"very happy\" thanks to the Golden Globes.",

      "She said the award reflected the message of the film, a body horror about a woman who trades her body for a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "\"I'll just leave you with one thing that I think this movie is imparting is in those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough, or basically just not enough,\" Moore said.",

      "Jodie Foster, who is the same age as Moore, won the award for best actress in a limited series and said the 60s are a \"golden age\" because there's like \"a hormone that happens when suddenly you go, 'Oh, I don't really care about all the stupid things anymore\".",

    "story": [
      "One of the UK's most promising new guitar bands, English Teacher, have kicked off the countdown of the top five on the BBC's annual list of music's rising stars.",
      "The Leeds quartet have been voted in fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 poll \u2013 with a panel of 180 music industry experts choosing them as one of the acts with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months.",
      "They got well on their way last year. In September, the band beat pop stars like Charli XCX and CMAT to win the Mercury Prize for their debut album, This Could Be Texas.",
      "The record deals in sharp portraits of life in sleepy northern towns, where the background hum of racism, loneliness and deprivation is thrown into sharp relief by sublime scenery and lifelong friendships.",
      "Their music, meanwhile, is constantly surprising \u2013 full of shifting time signatures, needle-point guitar riffs and soaring melodies that are simultaneously odd and captivating.",
      "\"We never really set out with an aim to create something specific,\" says guitarist Lewis Whiting. \"But, that's the fun part, right? Trying to make something new and interesting.\"",
      "Chappell Roan and Ezra Collective on BBC Sound of 2025 list",
      "Find out all about BBC Sound of 2025",
      "Indie band English Teacher win Mercury Prize",
      "They say the acclaim they've received so far still doesn't feel real. \"Where we come from, this just doesn't happen,\" says frontwoman Lily Fontaine.",
      "\"I keep telling people that I feel like I'm living in a simulation.\"",
      "\"It does feel dream-like,\" adds Whiting.",
      "\"Best year of my life, craziest year of my life.\"",
      "Over the last 12 months, the group have played more than 100 gigs in 16 countries, rising steadily up festival bills as they go, and surviving on \"willpower, laughter and Red Bull\".",
      "Along the way, they told journalists their origin story more times than they care to count. Eventually, they got tired of the \"boring\" reality (they met studying music at Leeds Conservatoire) and started inventing less prosaic stories.",
      "\"We said we were distant relatives who met at a wedding 20 years ago in Leeds,\" laughs Fontaine.",
      "\"They put us at the odd table. We were sort of like the outcasts,\" adds Whiting, continuing the story.",
      "\"But we really clicked,\" says Fontaine. \"We started talking about Shakira and how we wanted to be like her, then they played Hips Don't Lie at the disco and we said, 'We should start a band'.\"",
      "English Teacher, it should be noted, sound nothing like Shakira. They started out as a dream-pop outfit called Frank and, after the addition of Whiting on guitar, began to lean into a more angular, post-punk sound.",
      "Key references include Radiohead, Sonic Youth and Pavement. \"But, famously, we don't agree on our favourite bands,\" says Whiting.",
      "One of their first releases was a demo of The World's Biggest Paving Slab, which they put out independently in 2020.",
      "Like many of their songs, it draws inspiration from Fontaine's hometown of Colne in Lancashire, where the titular paving stone resides outside the town hall.",
      "The lyrics reference a host of local heroes \u2013 from Life On Mars actor John Simm to novelist Charlotte Bronte \u2013 juxtaposing the colour and vigour of the town's history against the social problems it faces in the current day.",
      "It's an itch she continues to scratch throughout the band's catalogue, addressing social deprivation and political mismanagement (\"Can the river stop its banks from bursting? / Blame the council, not the rain\") alongside themes of identity, self-doubt and emotional turbulence.",
      "Incredibly, she only started writing relatively recently. As a teenager, she'd been in a wedding band with her friend, playing Amy Winehouse and Adele covers. She didn't consider composing until she applied for university.",
      "\"I wrote my first song for the audition,\" she recalls. \"It was awful, but it worked. I got a place to study singing and performance, but I very quickly switched to composition, because I was suddenly spending all my time writing songs.\"",
      "Defying convention",
      "During that period, English Teacher's members \u2013 completed by drummer Douglas Frost and bassist Nicholas Eden \u2013 circled each other on Leeds' live music scene, playing with various other bands before settling on their current line-up.",
      "Their breakthrough came with 2021's R&B, their official debut single, where Fontaine addresses the challenge of being a woman of colour fronting an indie band: (\"Despite appearances, I haven't got the voice for R&B\").",
      "It's a perception she struggled with herself as a teenager, frustrated that she wasn't capable of \"the kind of the vocal runs that the black singers I looked up to were able to do\".",
      "As a frontwoman, she developed her own style \u2013 a droll mixture of sprechgesang and her fluttering, airy upper register. But she still encountered prejudice.",
      "\"There'd be times where I told people that I made music, and they'd give a certain expression when I said that it was guitar music or it was indie music,\" she says.",
      "\"There were a lot of small comments after gigs. People would come up and say, 'Oh, that's not what I was expecting at all',\" adds Whiting.",
      "Fontaine is careful not to make too big an issue of it. \"I think I've got a lot of privilege, because I'm quite a light skinned woman of colour,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if I was dark skinned it would be even harder - but it did affect me, not seeing people who looked like me in bands.",
      "\"I think it made me start a band later in life. Maybe I would have started when I was a teenager, and not when I was leaving university.\"",
      "English Teacher's early songs gained an audience during the first wave of the Covid pandemic \u2013 which meant they didn't get to play a gig together until the lockdown ended.",
      "Their first show was as part of an all-day mini festival in May 2021, where the audience still had to be seated and socially distanced.",
      "\"Those first gigs were kind of jarring,\" Whiting recalls. \"It was quite strange because everything up 'til then felt very online, which doesn't feel as tangible. And then when you go and play a gig, it's like, 'Yeah, this is actually going somewhere.'\"",
      "\"We were so nervous, too,\" says Fontaine. \"I feel like it was only late into 2023 that we really found our confidence.\"",
      "By that point, they were deep into recording their debut album with Italian producer Marta Salogni (Bjork, Depeche Mode, MIA) \u2013 including new, more polished versions of R&B and The World's Biggest Paving Slab.",
      "The band say they put \"immense pressure\" on themselves to perfect the record, fixating on its push-pull dynamics, adding extra layers of context, and experimenting with new instruments.",
      "\"It was an intense time in our personal lives, trying to get it finished and out. We gave a lot to it,\" says Whiting.",
      "\"Recording your first album is just a huge opportunity,\" continues Fontaine. \"I think we were very aware of that.\"",
      "The hard work paid off.",
      "Record Collector Magazine called This Could Be Texas \"one of the most confident and charismatic debuts in years\". The Mercury Prize judges said the band's \"winning lyrical mix of surrealism and social observation... displays a fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format\".",
      "The quartet are endearingly amazed that anyone paid attention at all.",
      "\"I wasn't sure that it would connect with people, because the lyrics are quite specific to the area I grew up in,\" says Fontaine.",
      "Instead, it was the bigger themes \u2013 of leaving home and finding your place in a world that's \"going up in flames\" \u2013 that helped them find an ever-growing audience.",
      "On The World's Biggest Paving Slab, Fontaine mockingly describes herself as \"the world's smallest celebrity\" \u2013 a lyric that's rapidly becoming obsolete.",
      "\"I'm not the smallest, but certainly not the biggest,\" she laughs.",
      "\"In the alphabet of celebrity, I'm probably on the X-list.\"",

    "summary": "Being the UK's new City of Culture is a chance for Bradford to challenge prejudices against the city.",
    "story": [
      "As Bradford begins its year as UK City of Culture, it is not just trying to show a different face to the rest of the country - it's also hoping to win over doubters in the city.",
      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",
      "\"The working title for this play was 'Bradford, City of Culture?!' because we knew that's what the reaction would be when people found out we would be the City of Culture for 2025,\" he explains.",
      "Ahad eventually settled on the excellent title Bilal and Ted's Bradfordian Adventure, and it's on BBC Sounds. One of the actors is Seeta Wrightson, a comedian from the city.",
      "\"I think it's really unfairly got a bad rep. And I think that's because in the news or on social media, people don't want to talk about good things.\"",
      "'Why is Bradford so\u2026?'",
      "Wrightson's not wrong.",
      "The headlines about Bradford are often brutal. In recent months, news stories have declared it Britain's gloomiest city (because it has the least sunshine) and the second most miserable place to live.",
      "Type the words \"Why is Bradford so\u2026.?\" into a search engine and see what happens.  The odds are you will probably get the following autofill options - \"bad\", \"dangerous\" and \"poor\".",
      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",
      "Much of it, he believes, is rooted in an external and almost \"ideological hostility\" to the city's ethnic diversity.",
      "\"I think there's a reluctance to admit that Bradford can succeed. A desire for Bradford to fail.\"",
      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "City of Culture has for many become a moment to look beyond the problems and champion what's growing out of its diversity.",
      "People feel welcomed",
      "Natalie Davies, an actor and writer from Bradford, is creating a play about the city's nightlife.",
      "\"The stigma that's been attached for years is old now, and that's not what Bradford is.",
      "\"I'm very lucky. I've worked in television, I've worked in film, I've worked in theatre and radio, and every time I go on to a set, I always champion Bradford.",
      "\"This is actually a great place, and the thing about it is anybody from anywhere could come to Bradford and feel like they belong and we hold that. People come and completely feel welcomed.",
      "\"It's beautiful.\"",
      "City of Culture has also been a chance for people to take stock of Bradford's cultural history and the famous names that have come from here.",
      "Among them are artist David Hockney, playwright JB Priestley, composer Delius and the Bronte sisters.",
      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.  And again and again, talking to younger Bradfordians, while some might mention the Brontes, the spectacular Victorian architecture, the first free school meals or the diversity - almost everyone seems to agree that the city's food is key.",
      "Of course, no two people ever seem to agree as to where you can get the best curry, but perhaps one of the best known restaurants is Akbar's, famous for the creation of the giant hanging naan.",
      "Created to save space on a table, the family naan grew to a size that has defeated even the largest Yorkshire appetite.",
      "\"People have tried. None have succeeded,\" says Samad Iqbal, who started working at Akbar's aged 15 and is a proud ambassador for a city that describes itself as the Capital of Curry.",
      "\"Some people call it elephant ears. Some people call it a Christmas tree. But this family naan has gone worldwide.",
      "\"I am very proud of Bradford, I'm born and bred here. It's a fantastic place to live, a fantastic place to eat. It's places like this which show the true spirit of Bradford.\"",
      "It appears Bradford 2025 has already begun to have an effect. It has, says Dr Sullivan, encouraged people to talk positively about the city.",
      "\"In the last couple of years we have seen a change. I am speaking from opinion here now rather than research, but I think we have seen a shift towards civic pride, and I think the catalyst for that really coming to fruition will be Bradford 2025.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:46:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

      "Quantifying exactly what those percentages mean is tricky, because everyone's risk of bowel cancer is different depending on their lifestyle, diet, habits and genetics.",
      "What does calcium do? What foods contain it?",
      "Calcium is an important mineral for strengthening bones and keeping your teeth healthy, but there is growing evidence it also protects against some cancers.",
      "There is lots of calcium in milk, yoghurt and cheese. Dairy products are one of the main sources of it in the UK diet (we love our cereals in the morning).",
      "It is also present in other foods like soya and rice drinks, white bread, nuts, seeds and fruits like dried figs, curly kale and canned sardines, and it is also in lactose-free milk.",
      "The study says calcium may protect against bowel cancer \"because it is able to bind to bile acids and free fatty acids in the colon, lowering their potentially carcinogenic effects\".",

      "There are about 44,000 cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, making it the fourth most common cancer.",

    "summary": "The surge in mental health referrals among young people has prompted debate among experts about the cause - and the most effective solution",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "Listen to this article",
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:45:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Pictures from China, where cases of the virus are surging, have people worried on social media.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, scenes of hospitals in China overrun with masked people have made their rounds on social media, sparking worries of another pandemic.",
      "Beijing has since acknowledged a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV), especially among children, and it attributed this to a seasonal spike.",
      "But HMPV is not like Covid-19, public health experts have said, noting that the virus has been around for decades, with almost every child being infected by their fifth birthday.",
      "However, in some very young children and people with weakened immune systems, it can cause more serious illness. Here is what you need to know.",
      "What is HMPV and how does it spread?",
      "HMPV is a virus that will lead to a mild upper respiratory tract infection - practically indistinguishable from flu - for most people.",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, the virus spreads through direct contact between people or when someone touches surfaces contaminated with it.",
      "Symptoms for most people include cough, fever and nasal congestion.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus, along with those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, says Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases physician in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" among the immunocompromised will develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring - some experts say this is because the viruses survive better in the cold and they pass more easily from one person to another as people stay indoors more often.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "In fact many countries in the northern hemisphere, including but not limited to China, are experiencing an increased prevalence of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "Data from health authorities in the US and UK shows that these countries, too, have been experiencing a spike in HMPV cases since October last year.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "story": [
      "When you think of new year's resolutions, a 75-day workout might not top the list.",
      "But that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.",
      "First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.",
      "Plus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book.",
      "Easy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.",
      "'New areas for me to tackle'",
      "Meet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.",
      "\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"",
      "Devamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet.",
      "\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.",
      "But since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far.",
      "\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.",
      "While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.",
      "He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan.",
      "He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich.",
      "More relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.",
      "'My family and friends were blown away'",
      "Sophie Deakins, 27, also completed 75 Hard last year while working as an assistant manager at a London cinema.",
      "She says she undertook the challenge after struggling \"with discipline and consistency\" with other plans.",
      "She overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.",
      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",
      "\"But the biggest thing is probably a mindset shift - the encouragement I got from knowing I can do it, the excuses about time and self-doubt are all gone,\" she says.",
      "Pros and cons of the challenge",
      "But the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.",
      "\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",
      "He also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.",
      "\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.",
      "Hitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.",
      "While the challenge encourages people to take progress pictures each day, much of the TikTok content around it focuses on how the person feels at the end rather than how they look, helping to avoid unhealthy fixations with appearance.",

      "Social housing tenants creating \"mayhem and misery\" must be stopped, MPs have agreed.",
      "Reform UK MP Lee Anderson called for a crackdown on \"feral families\" with a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy if neighbours were affected by antisocial behaviour.",
      "In a surprise twist, Labour MP Steve Yemm labelled the plan \"too liberal and lenient\" and demanded a zero tolerance policy.",
      "Responding in the Westminster Hall debate, Labour housing minister Alex Norris admitted current eviction laws \"don't always work\" and said tougher action was being worked on by the government.",
      "Aim for no-fault eviction ban to be in place by summer",
      "'I had panic attacks after my eviction notice'",
      "'Anti-social behaviour makes me scared all the time'",
      "MPs debate issues they are concerned about in Westminster Hall, a room next to the House of Commons, but it does not lead to a change in the law.",
      "Anderson said he set up the debate on antisocial behaviour because it \"destroys and ruins lives\" and was blighting \"every constituency throughout our great country\".",
      "Claiming the threat of eviction could transform offenders into good tenants, the Ashfield MP said: \"We need a deterrent.... I believe in a 'three strikes and out' rule.\"",
      "Responding to questions about where evicted tenants would live, he said: \"I'm not bothered about where they go.",
      "\"I've got two options for these people - they can either behave themselves and become good tenants, good neighbours, and integrate.",
      "\"Or they could do what other people do, normal people - go and get a job, stop committing crime, save some money up, work hard, save a deposit... and then go and private rent somewhere.\"",
      "However, neighbouring MP for Mansfield in the East Midlands, Steve Yemm, said asking victims of antisocial behaviour to spend years collecting and providing evidence of three breaches was too much.",
      "The Labour MP said: \"I would argue that this proposition is somewhat too liberal and lenient and doesn't go far enough to address the issues.\"",
      "Intervening, Anderson responded he was \"astounded\" and asked Yemm to agree to a \"one-strike and you're out\" rule instead.",
      "Yemm answered \"that's exactly what I'm saying\", adding victims - the majority of them women - had to \"endure... many, many years of suffering under this type of abuse\" and too many were then told no action could be taken.",
      "\"This should be a zero tolerance policy,\" Yemm said, adding council powers should be bolstered so upstanding citizens could enjoy \"peace and security\" in their homes.",
      "Another Labour MP, Andrew Cooper, said the authorities also needed to stop dumping tenants \"grappling with addiction\" into social housing without adequate support and called for more preventative action.",
      "Liberal Democrat housing spokesman Gideon Amos said the best deterrent would be better funding for police and councils to use the powers they already have.",
      "He set out how existing powers already allowed for \"one strike\" eviction in the worst cases, so Anderson's plan would only \"make the law weaker and give comfort to the most antisocial culprits\".",
      "The MP for Taunton and Wellington, who is also a social housing landlord, added: \"Simply evicting tenants onto the streets won't reduce antisocial behaviour, it will move the antisocial behaviour from the house to the street where all the evidence suggest it will only get worse.\"",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said social housing should be \"a privilege not a right\" and the public only wanted \"decent and hardworking people that have contributed to this country\" to be given social housing.",
      "The Conservative MP said: \"It's good to see across the House today we seem to be in violent agreement about the three strikes policy, which seems to be a maximum not a minimum.\"",
      "Housing minister Alex Norris called attention to the Labour government's Safer Streets focus on boosting police numbers to tackle antisocial behaviour and the new Respect Orders, which he said should be toughened up.",
      "He said: \"Crucially I think there is a significant gap at the moment for those who make persistent offences, that those penalties [should] grow and are serious ones.\"",
      "Norris said there was also ongoing work on the Renters' Rights Bill, with new powers for social landlords to seek evictions \"immediately in the most serious cases\" and for judges to take the offenders' engagement with efforts to support them into account.",
      "However, he also highlighted how a home could be \"a real foundation\" for families and said there should still be a focus on supporting those, particularly single mums, who were struggling."

The list also includes Atomwaffen Division, Feuerkrieg Division, Sonnenkrieg Division, The Base and The Terrorgram collective.",

      "Cooper said the change would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill this spring.",
      "Two more recommendations being acted on include grooming being an aggravating factor in the sentencing of child sexual offences, and that the government would \"overhaul\" the information and evidence gathered on child sexual abuse and exploitation.",
      "Alex Davies-Jones, the government's minister for victims and violence against women and girls, said a date had not been fixed for when all recommendations will be implemented.",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"We have been in government for six months - the previous government had years to implement these recommendations and sat on their hands instead of actually acting.\"",
      "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has called for a national inquiry and said \"what we've learnt more recently is the sheer scale of what is happening\".",
      "\"The Jay Review, for example, looked at six towns. We now suspect at least 50 towns have had grooming gangs of this kind,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "Asked whether the Conservatives had done enough to tackle the issue in government, Jenrick said \"more needs to be done\".",
      "He said he had \"long advocated for a full-life sentence if you are a grooming gang perpetrator\".",
      "On the Today programme, Jenrick was questioned about his previous claim of a link between grooming gangs and \"importing hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures who possess medieval attitudes towards women\".",
      "Jenrick said British-Pakistani men were \"over-represented as members of these rape gangs\".",
      "Asked if he was saying people from Pakistan have a medieval culture, he replied: \"I think some people who come from that country do - I'm not saying everybody.\"",
      "Prof Jay's inquiry noted that \"many of the high-profile child sexual exploitation prosecutions have involved groups of men from minority ethnic communities\" but a lack of data means it is \"impossible to know whether any particular ethnic group is over-represented as perpetrators of child sexual exploitation by networks\".",
      "Conservative peer Lord Tariq Ahmad accused Jenrick of \"incit[ing] hatred\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, the former minister questioned whether Jenrick was prioritising victims or instead \"trying to play to a particular audience to incite... particular views against particular communities\".",
      "\"The heritage or faith\" of criminals should not be blamed, he said.",
      "\"We've got to deal with these individuals as they are - as criminals, and not demonise a whole community,\" he added.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said his party would be prepared to set up an unofficial inquiry into grooming gangs if the government did not act within \"a few weeks\".",
      "He told LBC radio he could raise the money to fund an inquiry, although it would not have legal powers to compel witnesses to attend.",
      "\"I will have no difficulty in raising the money to do this, whatsoever. We'll appoint independent ex-judges and experts,\" Farage said.",
      "What were Prof Jay's recommendations?",
      "The IICSA national inquiry was set up in 2015 and carried out 15 investigations, including into grooming gangs and abuse in schools and church settings.",
      "Prof Jay had previously led a landmark local inquiry into widescale abuse in Rotherham, where it was estimated 1,400 children were exploited between 1997 and 2013, predominantly by men of Pakistani heritage.",
      "The final report was published in 2022.",
      "Its 20 recommendations included:",
      "Setting up a national child protection authority, Implementing tighter controls on who can work with vulnerable childrenLegislating to force tech firms to take stronger action over online abuse material Making not reporting abuse a criminal offence.",

      "Musk has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" and suggested Sir Keir had failed to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions.",
      "Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Sir Keir defended his record in his former role, saying when he left \"we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record\".",
      "He said he enjoyed robust debate but it had to be \"based on facts and truth, not on lies\".",
      "Maggie Oliver, a former Greater Manchester Police (GMP) detective who resigned in 2012 over poor handling of abuse cases in Rochdale, said it had taken \"an international spotlight on our country\" to prompt the measures announced by the home secretary.",
      "She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that \"nothing had happened in the two-and-a-half years since those recommendations were made\".",
      "Ms Oliver said she was unsure if victims wanted a new national inquiry, adding: \"The question has to be, what is the public inquiry for? Who will lead it? What are the terms of reference? Are victims and survivors going to be front and central? I would also argue that we fully know what the problem is and the time is for action.\"",
      "Ms Oliver also said she had spoken to victims who were \"raging\" about the prime minister's remarks on Monday. It comes after Sir Keir hit out at politicians \"calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far-right\".",
      "The prime minister's spokesman later said that not all those calling for a new inquiry into child grooming are on the far-right.",
      "But Ms Oliver said victims she had spoken to felt it was \"accusing anyone who is concerned about this problem of being a far-right racist\"."

      "More than half of companies are planning to raise prices in the next three months as they face a \"pressure cooker of rising costs and taxes\", according to one of the UK's largest business groups.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said its survey of nearly 5,000 firms suggested confidence had \"slumped\", falling to its lowest level for two years.",
      "Nearly two-thirds told the BCC they were worried about taxes following the Budget, which announced a rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by firms from April.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said the Budget delivered stability for business and more than half of employers would either see a cut or no change in their NI bills.",
      "Raising prices risks stoking inflation at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living.",
      "While the rate of inflation - which measures the pace of prices rises - has fallen sharply from record highs in 2022, it rose in both October and November.",
      "The BCC's survey, which was conducted after the Budget, found that more than half - 55% - of firms expected to raise their prices in the next three months, up from the previous reading of 39%.",
      "Shevaun Haviland, the BCC's director general, told the BBC that in the face of higher costs \"there's only so many things you can do\".",
      "\"You've got to think about putting up prices... or you've got to take that hit in your margin, which means you have less money to invest in the future, or you've got to look at your recruitment and staff costs. So it's really, really tough.\"",
      "A closely-watched survey of the services sector by S&P Global suggested that in December the sector had cut jobs at the fastest pace for nearly four years.",
      "\"Faced with subdued demand conditions and hikes to employment costs, many service providers opted to curtail their staff hiring and delay backfilling roles,\" said Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence",

      "The strength of the UK economy has come under focus following the release of disappointing growth figures just before Christmas.",

      "The figures were seen as a blow to the Labour government after it made boosting the economy its top priority.",
      "A separate report from KPMG has forecast that the pace of growth will pick up this year, with the economy growing by 1.7% compared with 0.8% in 2024.",
      "It expects consumers to \"ramp up the pace of spending\" as household incomes are boosted by stonger pay growth and lower interest rates.",

      "Kevin McNamee, chief executive of Denroy Group, a manufacturer of plastic goods based near Belfast that employs 250 people, told the BBC the combined impact of the changes to the minimum wage and national insurance would cost the company \"hundreds of thousands of pounds, it's really significant\".",
      "It was \"probably inevitable\" the prices on some of their goods would have to rise to try to cover the higher costs, he said.",
      "\"The focus now will be on boosting productivity, reducing headcount or certainly not adding to the headcount as the business grows and driving that productivity.\"",
      "He added businesses had been \"shocked\" by the changes to national insurance.",
      "\"It's hard to see how the Budget incentivises businesses to invest to grow, we've had our pockets picked to an extent here.\"",
      "However, the owner and director of Hays Travel, Dame Irene Hays, told the BBC that she was not seeing a lack of confidence in the travel sector.",
      "Bookings at the firm - which employs about 3,500 people - are up 22% so far this year, she told the Today programme.",

      "Farage suggested this was due to a disagreement over Musk's support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.",
      "He said Musk's comment was \"a surprise\", but that he would \"never sell out my principles\".",

      "Robinson admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",

      "Musk's father Errol has suggested the SpaceX and Tesla mogul might even be prepared to become a UK citizen to make a $100m (\u00a380.5 m) donation to Reform UK. Farage later said speculation about the figure was \"for the birds\".",
      "As a US citizen, Musk cannot make personal political donations in the UK - but could make one through the British branch of his company X.",

      "Musk has spent the week amplifying calls by Reform UK and the Conservative Party for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "The calls came after the government turned down a request to conduct an inquiry into historical cases of sexual abuse in Oldham, saying the council should lead it instead.",

      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",

      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",

      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",

      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",

      "Questions about the conduct of local authorities, the police and social care needed answering on a national scale, he argued. Philp also did not rule out the inquiry looking at the role of Sir Keir Starmer, who was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013.",
      "He said an inquiry should examine why perpetrators in \"grooming gangs and rape gangs\" appeared to be \"overwhelmingly of South Asian background\".",

      "In July, Oldham Council, which is led by a Labour minority administration, asked the Home Office to lead a fuller inquiry into historical abuse in the area.",
      "Phillips rejected the request, pointing to council-run inquiries in Rotherham and Telford, which she argued had greater legitimacy because they were locally commissioned and delivered.",

      "\"Nigel is not for sale,\" is how one senior party figure put it to me, saying this showed that the Reform leader was willing to stand up to anybody, including the richest man in the world.",
      "Another said that if Reform were to be treated as a serious political outfit - and remember, Nigel Farage has said he wants to win the next general election - that means robustly and consistently rejecting any association with Robinson, whatever the consequences.",
      "The one politician to attract some praise from Elon Musk, for now at least, is the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, for her calls for a public inquiry into child sexual abuse.",
      "Badenoch sees the scandal as a case study in what she sees as our broken politics.",
      "For Badenoch, 2025 will be a crucial year as she fights to rebuild her party and fights for attention \u2013 not easy, when Nigel Farage is around.",
      "She got yet another taste of that over Christmas in a very public row with him over party membership numbers: Badenoch suggested Reform's claim on Boxing Day to have overtaken the Tories' membership numbers were \"fake\" as their tally was automatically rising.",
      "Reform invited journalists to verify that this was not the case and the Financial Times among others concluded there was \"strong evidence\" the party's tally was accurate.",
      "In the coming weeks, we can expect to hear from Badenoch about the so-called Policy Commissions she is setting up, and who will lead them.",
      "It will be worth keeping an eye too on the man she beat to the leadership, Robert Jenrick, who hasn't exactly gone quietly.",
      "He is her shadow justice secretary but his willingness to carry on campaigning almost as if the leadership race was still on is irking some senior Tories, who want him to stay in his lane on policy and not stray all over the place talking about whatever he likes.",
      "As for the prime minister, a bruising first six months into office and with noises off at home and abroad, his big hope is delivery.",
      "He is forgoing the usual new year big picture speech as his team feel he did just that with his big speech last month.",
      "Instead, he is focusing on a specific promise: getting hospital waiting lists down in England.",
      "He will do similar style events and visits in the coming weeks on the government's other big promises.",
      "So here goes with politics in 2025.",
      "We are not even a week in and it is proving lively already.",

    "title": "Starmer's NHS waiting list plan - will it work?",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 21:02:19 GMT",
    "summary": "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK seems to have momentum, but will it last?",
    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",

      "The charity Buglife said active worker bumblebees, which do most of the work in a nest, were spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather over the Christmas break.",
      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",
      "Buglife said the nests were at a \"high risk\" of failing because of the shortage of flowers for the bees to collect nectar and pollen from, and the risk of a return to colder weather.",
      "Bees teach each other how to problem-solve - study",
      "Caught by the buzz: Saving bees is 'the best job'",
      "Scientists have previously said climate change had caused a widespread loss of bumblebees across the world.",
      "The insects, an important pollinator, normally hibernate through winter into spring.",
      "The Christmas period was unseasonably mild, but since then there have been days of cold and snowy weather.",
      "Buglife said at least two of the UK's 25 species of bumblebee were believed to have started nest-building early.",
      "The charity's Paul Hetherington said: \"In 2019 Buglife ran a bee survey over the Christmas to New Year break and were amazed at the results with honeybees and bumblebees found from Jersey through to Thurso.",
      "\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break.",
      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",

      "He added: \"If this happens there will be no new queens produced meaning far fewer to emerge in spring further feeding the known decline in bumblebees.\"",

      "Over winter, adult ticks do not hibernate and instead shelter from low temperatures in long vegetation.",
      "Mr Hetherington said: \"This means that they are still potentially active and the period around 28 December was relatively warm for the time of year, a likely consequence of climate change is increased periods of tick activity in the same way that bumblebees have been spotted on the wing across Scotland this December.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network.

      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",

      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

      "Several destinations for the whales have been proposed but there is disagreement on where they should go and what should happen to them.",
      "Most experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.",

      "Wikie and Keijo could then use the large expanse of water, with human support from vets and welfare workers, until the end of their lives.",
      "The average lifespan of a male killer whale is about 30 years, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. Females usually live about 50 years.",

      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",

      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",

      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",

      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",

      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",

      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",

      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",

      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "He will be replaced by his current deputy and Republican Joel Kaplan, who previously served as deputy chief of staff in the White House during President George W Bush's administration, and is known for handling the company's relations with Republicans.",
      "He added that he would spend \"a few months handing over the reins\" and representing Facebook at international gatherings before moving on to \"new adventures\".",
      "Sir Nick's resignation comes just weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "The president-elect has repeatedly accused Meta and other platforms of censorship and silencing conservative speech.",
      "His relations with Mr Zuckerberg have been particularly strained, after Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts for two years in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January.",
      "More recently, Trump threatened to imprison Mr Zuckerberg if he interfered in the 2024 election, and even called Facebook an \"enemy of the people\" in March.",

      "In a statement announcing he would step down, Sir Nick said his successor Joel Kaplan is \"quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time\".",

      "Sir Nick leaving Meta, and increased political polarisation on social platforms, suggests the company may shift how it moderates political speech, she added.",

      "During his time at Meta, Sir Nick established himself not only as a spokesperson but also a bridge between governments, regulators and the tech firm.",
      "As new regulation and legislation began to force social media companies to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and the consequences of it, that role became crucial.",
      "He oversaw the creation of the Oversight Board, an independent body set up to oversee Meta's content moderation decisions.",
      "He said recently, however, that the firm's actions had resulted in some people being \"unfairly penalised\" on its platforms too often.",
      "Sir Nick has also been open about his views on Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, describing him as a political puppet master, claiming he has turned X, formerly Twitter, into a \"one-man hyper-partisan hobby horse\".",
      "The former Liberal Democrat leader moved to Silicon Valley initially but returned to London in 2022.",
      "He said he was moving on to \"new adventures\" with \"immense gratitude and pride\" at what he had been part of.",

      "The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.",
      "After the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.",
      "In 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.",
      "\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"",
      "China and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals.",
      "On Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region.",
      "\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said.",
      "Trump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added.",
      "\"Today, of special interest are the rare earth minerals, which have not yet been mined but are in the southern part of Greenland. These are immensely important in all kinds of technologies, from cell phones to wind turbines.\"",
      "Does the US want full control of Greenland?",
      "Trump has claimed that control of Greenland is essential to US national and economic security.",
      "Though the president-elect's rhetoric may seen unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.",
      "\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.",
      "In 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.",
      "In 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.",
      "Trump also tried to buy Greenland during his first term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "What do the people of Greenland think?",
      "Kuno Fencker, a member of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, said on Wednesday that he didn't see Trump's comments as a threat.",
      "Fencker, who supports Greenlandic independence, told  the BBC that a sovereign Greenland could choose to co-operate with the US on defence.",
      "But when Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal.",
      "\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.",
      "\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.",
      "\"He's not even talking to Greenland - he's talking to Denmark about buying Greenland.\""

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:21:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Immigration has long been a polarising issue in the West but Canada mostly avoided it - until now",
    "story": [
      "Immigration has long been a polarising issue in the West but Canada mostly avoided it - until now. With protests and campaign groups springing up in certain quarters, some argue that this - together with housing shortages and rising rents - contributed to Justin Trudeau's resignation. But could Donald Trump's arrival inflame it further?",
      "At first glance, the single bedroom for rent in Brampton, Ontario looks like a bargain. True, there's barely any floor space, but the asking price is only C$550 (\u00a3300) a month in a Toronto suburb where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom flat is C$2,261. Inspect it more closely, however, and this is actually a small bathroom converted into sleeping quarters. A mattress is jammed up next to the sink, the toilet is nearby.",
      "The ad, originally posted on Facebook Marketplace, has generated hundreds of comments online. \"Disgusting,\" wrote one Reddit user. \"Hey 20-somethings, you're looking at your future,\" says another.",
      "But there are other listings like it - one room for rent, also in Brampton, shows a bed squashed near a staircase in what appears to be a laundry area. Another rental in Scarborough, a district in Ontario, offers a double bed in the corner of a kitchen.",
      "While Canada might have a lot of space, there aren't enough homes and in the past three years, rents across the country have increased by almost 20%, according to property consultancy Urbanation.",
      "In all, some 2.4 million Canadian families are crammed into homes that are too small, in urgent need of major repairs or are seriously unaffordable, a government watchdog report released in December has suggested.",
      "This accommodation shortage has come to a head at the same time that inflation is hitting Canadians hard - and these issues have, in turn, moved another issue high up the agenda in the country: immigration.",
      "For the first time a majority of Canadians, who have long been welcoming to newcomers, are questioning how their cities can manage.",
      "Politics in other Western countries has long been wrapped up in polarised debates surrounding immigration but until recently Canada had mostly avoided that issue, perhaps because of its geography. Now, however, there appears to be a profound shift in attitude.",
      "In 2022, 27% of Canadians said there were too many immigrants coming into the country, according to a survey by data and research organisation the Environics Institute for Survey Research. By 2024, that number had increased to 58%.",
      "Campaign groups have sprung up too and there have been marches protesting against immigration in Ottawa, Vancouver and Calgary, and elsewhere around the country.",
      "\"I would say it was very much taboo, like no one would really talk about it,\" explains Peter Kratzar, a software engineer and the founder of Cost of Living Canada, a protest group that was formed in 2024. \"[But] things have really unfrozen.\"",
      "Stories like that of the bathroom for rent in Brampton have fuelled this, he suggests: \"People might say, like, this is all anecdotal evidence. But the evidence keeps popping up. You see it over and over again.\"",
      "\"People became concerned about how the immigration system was being managed,\" adds Keith Neuman, executive director at the Environics Institute for Survey Research. \"And we believe it's the first time the public really thought about the management of the system.\"",

      "Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?",
      "Why the Trudeau era has come to an end now",
      "What happens next for Canada?",
      "Once the golden boy of Canadian politics, prime minister Justin Trudeau, resigned on 6 January during a crucial election year, amid this widespread discontent over immigration levels.",
      "His approval levels before his resignation were just 22% - a far cry from the first year of his premiership, when 65% of voters said they approved of him.",
      "Though immigration is not the main reason for his low approval levels nor his resignation - he cited \"having to fight internal battles\" - he was accused of acting too late when dealing with rising anxiety over inflation and housing that many blamed, in part, on immigration.",
      "\"While immigration may not have been the immediate cause of the resignation, it may have been the icing on the cake,\" says Professor Jonathan Rose, head of the department of political studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.",
      "Under Trudeau's administration, the Canadian government deliberately chose to radically boost the numbers of people coming to the country after the pandemic, believing that boosting quotas for foreign students and temporary workers, in addition to skilled immigrants, would jumpstart the economy.",
      "The population, which was 35 million 10 years ago, now tops 40 million.",
      "Immigration was responsible for the vast majority of that increase - figures from Canada's national statistics agency show that in 2024, more than 90% of population growth came from immigration.",
      "As well as overall migration levels, the number of refugees has risen too. In 2013, there were 10,365 refugee applicants in Canada - by 2023, that number had increased to 143,770.",
      "Voter dissatisfaction with immigration was \"more a symptom than a cause\" of Trudeau's downfall, argues Prof Rose. \"It reflects his perceived inability to read the room in terms of public opinion.\"",
      "It's unclear who might replace Trudeau from within his own Liberal Party but ahead of the forthcoming election, polls currently favour the Conservative Party, whose leader Pierre Poilievre advocates keeping the number of new arrivals below the number of new homes being built.",
      "Since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November, Poilievre \"has been speaking much more about immigration\", claims Prof Rose - \"so much that it has become primed in the minds of voters\".",
      "Certainly Trump's arrival for a second term is set to pour oil on an already inflamed issue in Canada, regardless of who the new prime minister is.",
      "He won the US election in part on a pledge to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants - and since his victory, he has said that he will enlist the military and declare a national emergency to follow through on his promise.",
      "He also announced plans to employ 25% tariffs on Canadian goods unless border security is tightened.",
      "Drones, cameras and policing the border",
      "Canada and the US share the world's longest undefended border. Stretching almost 9,000km (5,592 miles), much of it crosses heavily forested wilderness and is demarcated by \"The Slash,\" a six-metre wide land clearing.",
      "Unlike America's southern border, there are no walls. This has long been a point of pride between Ottawa and Washington - a sign of their close ties.",
      "After Trump first entered office in 2017,  the number of asylum claims skyrocketed, with thousands walking across the border to Canada. The number of claims went from just under 24,000 in 2016 to 55,000 a year by 2018, according to the Canadian government. Almost all crossed from New York state into the Canadian province of Quebec.",
      "In 2023, Canada and the US agreed to a tightened border deal that stopped most migrants from crossing the land border from one country to another. Under the agreement, migrants that come into contact with the authorities within 14 days of crossing any part of the border into either the US or Canada must return to whichever country they entered first \u2014 in order to declare asylum there.",
      "The deal, reworked by Trudeau and Joe Biden, is based on the idea that both the US and Canada are safe countries for asylum seekers.",
      "This time around, Canada's national police force \u2013 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) \u2013 says it began preparing a contingency plan for increased migrant crossings at the border well ahead of Trump being sworn in.",
      "This includes a raft of new technology, from drones and night vision goggles, to surveillance cameras hidden in the forest.",
      "\"Worst-case scenario would be people crossing in large numbers everywhere on the territory,\" RCMP spokesperson Charles Poirier warned in November. \"Let's say we had 100 people per day entering across the border, then it's going to be hard because our officers will basically have to cover huge distances in order to arrest everyone.\"",
      "Now, the national government has committed a further C$1.3bn (\u00a3555m) to its border security plan.",
      "'We want our future back!'",
      "Not everyone blames the housing crisis on the recent rise in immigration. It was \"30 years in the making\" because politicians have failed to build affordable units, argues Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow.",
      "Certainly the country has a long history of welcoming newcomers. \"Close to 50% of the population of Canada is first or second generation,\" explains Mr Neuman. \"That means either they came from another country, or one or both of their parents came from another country. In Toronto, Vancouver, that's over 80%.\"",
      "This makes Canada \"a very different place than a place that has a homogeneous population,\" he argues.",
      "He has been involved in a survey examining attitudes towards newcomers for 40 years. \"If you ask Canadians: what's the most important or distinctive thing about Canada, or what makes the country unique? The number one response is 'multiculturalism' or 'diversity',\" he says.",
      "Nonetheless, he says the shift in public opinion - and the rise in concerns about immigration - has been \"dramatic\".",
      "\"Now there is not only broader public concern, but much more open discussion,\" he says. \"There are more questions being asked about how is the system working? How come it isn't working?\"",
      "At one of the protests in Toronto, a crowd turned out with hand-painted signs, some proclaiming: \"We want our future back!\" and \"End Mass Immigration\".",
      "\"We do need to put a moratorium on immigration,\" argues Mr Kratzar, whose group has taken part in some of them. \"We need to delay that so wages can catch up on the cost of rents.\"",
      "Accusations against newcomers are spreading on social media too. Last summer, Natasha White, who describes herself as a resident of Wasaga Beach in Ontario, claimed on TikTok that some newcomers had been digging holes on the beach and defecating in them.",
      "The post generated hundreds of thousands of views and a torrent of anti-foreigner hatred, with many arguing that newcomers should \"go home\".",
      "Tent cities and full homeless shelters",
      "People I interviewed who work closely with asylum seekers in Canada say that the heightened concerns around the need for more border security is making asylum seekers feel unsettled and afraid.",
      "Abdulla Daoud, executive director at the Refugee Center in Montreal, believes that the vulnerable asylum seekers he works with feel singled out by the focus on migrant numbers since the US election. \"They're definitely more anxious,\" he says. \"I think they're coming in and they're feeling, 'Okay, am I going to be welcomed here? Am I in the right place or not?'\"",
      "Those hoping to stay in Canada as refugees can't access official immigration settlement services until it has been decided they truly need asylum. This process once took two weeks but it can now take as long as three years.",
      "Tent cities to house newly-arrived refugees and food banks with empty shelves have sprung up in Toronto. The city's homeless shelters are often reported to be full. Last winter, two refugee applicants froze to death after sleeping on Toronto's streets.",
      "Toronto mayor Olivia Chow, an immigrant herself having moved to Canada from Hong Kong at age 13, says: \"People are seeing that, even with working two jobs or three jobs, they can't have enough money to pay the rent and feed the kids.",
      "\"I understand the hardship of having a life that is not affordable, and the fear of being evicted, absolutely, I get it. But to blame that on the immigration system is unfair.\"",
      "Trudeau: 'We didn't get the balance quite right'",
      "With frustrations growing, Trudeau announced a major change in October: a 20% reduction in immigration targets over three years. \"As we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labour needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance quite right,\" he conceded.",
      "He added that he wanted to give all levels of government time to catch up \u2013 to accommodate more people. But, given that he has since resigned, is it enough? And does the Trump presidency and the increasing anti-immigrant sentiment on that side of the border risk spilling further into Canada?",
      "Mr Daoud has his own view. \"Unfortunately, I think the Trump presidency had its impact on Canadian politics,\" he says. \"I think a lot of politicians are using this as a way to fear-monger.\"",
      "Others are less convinced that it will have much of an impact. \"Canadians are better than that,\" says Olivia Chow. \"We remember that successive waves of refugees helped create Toronto and Canada.\"",
      "Channel migrants: The real reason so many are fleeing Vietnam for the UK",
      "Nigel Farage claims Reform can win power - but how realistic is that?",
      "The endgame in Ukraine: How the war could come to a close in 2025",
      "Politicians wading into the debate around population growth ahead of the next election will be conscious of the fact that half of Canadians are first and second-generation immigrants themselves. \"If the Conservatives win the next election, we can expect a reduction in immigration,\" says Prof Jonathan Rose. But he adds that Poilievre will have to walk \"a bit of fine line\".",
      "Prof Rose says: \"Since immigrant-heavy ridings [constituencies] in Toronto and Vancouver will be important to any electoral victory, he can't be seen as anti-immigration, merely recalibrating it to suit economic and housing policy.\"",
      "And there are a large number of Canadians, including business leaders and academics, who believe that the country must continue to pursue an assertive growth policy to combat Canada's falling birth rate.",
      "\"I really have high hopes for Canadians,\" adds Lisa Lalande of the Century Initiative, which advocates for policies that would see Canada's population increase to 100 million by 2100. \"I actually think we will rise above where we are now.",
      "\"I think we're just really concerned about affordability [and] cost of living - not about immigrants themselves. We recognise they're too important to our culture.\"",

      "Ms Nweke and her staff work around the clock to support him and other youngsters living with permanent brain damage.",
      "Although there is a lack of official data, cerebral palsy is believed to be one of the most common neurological disorders in Nigeria. In 2017, a medical professor from the University of Lagos said 700,000 people had the condition.",
      "For many of those living with cerebral palsy in the country, their condition was caused by a common phenomenon among newborns - neonatal jaundice.",
      "This is caused by a build-up of bilirubin, a yellow substance, in the blood, meaning the babies' skins have a yellow tinge.",
      "Professor Chinyere Ezeaka, a paediatrician at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, tells the BBC that more than 60% of all babies suffer from jaundice.",
      "Most babies recover within days. More severe cases need further medical intervention - and even then the condition is easily treatable.",
      "Children are basically exposed to ultra-violet light to dissolve the excess bilirubin in their red blood cells. The treatment lasts a few days depending on the severity.",
      "However, in Nigeria this treatment is often not immediately available, which is why the country is among the five with the most neurological disorders caused by untreated jaundice in the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "Any treatment for neonatal jaundice \"must occur within the first 10 days of life, else [the condition] could cause permanent brain damage and severe cerebral palsy\", says Prof Ezeaka.",
      "To make matters worse, the West African country lacks facilities to care for those with neurological disorders. There are just three cerebral palsy centres, all privately run, in Nigeria, which has a population of more than 200 million.",
      "Ms Nweke - a single mother - set up the Cerebral Palsy Centre after struggling to find support for her own daughter, Zimuzo.",
      "\"When I took her to a day-care [centre], they asked me to take her back because other mothers would withdraw their children. As a mum, I must say it was quite devastating,\" Ms Nweke tells the BBC.",
      "Zimuzo is now 17, and Ms Nweke's Cerebral Palsy Centre provides full-time support for others with similar experiences.",
      "On the day I visit, colourful playtime mats and toys are neatly arranged on the floor. Mickey Mouse and his friends converse on a wide-screen television in the lounge.",
      "Twelve youngsters, some as young as five, gaze at the TV, their bright environment ignored for a moment. They are all immobile and non-speaking.",
      "At lunchtime, caregivers help the youngsters eat. Some take in liquified food through tubes attached to their stomachs.",
      "Carefully and slowly, the carers support their heads with pillows and push the contents of their syringes into the tubes.",
      "The youngsters are fed every two hours and require regular muscular massages to prevent stiffness.",
      "But they are the lucky 12 receiving free care from the Cerebral Palsy Centre, which is funded exclusively by donors.",
      "The facility has a long waiting list - Ms Nweke has received more than 100 applications.",
      "But taking on more youngsters would require extra financial support. The cost of caring for someone at the centre is at least $1,000 (\u00a3790) a month - a huge amount in a country where the national minimum wage is about $540 a year.",
      "\"As a mum, I must say it's quite overwhelming. You have moments of depression, it gives you heartaches and it is quite expensive - in fact it's the most expensive congenital disorder to manage,\" Ms Nweke says.",
      "\"And then of course, it keeps you away from people because you don't discuss the same things. They are talking of their babies, walking, enjoying those baby moments. You are not doing that. You are sad,\" she adds.",
      "Ms Nweke explains that she adopted Zimuzo from an orphanage.",
      "A few months after taking her new daughter home, Ms Nweke realised Zimuzo was not developing in the same way as the children around her were. She was assessed at a hospital and diagnosed with cerebral palsy.",
      "Ms Nweke was told she could take Zimuzo, who was then just  a few months old, back to the orphanage and adopt another baby instead, but she refused.",
      "\"I decided to keep her and I began researching what the disorder was about, the treatment and type of care my child would need - she's my life.",
      "\"I was also told by the doctors she won't live beyond two years. Well here we are - 17 years later,\" says a smiling Ms Nweke.",
      "A lack of awareness and adequate medical support hinders the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria.",
      "Ms Nweke also says the common local belief that children with congenital disorders are spiritually damaged or bewitched leads to stigmatisation.",
      "Some children with neurological disorders - mostly in Nigeria's rural areas - are labelled witches. In some cases, they are abandoned in prayer houses or cast out of their families.",
      "Ms Nweke is not alone in her mission to dispel myths and improve care.",
      "The Oscar Project - a charity aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal jaundice - recently began operating in Lagos.",
      "The project is named after Vietnamese-born British disability advocate, Oscar Anderson, whose untreated jaundice caused his cerebral palsy.",
      "\"We're equipping health facilities at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels with the equipment to treat jaundice, primarily light boxes, but also detection and screening equipment,\" Toyin Saraki, who oversaw the launch, tells the BBC.",
      "Project Oscar, backed by consumer health firm Reckitt, is training 300 health workers in Lagos. The hope over the first year is to reach 10,000 mothers, screen 9,000 children and introduce new protocols to try and prevent babies with jaundice from developing cerebral palsy.",
      "In a country where the public health system is overstretched, the government has little to say about the disorder, although it lauded the Oscar project's goals.",
      "Treatment for neonatal jaundice is significantly cheaper than the cost of lifelong care, doctors say.",
      "First launched in Vietnam in 2019, Project Oscar has helped about 150,000 children in the Asian country.",
      "Mr Anderson, 22, says he wants to prevent other children experiencing what he has been through.",
      "\"People with disabilities are not to be underestimated,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "He is working to ensure screening for every newborn infant for neonatal jaundice, and, with the support and courage of mums, midwives and medical professionals, ensure there is better understanding and quicker treatment.",
      "However, achieving this is a hugely ambitious goal in Africa's most-populous country, where thousands of babies are born each year with neonatal jaundice.",
      "Regardless, Mr Anderson is determined to defy the odds.",
      "\"The work doesn't stop until every baby is protected against neonatal jaundice,\" he says.",

      "\"Inside Edition\" correspondent Alison Hall is opening up about her breast cancer journey and how actress Olivia Munn's own cancer diagnosis influenced Hall's decision to seek testing. Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",
      "Munn sent \"CBS Mornings\" a statement to deliver to Hall, saying, \"You are now on the path to survival ... By telling your story, you are creating a ripple effect of hope and saving lives.\"",
      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",
      "As Hall prepares for her upcoming surgery, she is grateful for the support of her family and friends, including her husband, whom she calls her \"human support person.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981.

Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",

      "Oprah Winfrey selected Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\" as her latest book club choice. The book encourages readers to find peace and purpose and makes history as the first book to be chosen twice. Read a free excerpt below.",
      "Chapter One",
      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

      "\"About 50% of Americans make a New Year's resolution. Most of them fail. Most of them fail really quickly. And the big reason is because they are too big,\" Brooks said.",

      "Brooks recommended starting with simple resolutions like keeping a gratitude list.",
      "\"The brain is dedicated more to resentment than to gratitude,\" he explained, suggesting people write down five things they're grateful for every Sunday. \"It just takes a minute. You will, within 10 weeks, become 10 to 20% happier and that will become a habit.\"",
      "For those considering bigger changes, like switching careers, Brooks emphasized the need for courage.",
      "\"You have to have a sense of adventure,\" he said. \"You have to know why you are leaving the job you are currently leaving.\"",
      "For those unable to quit their jobs but still seeking happiness, Brooks offered this advice: \"Look for a way to make people happier around you.\"",
      "He gave an example: \"At 2 p.m., you're in your cubicle. The guy next door could use a fresh cup of coffee. You bring it to him, unasked. And look at the look on his face. You'll become that person who brings people things they didn't ask for, and weirdly, you're going to start liking your job more.\"",
      "Brooks also said happiness requires unhappiness.",

    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",

      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",

      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",
      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",
      "Swinton grew up the daughter of a military officer in an aristocratic family in Scotland. When we met, Swinton was looking forward to getting home to her remote seaside town in Scotland, where she raised twins, and has an artist-partner, Sandro Kopp, and a number of springer spaniels.",
      "I asked about descriptions of her as \"an icon of androgynous beauty,\" and naturally radiating \"a certain otherworldliness.\"",
      "\"The otherworldliness does make me laugh a bit,\" she said, \"because the truth is I look like the members of my family. I think the otherworldly might have something to do with the fact that I don't wear mascara and I'm very pale. As my grandmother would say, it would be a dull world if everybody felt the same. I don't feel otherworldly. I feel very much present.\"",
      "Swinton is very much present, whether at an interview or as an actor. And in navigating Hollywood, those roots in Scotland help her find balance.",
      "\"Maybe it's made me braver,\" she said. \"Maybe I wouldn't be able to pack that small bag and engage in worlds that are very alien to where I come from, if I didn't know I was going home to something that feels absolutely real to me.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:12:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:07:03 -0500",
    "summary": "After reaching a tentative deal that suspended a short strike in October, unionized dockworkers and port operators face another crucial test.",
    "story": [
      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0in March. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Healthcare, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",
      "Among those who joined Mr. Biden at the signing ceremony was 17-year-old Eliseo Jimenez, who\u00a0walked from his home in Lubbock, Texas, to Washington, D.C. over 40 days during the summer to raise funds for his charity to help those with disabilities and senior citizens. The teen, now a high school senior, made the trek after watching his grandmother and her elderly neighbors struggle to get by on their monthly benefits.",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "The new law came in just under the wire, with Mr. Biden signing it only weeks before the end of his presidency and after the Senate on December 21\u00a0voted 76-20\u00a0to pass the measure in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been decades in the making, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees.",
      "International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "\"Today, that promise has been restored, and retired fire fighters and emergency medical workers will now receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned and paid into,\" Kelly said.",
      "How much more in benefits?",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "\"The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned,\" Mr. Biden said after signing the bill into law.",
      "That said, the new law does not address the \"tremendous financial impact on the trust funds and the challenging [Social Security Administration] implementation procedures that will be required,\" said Martha Shedden, president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts.",
      "In an update Monday, the Social Security Administration said it is evaluating how to implement the act. Beneficiaries don't need to take any action to receive the enhanced payments other than verifying that the agency has their current mailing address and direct deposit information. Most people can do that online with their \"my Social Security account\" without having to call or visiting SSA, according to the agency.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 11:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis within three years, a report found.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Adams was researching health insurance options in 2023, he had one very specific requirement: coverage for prosthetic limbs.",
      "Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "Coverage disparity among plans",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity.\u00a0In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "An estimated\u00a02.3 million\u00a0people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as\u00a0double\u00a0in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "\"Insurance fairness\" laws",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about\u00a0half\u00a0of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years.",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric\u00a0hand\u00a0she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said."

      "Update: President Biden is now expected to sign the Social Security Fairness Act at 4 p.m. on Sunday, January 5.",
      "President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "Benton said she was told by a congressional staffer that Mr. Biden would sign the bill into law on Monday.",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an\u00a0update\u00a0Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\"",

In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",

      "Aviation data provider Cirium said in a\u00a0report\u00a0released Thursday that nearly 87% of Aeromexico flights arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival, a widely used measure of on-time performance among airlines.",
      "Saudia, the flagship carrier of Saudi Arabia, ranked second worldwide, with an on-time performance rate of just over 86%, according to Cirium.",
      "Cirium has rated airlines for timeliness for 16 years. This year's ranking is bases on data from more than 600 sources of real-time flight information, according to the report. To qualify for the on-time ranking, airlines must provide 80% actual gate arrival time data coverage.",
      "CEO Jeremy Bowen said 2024 was a difficult year for airlines due to severe weather patterns and the summer technology outage. The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said.",
      "Atlanta-based\u00a0Delta\u00a0achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide. The next-best U.S. carriers were\u00a0United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "\"Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in announcing the fine. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK - Disgraced former Rep. George Santos is seeking a delay to his February sentencing so that he can keep making new episodes of his podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos.\"",
      "Back in August, Santos, 36, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He owes the government $578,752.92 as per his plea deal. That includes $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.",
      "In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos' attorneys say their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced. They say that, through his podcast, Santos \"now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds.\"",

      "Delay \"would send a message that crime pays,\" prosecutors say",
      "Prosecutors responded to the request for a delay in sentencing by saying his claims of needing more time for the podcast to get off the ground \"are facially speculative, and, in any event, entirely insufficient to warrant such a lengthy adjournment.\"",
      "\"His request should for delay should be denied, and sentencing should proceed as scheduled,\" they wrote. \"A delay to allow Santos to develop his podcast \u2014 the title of which is a tone-deaf and unrepentant reference to the crimes he committed \u2014 is presumptively unreasonable.\"",
      "Prosecutors went on to say that Santos has already earned more than $400,000 from Cameo appearances and $400,000 for participating in a documentary. All of this is in addition to his $174,000 salary as a congressman. They took issue with a claim he made that he had less than $1,000 in liquid assets.",
      "\"Allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message that crime pays,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Delaying sentencing to give him further time to grow his podcast listenership would enable Santos to further use his criminal prosecution for personal benefit.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to intervene in his \"hush money\" case in New York ahead of his scheduled sentencing Friday.",
      "In a\u00a0request for emergency relief filed with the Supreme Court, the president-elect asked the justices to temporarily block further criminal proceedings in New York state court, including his upcoming sentencing, before he takes office. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records last summer and is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday at 9:30 a.m.",
      "Trump's bid comes after a New York appeals court on Tuesday rejected his latest effort to postpone his sentencing. His lawyers have argued that a president's immunity from criminal proceedings extends to the transition period \u2014 the time between the election and inauguration. In addition to asking the Supreme Court to enter a stay, Trump's lawyers said they have simultaneously asked the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to block the proceedings. A spokesperson for the state high court said \"it has received no filings about Trump's sentencing from his legal team so far.\"",
      "In their submission to the Supreme Court, Trump's lawyers argued that the justices should step in and pause his sentencing \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\" During the transition, they wrote, the president-elect is engaging in the \"extraordinarily demanding task of preparing to assume the executive power of the United States.\"",
      "The president-elect's effort to toss out the jury verdict \"will ultimately result in the dismissal of the District Attorney's politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning, centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar former attorney, violated President Trump's due process rights, and had no merit,\" predicted lawyer D. John Sauer, who Trump selected to serve as solicitor general in his next term.",
      "A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office \"will respond in court papers.\"",
      "Trump became the first former president to be convicted of crimes when a jury found him guilty of 34 state felony counts in late May and concluded he authorized a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election.",
      "The investigation that led to the New York charges against Trump began in 2018 and has already produced a landmark Supreme Court decision. The court ruled in July 2020 that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records as part of its criminal probe. Trump continued to fight against their release until after his first presidency in 2021, but the Supreme Court rejected his subsequent efforts to shield the financial records from prosecutors.",
      "He was set to be sentenced July 11, but the proceedings were postponed after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision finding former presidents cannot be federally prosecuted for official actions taken while in office. The ruling stemmed from a different case involving Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which arose out of his alleged efforts to stay in power after the 2020 election. Charges in that case have since been dropped, as Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing was then set for Sept. 18, but was pushed back again to avoid interfering with the presidential campaign. After Trump was elected to a second term in early November, a Nov. 26 hearing was then delayed as the president-elect and Manhattan prosecutors argued over how to proceed with the case.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan then issued an order last week setting Trump's sentencing for Jan. 10, just 10 days before his inauguration. The New York judge said he does not intend to sentence the president-elect to incarceration and is allowing him to appear virtually instead of in person.",
      "But Trump's lawyers have said that the sentencing is set to take place as he is preparing to return to the White House and would compromise his ability to conduct an orderly transition. During this time, Sauer wrote, the president-elect is communicating with world leaders, setting his domestic and foreign policy agenda and coordinating with the outgoing Biden administration across federal agencies.",
      "\"Forcing President Trump to prepare for a criminal sentencing in a felony case while he is preparing to lead the free world as president of the United States in less than two weeks imposes an intolerable, unconstitutional burden on him that undermines these vital national interests,\" Trump's legal team wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court in Atlanta on Wednesday to clear the way for the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In court documents filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the government wrote that Attorney General Merrick Garland has determined not to release the volume of Smith's report that deals with the classified documents case, so long as criminal proceedings involving co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira are pending.",
      "Garland does, however, plan to submit to Congress and the public the first volume of Smith's report, which relates to his investigation and prosecution of Trump stemming from the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Because the Attorney General has determined not to release to the public Volume Two of the Final Report to the public while defendants' case remains pending\u2014the volume that concerns the proceedings against defendants\u2014an injunction is unnecessary,\" prosecutors wrote, urging the 11th Circuit to deny the emergency request for an injunction.",
      "They noted that Smith sent his report to Garland on Tuesday and wrote in a cover letter to the attorney general that the portion involving Nauta and de Oliveira should not be released to the public while their cases are pending.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said a redacted version of the second volume of the report \u2014 involving the alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 would be made available for review only by the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees at their request, and if they agree not to release the information publicly.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The filing responded to an effort by Trump's former co-defendants, aide Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee de Oliveria, to stop the report's release. They argued their cases would be prejudiced by the release of the special counsel's report as the appeals of their cases continue.",
      "Defense attorneys earlier this week simultaneously asked the appeals court and Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw and dismissed the Trump classified documents case, to block Smith and Garland from publicly releasing a summary of the special counsel's findings. Cannon issued an order on Tuesday, temporarily enjoining the Justice Department\u00a0from publishing the report until the 11th Circuit decides the matter.",
      "The ongoing litigation is part of a bid by Trump and his allies to prevent federal prosecutors from releasing the contents of Smith's report. Smith revealed he has prepared a two-volume report to present to the attorney general, which prosecutors said was submitted Tuesday evening. Garland has pledged to release to the public all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and has so far stood by that promise, including after an investigation related to President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The special counsel and his office withdrew from the case after the 11th Circuit agreed to dismiss the appeal as it pertains to Trump following his election to a second term in November. It is now being overseen by the U.S. attorney in South Florida and other Justice Department lawyers.",
      "Still, Trump's attorneys urged Garland to remove Smith from his position and put a stop to the report's release, according to a letter included in court documents on Monday.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "But prosecutors told the 11th Circuit in their filing that the president-elect has not made any requests to the appeals court and \"would have no basis to seek to block the public release of Volume One of the final report,\" which deals with the investigation and prosecution arising from the alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump was charged alongside Nauta and de Oliveira in an alleged scheme to obstruct the federal probe. Both men pleaded not guilty.",
      "Smith ultimately dropped his bids to prosecute Trump, citing Justice Department rules that forbid the prosecution of a sitting president.

    "story": [
      "Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from getting mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding whether to issue a loan.",
      "The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be \"lifechanging\" for millions of families, \"making it easier for them to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan. ... Our historic rule will help more Americans save money, build wealth, and thrive.\"",
      "\"No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,\" she said.",
      "But, the Reuters news agency points out, Tuesday's announcement came despite demands from Republicans in Congress that the Biden administration stop issuing new rules with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office. That means he or his congressional allies may try to reverse the ban.",
      "\"Though Team Trump is likely to try to freeze or reverse these actions, it is not guaranteed,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report. \"Trump 2.0 is more populist than in 2017, which is why undoing a ban on including medical debt on credit reports or dropping an enforcement action against a credit bureau may not be a priority.\"",
      "Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.",
      "The administration announced plans for the rule in fall 2023.",
      "The CFPB said medical debt is a poor predictor of an individual's ability to repay a loan. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said last year that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"Medical debt burdens millions of families across the country and can unfairly tarnish a person's credit record, making it more difficult to qualify for an affordable loan, get a job, or even rent an apartment,\" Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for Consumer Reports, said in a statement. \"Many consumers have medical debt on their credit reports that is inaccurate or under dispute because our medical billing and insurance reimbursement system is so complex and confusing.\"",

      "The Justice Department filed its motion in the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday, asking the court to prohibit the war tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from moving forward with the plea agreements negotiated last summer. Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including a plea hearing for the attacks' alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed set for Friday \u2014 while the request is considered.",
      "\"The allegations against the respondents set forth their extensive roles as the counselors, commanders, and conspirators in the murder of 2,976 people, the injury of numerous civilians and military personnel, and the destruction of property worth tens of billions of dollars,\" the filing said, arguing later that \"this Court should issue a writ of mandamus and prohibition to the military commission directing it to recognize that the Secretary validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements with the respondents and prohibiting the military commission from conducting hearings in which the respondents would enter guilty pleas pursuant to the invalid pretrial agreements.\"",
      "Last summer, Mohammed, and two other defendants reached deals that would have enabled them to plead guilty to their alleged roles in the 9/11 attacks in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to revoke the deals, saying in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the authority to approve the plea deals instead of a subordinate authority, who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Following the decision by the military appeals court, the Defense Department said it was considering its options and whether to go to a higher court, as it now has.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government will issue refunds to tens of thousands of unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens who applied for a Biden administration program that was struck down in federal court, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, plans to refund the $580 application fee that roughly 94,000 people paid in hopes of benefiting from the Biden administration policy, dubbed Keeping Families Together. The refunds amount to about $55 million, the documents show.",
      "Announced in June by President Biden, the initiative offered an estimated half a million unauthorized immigrants a chance to get temporary legal status and a streamlined path to permanent residency, if they were married to U.S. citizens and had lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes. But a federal judge halted the policy almost immediately after it took effect in late August, agreeing with Republican-led states that argued the program flouted U.S. immigration law.",
      "Even if the initiative had survived the legal challenge mounted by Republican state officials, it still would've been in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised to reverse Biden administration immigration policies and oversee mass deportations.",
      "The Keeping Families Together policy was designed to help some longstanding unauthorized immigrants, a population progressive activists argued had been ignored amid the Biden administration's focus on handling the record numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.",
      "While marrying a U.S. citizen generally leads to a green card, American immigration law requires those who entered the country illegally to leave and reenter legally to qualify for permanent residency. Undocumented immigrants, however, can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years upon leaving if they have lived in the country unlawfully for a certain period of time.",
      "The program would have allowed eligible applicants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country, by granting them an immigration classification known as parole that effectively cancels out an illegal entry and provides temporary work permits.",
      "In addition to the spouses of American citizens, the program would have also benefited an estimated 50,000 undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens.",
      "Reached for comment, USCIS confirmed it would close pending applications and issue refunds to applicants.",
      "\"The court order vacating the [Keeping Families Together] process has resulted in requestors paying a fee for an immigration benefit request that, through no fault of their own, cannot be considered,\" the agency said in a statement, noting it determined the refunds were \"in the public interest and consistent with applicable law.\"",

A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",

    "story": [
      "The federal judge overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's now-dismissed case related to classified documents in Florida has temporarily blocked the Justice Department from releasing special counsel Jack Smith's report. Read the latest here.",
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released Monday.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\" The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump attorneys filed a brief in Florida arguing that the special counsel should be ordered not to transmit his report on the documents case to Garland while Trump's emergency motion is pending, and also that Garland should be ordered\u00a0 \"not to issue any aspect of Smith's missive to the public.\"",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith, a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the run-up to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was reelected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe, the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise, including after a separate special counsel, Robert Hur, submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report, which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings \u2014 including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age \u2014 were publicly released.",
      "Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission, the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done, the sources said.",
      "In Monday's letter, Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections, arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests.",
      "Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration, as the letter suggested, much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department, and his selection for attorney general, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "The letter to the attorney general was included as an exhibit in a simultaneous effort by Trump's former codefendants in the classified documents case to ask a court to intervene and stop the release of the special counsel's report.",
      "Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report, arguing they would \"suffer harm as civilian casualties\" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations.",
      "While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy, he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed.",
      "On Monday, attorneys for the men turned to Cannon, urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights.",
      "\"The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The filing of such a report, by an unauthorized person, is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings, now on appeal, at counsel Smith's own insistence.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.",
      "The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel, Jay Bratt, retired from the Justice Department. Bratt, a 34-year federal prosecutor and former head of the Justice Department's counterintelligence section, played a key role in the origins of the classified documents probe and went on to prosecute the case against Trump as part of Smith's team.",
      "While no date has been publicly announced for the release of Smith's report, the defense attorneys asked Cannon to issue a ruling by Friday.",
      "In response to the court filing, the special counsel said that while his team is \"working to finalize\" a two-volume report to hand in to Garland, the attorney general will commit to not releasing it to the public until at least Friday at 10 a.m. to give the court time to rule.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 13:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report by a powerful Senate committee.",
    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Healthcare, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges, which have since been dismissed.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sebastian Gorka failed security screenings during Trump's first term, but could return as White House counterterrorism chief.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be the counterterrorism chief on the White House National Security Council, Sebastian Gorka, is raising concerns among security experts because of his inability to obtain a security clearance early in Trump's first term.",
      "Gorka was forced to depart after seven months, in August 2017, as a lower-level White House staffer after officials were informed that he would not pass his background investigation, sources have confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It is unclear whether the past concerns that led to the denial of his security clearance will impede him from obtaining this new, higher-level post. The job of deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism does not require Senate confirmation, but neither did his position in the first Trump administration.",
      "A Trump transition source told CBS News that Gorka currently \"has an active security clearance with the U.S. government.\" But the transition did not respond to requests to clarify whether the Gorka had been given the customary temporary clearance appointees receive as they are preparing to assume their government position and before they go through the more rigorous FBI background investigation.",
      "Trump has the ultimate authority over who serves on his national security team in the White House, and he can bypass recommendations about clearances. Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump transition, defended Gorka's credentials and told CBS News\u00a0 that \"Dr. Gorka has decades of experience working on matters of national security, irregular warfare, and counterterrorism.\"",
      "Gorka \"will bring a wealth of knowledge and boldness to the National Security Council that will help make America safe again,\" Hughes said.",
      "But some former law enforcement and intelligence officials told CBS News they believe Gorka's past security roadblocks should also be a red flag this time around.",
      "\"Typically when someone has been disqualified at some point, unless there is a grace period to allow them to [enter] the process again to see if the issue can me mitigated, they should not be afforded a position of trust in the government,\" said Stephen Laycock, who served as executive assistant director for the FBI's intelligence branch until 2021.",
      "John Bolton, who was Trump's third national security adviser during his first term and is now a staunch critic of the former president, has said that Gorka should be subjected to a \"full FBI field background investigation\" before assuming the NSC position.",
      "Gorka has been named as Trump's pick for one of the most important jobs in the counterterrorism firmament \u2013 one that would put him at the center of life-and-death decisions involving elite U.S. forces. The role requires access to some of the most sensitive, compartmentalized intelligence in the U.S. government.",
      "In 2017, Trump had named Gorka, a longtime acolyte and Steve Bannon prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to a nebulously defined unit of the National Security Council called the Strategic Initiative Group, a kind of West Wing think tank. John Kelly, Trump's second chief of staff, was perplexed by Gorka's role, three sources who worked in the White House said. At the time, the retired four-star Marine general was focused on imposing discipline on a chaotic White House.",
      "\"He saw people like (Steve) Bannon and Gorka running around the White House with an open loop to the president,\" said one former White House official. When Kelly learned Gorka had been unable to obtain a high-level security clearance for the job, he dismissed Gorka, sources told CBS News.",
      "Why Gorka failed his security screening at that time has not been disclosed, although the review came soon after he was caught by TSA at a security checkpoint carrying a gun into Ronald Reagan National airport. Gorka faced a misdemeanor weapons charge, which was eventually dismissed.\u00a0 Gorka, British-born to Hungarian parents, also was denied clearances to serve on a panel in 2002 that was investigating the then-Hungarian prime minister's past as a member of the Soviet-era Communist secret police, Buzzfeed News reported in 2017.",
      "A firebrand and MAGA crusader, he endeared himself to Trump as a White House aide during his first term with his frequent cable TV appearances defending the administration's most controversial \"America First\" policies, including the so-called \"Muslim ban.\"",
      "He drew scrutiny for controversial remarks about the Judeo-Christian West being in a civilizational struggle against Islam and for his alleged ties to right-wing Hungarian nationalists. He has also faced questions about his academic credentials (Gorka earned a Ph.D from a relatively obscure Hungarian university and served as an administrative dean at the National Defense University.)",
      "Last month, Gorka was a featured speaker at a MAGA Turning Point USA gathering in Arizona, where he stoked conspiracy theories about last summer's assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"The most charitable thing you can say about it,\" Gorka said ominously, is that \"it was failure by design, failure by design, but we will get to the bottom of it.\"",
      "As NSC counterterrorism chief, at any given moment, Gorka could be interacting with the president, Pentagon officials or the CIA to help coordinate lethal strikes against suspected terrorists or risky hostage rescues, for instance.\u00a0 It would also be within his purview to steer policies that require the support of diplomatic partners.",
      "One former Trump counterterrorism official recalled that during Trump's first term, Gorka was involved in efforts to designate Mexico's drug cartels as a foreign terrorist organization, and he said he expects that Gorka could try to revive that policy push. That redesignation would give the U.S. a stronger legal basis for conducting military operations in Mexico. It was scuttled during the last term over fierce opposition from the State Department.",
      "Some Trump critics told CBS News they are concerned that Gorka's return could signal a less disciplined approach to managing the White House \u2013 in which an array of advisers with competing interests could gain unfettered access to the Oval Office \u2014 recreating some of the pitfalls of Trump's first administration.",
      "\"For Trump, process is anathema and discipline is foreign,\" said Chris Whipple, an author, former \"60 Minutes\" producer and documentary filmmaker whose book, \"The Gatekeepers,\" is a behind-the-scenes study of White House chiefs of staff from Reagan to Trump. \"The only qualification that matters is abject loyalty, period,\" Whipple said. \"And that's why you have people like \u2026 Seb Gorka running around the Oval Office.\"",

      "NEW YORK - A federal judge in New York City on Monday said that Rudy Giuliani was in contempt of court for failing to properly respond to requests for information as he turned over assets to satisfy a $148 million defamation judgment granted to two Georgia election workers.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled after hearing Giuliani testify for a second day at a contempt hearing called after lawyers for the election workers said the former New York City mayor had failed to properly comply with evidence production requests over the last few months.",
      "On Friday, Giuliani testified for about three hours in Liman's Manhattan courtroom, but the judge permitted him to finish testifying remotely on Monday from his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "At the start of the hearing Monday, Giuliani had an American flag backdrop, which he said he uses for a program he conducts over the internet, but the judge told him to change it to a plain background.",
      "Giuliani conceded during Monday's testimony that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested because he believed the requests were overly broad or inappropriate or even a \"trap\" set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "He also said he sometimes had trouble turning over information regarding his assets because of numerous criminal and civil court cases requiring him to produce factual information.",
      "Giuliani, 80, said the demands to turn over materials made it \"impossible to function in an official way\" about 30% to 40% of the time.",

    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",

      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",

      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",

      "The blazes grew out of an explosive brush fire that spread across northwestern Los Angeles early Tuesday, fueled by powerful winds that tore through the region. At least 30,000 residents were forced to evacuate their homes in the Pacific Palisades, a coastal neighborhood between Santa Monica in western L.A. County and Malibu, because of the Palisades Fire, which was initially reported at 10:30 a.m. PT that morning.",
      "It had grown to at least 2,921 acres by Wednesday, with zero containment, Cal Fire said. The Los Angeles County Fire Department estimated that the Palisades Fire threatened more than 10,300 homes, and the number of structures already damaged or destroyed was still unclear.",
      "L.A. fire officials said they received reports of multiple burn victims within 24 hours of the blaze taking shape, and warned more people were at risk.

Currently the largest wildfire in Southern California, the Palisades Fire grew out of a brush fire that exploded as powerful winds ripped through the area. It expanded rapidly and exponentially on Wednesday.",
      "Firefighters are also battling the Eaton Fire, which trails the Palisades Fire closely in size and has consumed at least 10,600 acres in northern Los Angeles County. Like the Palisades Fire, it expanded dramatically Wednesday. They are fighting the smaller, newer Hurst and Woodley Fires, too.",
      "Where are the Los Angeles fire evacuation zones?",
      "At least 70,000 residents of Los Angeles County have been ordered to evacuate as of Wednesday morning, officials said, with the Palisades Fire alone urging 30,000 of those evacuations. Altogether, the fires threaten at least 28,000 structures in different sections of the county, and Los Angeles Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said that 1,000 have already been destroyed in the Palisades area.",

      "Another blaze, the Woodley Fire, broke out Wednesday morning near a Los Angeles nature reserve. That fire has not prompted evacuations, although Cal Fire warned that strong winds were pushing it southward.",
      "No part of any of these four major wildfires has been contained, according to Cal Fire. The agency is continuing to update comprehensive lists of evacuation zones in the incident reports for each active wildfire on its website.",
      "Where did the Los Angeles fires start?",
      "The Palisades Fire initially erupted Tuesday morning near the Pacific Palisades, an upscale and partly coastal residential area in northwestern Los Angeles. It began as a brush fire that spiraled out of control because of ongoing wind in the region.",
      "Sheila Kelliher, a Los Angeles County Fire Department captain, told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that fighting the wildfires is \"incredibly challenging and volatile and unpredictable,\" calling the winds \"ferocious\" while imploring people in evacuation zones to heed officials' instructions and \"get out when those warnings come.\"",
      "\"Pack up, get ready to go,\" Kelliher said. Referencing the pedestrians who abandoned their cars on roadways blocked by traffic when evacuations got underway, she added: \"Sometimes, as you can see, the cars had to be left behind and a lot of times just even getting out on foot, you've got to get going.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's lawyers argued that the justices should step in and pause his sentencing \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to intervene in his \"hush money\" case in New York ahead of his scheduled sentencing Friday.",
      "In a\u00a0request for emergency relief filed with the Supreme Court, the president-elect asked the justices to temporarily block further criminal proceedings in New York state court, including his upcoming sentencing, before he takes office. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records last summer and is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday at 9:30 a.m.",
      "Trump's bid comes after a New York appeals court on Tuesday rejected his latest effort to postpone his sentencing. His lawyers have argued that a president's immunity from criminal proceedings extends to the transition period \u2014 the time between the election and inauguration. In addition to asking the Supreme Court to enter a stay, Trump's lawyers said they have simultaneously asked the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to block the proceedings. A spokesperson for the state high court said \"it has received no filings about Trump's sentencing from his legal team so far.\"",
      "In their submission to the Supreme Court, Trump's lawyers argued that the justices should step in and pause his sentencing \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\" During the transition, they wrote, the president-elect is engaging in the \"extraordinarily demanding task of preparing to assume the executive power of the United States.\"",
      "The president-elect's effort to toss out the jury verdict \"will ultimately result in the dismissal of the District Attorney's politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning, centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar former attorney, violated President Trump's due process rights, and had no merit,\" predicted lawyer D. John Sauer, who Trump selected to serve as solicitor general in his next term.",
      "A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office \"will respond in court papers.\"",
      "Trump became the first former president to be convicted of crimes when a jury found him guilty of 34 state felony counts in late May and concluded he authorized a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election.",
      "The investigation that led to the New York charges against Trump began in 2018 and has already produced a landmark Supreme Court decision. The court ruled in July 2020 that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records as part of its criminal probe. Trump continued to fight against their release until after his first presidency in 2021, but the Supreme Court rejected his subsequent efforts to shield the financial records from prosecutors.",
      "He was set to be sentenced July 11, but the proceedings were postponed after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision finding former presidents cannot be federally prosecuted for official actions taken while in office. The ruling stemmed from a different case involving Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which arose out of his alleged efforts to stay in power after the 2020 election. Charges in that case have since been dropped, as Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing was then set for Sept. 18, but was pushed back again to avoid interfering with the presidential campaign. After Trump was elected to a second term in early November, a Nov. 26 hearing was then delayed as the president-elect and Manhattan prosecutors argued over how to proceed with the case.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan then issued an order last week setting Trump's sentencing for Jan. 10, just 10 days before his inauguration. The New York judge said he does not intend to sentence the president-elect to incarceration and is allowing him to appear virtually instead of in person.",
      "But Trump's lawyers have said that the sentencing is set to take place as he is preparing to return to the White House and would compromise his ability to conduct an orderly transition. During this time, Sauer wrote, the president-elect is communicating with world leaders, setting his domestic and foreign policy agenda and coordinating with the outgoing Biden administration across federal agencies.",
      "\"Forcing President Trump to prepare for a criminal sentencing in a felony case while he is preparing to lead the free world as president of the United States in less than two weeks imposes an intolerable, unconstitutional burden on him that undermines these vital national interests,\" Trump's legal team wrote.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who oversees requests for emergency relief arising from the 2nd Circuit, has ordered Manhattan prosecutors to respond to Trump's bid by Thursday at 10 a.m.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department told a federal appeals court that the portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation involving the 2020 election should be released to the public.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court in Atlanta on Wednesday to clear the way for the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In court documents filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the government wrote that Attorney General Merrick Garland has determined not to release the volume of Smith's report that deals with the classified documents case, so long as criminal proceedings involving co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira are pending.",
      "Garland does, however, plan to submit to Congress and the public the first volume of Smith's report, which relates to his investigation and prosecution of Trump stemming from the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Because the Attorney General has determined not to release to the public Volume Two of the Final Report to the public while defendants' case remains pending\u2014the volume that concerns the proceedings against defendants\u2014an injunction is unnecessary,\" prosecutors wrote, urging the 11th Circuit to deny the emergency request for an injunction.",
      "They noted that Smith sent his report to Garland on Tuesday and wrote in a cover letter to the attorney general that the portion involving Nauta and de Oliveira should not be released to the public while their cases are pending.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said a redacted version of the second volume of the report \u2014 involving the alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 would be made available for review only by the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees at their request, and if they agree not to release the information publicly.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The filing responded to an effort by Trump's former co-defendants, aide Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee de Oliveria, to stop the report's release. They argued their cases would be prejudiced by the release of the special counsel's report as the appeals of their cases continue.",
      "Defense attorneys earlier this week simultaneously asked the appeals court and Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw and dismissed the Trump classified documents case, to block Smith and Garland from publicly releasing a summary of the special counsel's findings. Cannon issued an order on Tuesday, temporarily enjoining the Justice Department\u00a0from publishing the report until the 11th Circuit decides the matter.",
      "The ongoing litigation is part of a bid by Trump and his allies to prevent federal prosecutors from releasing the contents of Smith's report. Smith revealed he has prepared a two-volume report to present to the attorney general, which prosecutors said was submitted Tuesday evening. Garland has pledged to release to the public all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and has so far stood by that promise, including after an investigation related to President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The special counsel and his office withdrew from the case after the 11th Circuit agreed to dismiss the appeal as it pertains to Trump following his election to a second term in November. It is now being overseen by the U.S. attorney in South Florida and other Justice Department lawyers.",
      "Still, Trump's attorneys urged Garland to remove Smith from his position and put a stop to the report's release, according to a letter included in court documents on Monday.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "But prosecutors told the 11th Circuit in their filing that the president-elect has not made any requests to the appeals court and \"would have no basis to seek to block the public release of Volume One of the final report,\" which deals with the investigation and prosecution arising from the alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump was charged alongside Nauta and de Oliveira in an alleged scheme to obstruct the federal probe. Both men pleaded not guilty.",
      "Smith ultimately dropped his bids to prosecute Trump, citing Justice Department rules that forbid the prosecution of a sitting president. But he opted to continue with an appeal of Cannon's decision to dismiss the case against Nauta and de Oliveira to overturn the finding that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.",
      "The defendants, as a result, sought to stop the release as the case proceeded.",
      "During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump slammed Smith as a \"bad guy\" and complimented Cannon, whom he appointed to the federal bench during his first term, as a \"brilliant judge.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:12:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

Matthew Livelsberger looked into the amount of explosives he'd need, where to buy fireworks and how to buy a phone without providing identifying information, Kevin McMahill, sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said during a press conference. McMahill called the use of the generative AI a \"game changer.\"",
      "\"We knew that AI was going to change the game at some point or another in really all of our lives,\" McMahill said. \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device.\"",

In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said. \"We're working with law enforcement to support their investigation.\"",
      "Las Vegas law enforcement officials and an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shared other new details during Tuesday's press conference, including new information on what caused the explosion. Police shared video of Livelsberger pouring racing fuel onto the Cybertruck.",
      "\"You'll see a trail of liquid falling from the back of the vehicle,\" Las Vegas Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said.",
      "Officials are still working to determine what exactly detonated the explosion, but said it could have been the muzzle flash from the firearm Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself.",
      "Koren said a review of a note on Livelsberger's phone showed that Livelsberger believed people were following him. The note, titled \"surveillance\" or \"surveil,\" was more of a journal of activities. It included details on Livelsberger's activities leading up to the bombing, including his purchase of guns and picking up the Cybertruck as a rental.",
      "The log showed Livelsberger had considered carrying out his plot in Arizona at the Grand Canyon's glass skywalk. Koren said investigators don't know when or why Livelsberger changed his plans.",
      "Las Vegas police also said they'd uncovered a six-page document they were reviewing with assistance from the Pentagon. Some of the material in the document may be classified, officials said.",
      "McMahill said investigators also still need to recover information from a laptop, a mobile phone and a smartwatch.",
      "Last week, the FBI said that investigators had determined the bombing was likely a suicide. The FBI said that information uncovered by federal investigators and the Army found that Livelsberger likely had post-traumatic stress disorder, along with family issues and personal grievances that may have contributed to his actions. An Army spokesperson confirmed to CBS News in a statement that Livelsberger had received counseling through its Preservation of the Force and Family program.",
      "Livelsberger did not have a criminal history. He was not on the radar of the FBI or the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department before the explosion, McMahill said. Officials previously said Livelsberger had no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, during a long news conference on Tuesday, spoke about his interest in securing U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, and said he would not rule out the use of military force.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and why Trump might want the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why would Trump want to control it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic.",
      "It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security purposes,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world. You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Trump could be trying to take advantage that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Those deposits are likely to draw the interest of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's become a close adviser to Trump after providing more than $270 million last year to back his and other Republicans' candidacies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why would Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Trump said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" Trump said.",
      "Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed Trump's claims.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "Panama's Foreign Minister Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha said Tuesday that his government hadn't spoken formally with Trump or his team about the canal recently, but he reiterated previous comments from the country's president that the canal would remain under Panamanian control.",

In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 as well as chemical precursors. Officials said last month that the seizure of over a ton of fentanyl pills was the biggest in the country's history.",

      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 An Italian journalist detained in Iran for three weeks and whose fate became intertwined with that of an Iranian engineer wanted by the United States was freed Wednesday and is heading home, Italian officials announced.",
      "A plane carrying Cecilia Sala took off from Tehran after \"intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels,\" Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said, adding that Meloni had informed Sala's parents of the news.",
      "Iranian media acknowledged the journalist's release, citing only the foreign reports. Iranian officials offered no immediate comment.",
      "Sala, a 29-year-old reporter for the Il Foglio daily, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, three days after she arrived on a journalist visa. She was accused of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, the official IRNA news agency said, but no details of her purported transgressions were ever provided by Iranian officials.",
      "Word of Sala's release was met with cheers in Italy, where her plight had dominated headlines, as lawmakers hailed the successful negotiations to bring her home.",
      "It came after Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida last weekend to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Meloni tweeted Sala's return in a statement on X in which she thanked \"all those who helped make Cecilia's return possible, allowing her to reembrace her family and colleagues.\"",
      "Italian commentators had speculated that Iran was holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure the release of Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport three days before on Dec. 16, on a U.S. warrant. Iranian analysts who spoke with CBS News on the condition they remain anonymous said the same thing.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department accused Abedini and another Iranian of supplying drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. He remains in detention in Italy.",

The saga was particularly complicated for Italy, which is an historic ally of Washington, but traditionally maintains good relations with Tehran.",

      "This could be done through so-called \"conditional expression\" techniques, which use chemicals or other biological triggers to turn specific genes on or off at will.",
      "This would allow venomous males to successfully mate with females in lab conditions, producing enough viable offspring for the technique to be scaled up.",
      "Genetic engineering has been used for years to control populations of disease-spreading mosquitoes.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government has determined that Sudan's RSF paramilitary force and its allies have committed genocide in the country's raging civil war.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has determined that genocide has been committed by members of the RSF paramilitary force and its allied militias in Sudan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday. The \"Rapid Support Forces\" and its allies are one side in a largely hidden but vicious civil war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in less than two years.",
      "In a statement announcing the U.S. determination that genocide was committed \u2014 and that new sanctions were being imposed as a result \u2014 Blinken called it a \"conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.\"",
      "Blinken announced sanctions against RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, as well as seven RSF-linked companies based in the United Arab Emirates and an individual accused of helping the RSF procure weapons. As part of the sanctions, Hemedti and his family were barred from entering the United States.",
      "The war has left \"638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan's recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead,\" Blinken said.",
      "\"The RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians. The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys \u2014 even infants \u2014 on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\" Blinken said. \"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "In May 2024, the Human Rights Watch organization said the RSF and its allies could have been guilty of genocide against non-Arab ethnic communities over a specific series of attacks in the western region of Darfur. The RSF has been widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes since the war broke out.",
      "The International Criminal Court has been investigating ethnic-based killings in Darfur and has said it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the paramilitaries and the Sudanese army have committed unspecified \"Rome Statute crimes,\" which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The ICC's investigation continues.",
      "Why is there a civil war in Sudan?",
      "Fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF in April 2023 after months of tension between the two top generals who had been running the country. The former allies in charge of the SAF and the RSF had been negotiating to fully integrate the RSF into the army before the formation of a new transitional government. Those negotiations broke down and the two sides went to war.",
      "After war broke out, the U.S. government, along with international partners, unsuccessfully tried to broker a peace agreement.",
      "Journalists and aid officials have largely been blocked from traveling to the country to report on the conflict first-hand, but independent researchers say the number of deaths from the war has been vastly unreported.",
      "According to a study published in November by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an estimated 61,000 people were killed in Khartoum State alone, home to the capital city of the same name, between April 2023 and June 2024.",
      "The study found that more than 90% of those deaths went unrecorded, but the estimated toll was considerably higher than previously believed.",
      "\"Our findings reveal the severe and largely invisible impact of the war on Sudanese lives, especially of preventable disease and starvation, said the report's lead author Dr. Maysoon Dahab, adding that \"the overwhelming level of killings\" in the central Kordofan and western Darfur regions \"indicate wars within a war.\"",
      "\"Today's action is part of our continued efforts to promote accountability for all warring parties whose actions fuel this conflict,\" Blinken said Tuesday. \"The United States does not support either side of this war.\"",
      "What is genocide?",
      "The United Nations adopted the\u00a0Genocide Convention\u00a0in 1948 after the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany. In it, genocide is defined as any one of a series of acts, \"committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\" Those acts include:",

    "story": [
      "The human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, is reportedly surging in China, raising questions about what the illness is and if it's a concern to those in the U.S.",
      "Officials in India have also confirmed cases of HMPV. Seven people there have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.",
      "Chinese health officials have not confirmed that HMPV is what is driving hospitalizations in the country, and recent reports from China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the increase may actually be due to influenza A. But with less public knowledge around HMPV in the U.S., worries of a potential new pandemic have risen \u2014 though experts say there isn't need for alarm.",
      "\"The concern for a pandemic can be put at rest,\"\u00a0Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno,\u00a0Children's Medical Center Plano director of infection prevention and control, told CBS News, adding not only is the virus fairly stable, it's also not a novel virus like COVID-19 was. \"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity against this human metapneumovirus.\"",
      "What is HMPV?",
      "HMPV is a virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus.",
      "The length of illness varies depending on the severity on an individual's case but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "HMPV symptoms",
      "According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include:",
      "CoughFeverNasal congestionShortness of breath",
      "Cough",
      "Fever",
      "Nasal congestion",
      "Shortness of breath",
      "\"Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections,\" the CDC's website notes.",
      "Is HMPV a new virus?",
      "HMPV is not new. It was first discovered in 2001 and is part of the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, according to the CDC.",
      "It may have been circulating even earlier \u2014 for decades or over a century, Garcia Carreno said.",
      "In the U.S., HMPV typically circulates beginning in the winter and lasts until or through spring, the CDC says, and can circulate simultaneously with RSV and the flu during the respiratory virus season.",
      "Is HMPV worse than COVID?",
      "Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern \u2014 it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week.",
      "For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.",
      "Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\"Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia,\" the clinic's website adds.",
      "HMPV transmission and prevention",
      "HMPV is transmitted through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, compared to flu, RSV and COVID, we don't have a vaccine for human metapneumovirus, so we don't have that advantage of priming over or boosting our immune system to fight these viruses,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"But still, everything else that we learned for COVID can apply to human metapneumovirus.\"",
      "To prevent illness, take similar steps to preventing other respiratory viruses, meaning wash hands with soap and water and avoid close contact with sick people.",
      "\"If somebody's sick, try to avoid crowding so they don't expose everybody, especially the vulnerable people,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"If that person is sick and can not avoid going to a place where other people are, then try to use a mask, use cough and sneezing etiquette and good hand washing.\"",

      "His daughter took the party's leadership in 2011 and booted him out four years later, seeking to distance her movement from his extremist reputation. RN showed strong gains in last year's European Parliament elections, and became the largest single party in a subsequent general election in France.",

      "The new French government formed in the wake of the summer elections \u2014 after considerable haggling \u2014 is center-right, and while it does not include any RN members, the far-right, anti-immigration movement founded by the senior Le Pen now holds enough seats in parliament to exert significant influence over the country's policies.",

    "summary": "North Korea says it carried out its second missile test in two days \u2014 and this one was hypersonic. It came as U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited the region.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.",
      "The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea's military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing.",
      "North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine.",
      "North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, Pyongyang has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability.",
      "North Korea since 2021 has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it's unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims.",
      "The North's state media said Kim supervised Monday's launch and that the weapon traveled 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 99.8 kilometers (62 miles) and 42.5 kilometers (26.4 miles) and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound before accurately striking a sea target.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating the capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak.",
      "Lee said the test was likely a followup to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile.",
      "Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North's nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal \"no one can respond to,\" according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "\"The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,\" the agency quoted Kim as saying.",
      "Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering \"different security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,\" but KCNA didn't mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo.",
      "The launches took place while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Tokyo and Seoul for talks with Japanese and South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues.",
      "In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea's launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North's weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a \"two-way street,\" saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and \"intends to share space and satellite technology.\"",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim's nuclear-armed military.",
      "At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the \"toughest\" anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a \"nuclear military bloc for aggression.\"",
      "North Korean state media didn't specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program.",
      "Even when Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position - built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions - presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.",

      "During the \"It Ends With Us\" press tour in August, Flaa uploaded a video interviewing Lively in 2016 titled, \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\" Flaa seemingly experienced an uncomfortable moment with Lively after she congratulated the \"Gossip Girl\" star on her pregnancy.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke with multiple mental health experts, who identified the most common signs and symptoms of ADHD in adults.",
      "1. Impulsive behaviors",
      "Adults with ADHD have difficulty managing impulsivity, according to Zo\u00eb Kahn, a licensed psychotherapist and ADHD therapist in Pasadena, California.",
      "\"This can look like blurting out answers in a classroom setting, interrupting in conversation and difficulty thinking through the long-term consequences of choices,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD AFFECTS 1 IN 9 KIDS IN US, NEW REPORT REVEALS: \u2018SHAME AND STIGMA\u2019",
      "Impulsivity can also lead to making snap decisions without considering long-term consequences, Anderson added.",
      "\"It might also manifest subtly, like overspending on impulse purchases or having trouble waiting your turn in group discussions,\" she said.",
      "2. Difficulty focusing or staying on task",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, Anderson noted.",
      "\"You might struggle to start tasks, even when vital, or abandon them halfway through,\" she said. \"You might jump between tasks without finishing anything or focus on smaller, less urgent tasks while the bigger, more critical ones remain untouched.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a persistent challenge that affects work, relationships and daily responsibilities.\"",
      "It's not about laziness, Anderson noted, but about feeling overwhelmed by what needs to be done.",

      "People with ADHD may struggle to manage their schedules, often underestimating how long it will take to complete a project or reach a destination.",
      "\"Deadlines might sneak up on you, or you might feel perpetually behind on tasks, no matter how early you started,\" Anderson told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS",

      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track,\" she said.",
      "\"ADHD-related daydreaming is persistent and often disruptive, especially when it happens during crucial tasks or conversations.\" (iStock)",

      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track.\"",
      "They may also find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys.",
      "\"Adults with ADHD have a hard time finding and keeping focus, which could look like not paying attention in conversation, missing key details, being easily distracted in certain settings, or even focusing on the wrong details,\" Kahn added.",
      "6. Inability to sit still",
      "People with ADHD often find themselves fidgeting and feeling generally restless, according to Dr. Michelle Dees, a board-certified psychiatrist at Luxury Psychiatry Clinic in Chicago.",
      "People with ADHD may find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys. (iStock)",
      "\"In adults, this may present as inner disquietude or incomplete calmness,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "Anderson reiterated this common symptom, noting that in children, it often takes the form of physical hyperactivity.",
      "DEPRESSION COULD BE PREVENTED WITH SPECIFIC DAILY STEP COUNT, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"It often transforms into internal restlessness in adults, where you feel like you can\u2019t fully relax or sit still without feeling jittery,\" she said. \"This constant sense of being \u2018on edge\u2019 can become exhausting over time.\"",
      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, which can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, according to Anderson. This can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.",
      "\"Many people with ADHD describe feeling like their emotions are more intense and more challenging to control than those of others around them,\" she added.",

      "If you\u2019ve experienced several of the above signs and they interfere with your daily life, experts recommend seeking help.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"ADHD is not a flaw nor something to be ashamed of \u2014 it\u2019s simply a different way of processing information and interacting with the world,\" said Anderson.",
      "The first step is to speak with a health care professional specializing in ADHD, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or even your primary care physician, she suggested.",
      "\"They can provide a proper evaluation and help you explore treatment options, including therapy, medication or lifestyle adjustments,\" Anderson noted.",
      "Potential solutions include mindfulness exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help people with ADHD to improve their organization, time management and emotion regulation, the same source stated.",

      "It is important to be assessed by a psychiatrist or mental health clinician if you experience multiple ADHD symptoms, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "\"ADHD has overlapping symptoms with other disorders and is often comorbid with other diagnoses,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",

      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",

      "What is business email compromise (BEC)?",
      "Business email compromise (BEC) is a form of cybercrime that targets companies engaged in wire transfer payments and other financial transactions. The FBI reports that BEC scams have caused billions in losses globally. These scams exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, making them particularly insidious.",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How the scam works",
      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Real-life implications",
      "The consequences of BEC scams can be devastating for businesses. In addition to direct financial losses, companies may face reputational damage, loss of customer trust and potential legal ramifications. For small businesses like Teresa's, which may not have extensive cybersecurity measures in place, the impact can be particularly severe.",
      "Illustration of security on a computer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The story shared by Teresa W. serves as a crucial reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital communications. The rise of BEC scams not only threatens financial security but also erodes trust in electronic transactions. By implementing robust security measures and maintaining vigilance at all levels of an organization, individuals and businesses can protect themselves from these insidious attacks.",

It charges your devices while you're chilling outdoors. What makes it special? Perovskite solar cells that are seriously impressive. These cells are about 30% more powerful than traditional solar cells in bright sunlight and perform twice as well in low light. The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler. So you could literally keep your drinks cold and your phone charged at the same time. While they haven't announced the price yet, you can expect to see this tech to hit stores sometime in spring or summer.",

Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

That\u2019s why the makers of iPhones and Android devices have multiple ways you can restore contacts on your phone. Following these easy steps outlined above gives you the ability to rectify that situation quickly. It is best to make sure that your mobile devices are being backed up either to the cloud or physically to a computer or hard drive backup so that there is a source from which to restore your contacts. Additionally, should anything go awry when you're doing the restoration process, you have the ability to recover lost data. Accidents happen, but practicing safe data hygiene prevents them from becoming a lost cause or needing a miracle.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",

These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

      "Before you toggle this off, let\u2019s take a moment to understand why you might want it on and what happens when you turn it off.",
      "Imagine this: You\u2019re meeting a friend in a busy city, and instead of sending a dozen texts back and forth, they can simply see your real-time location on Google Maps.

It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",

In May 2024, law enforcement shut down a botnet, a network of hijacked devices, called 911 S5. Several free VPN services, including MaskVPN, DewVPN, PaladinVPN, ProxyGate, ShieldVPN and ShineVPN, were used to create this botnet.",

      "Here are seven essential steps to help you choose a reliable VPN and safeguard your online privacy.",
      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

      "Ingenuity's legacy",
      "Ingenuity's journey on Mars far exceeded expectations. Originally designed for just five test flights over 30 days, it ultimately completed an astounding 72 flights in nearly three years. The helicopter served as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover, helping scientists and engineers gather valuable data about Mars' terrain and atmosphere.",
      "Throughout its mission, Ingenuity pushed the boundaries of extraterrestrial flight, reaching a maximum altitude of\u00a078.7 feet, achieving a top speed of 22.4 mph and completing a single longest flight that covered 2,310 feet.",

      "NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is working on a concept for a next-generation Mars helicopter that could revolutionize exploration of the red planet. This new aircraft, still in the early stages of development, promises to be a significant upgrade from Ingenuity.",
      "The proposed helicopter features six rotors in a hexagonal configuration and is significantly larger, potentially \"the size of an SUV.\" It would have the ability to carry science payloads of up to 11 pounds and cover a range of up to 1.9 miles per Martian day.",
      "The increased size and payload capacity would allow this new helicopter to conduct more extensive scientific investigations and explore areas inaccessible to ground-based rovers. This advanced design could enable scientists to study large swaths of Martian terrain in detail and quickly, including places where rovers cannot safely travel.",

      "Overcoming challenges",
      "Before this new helicopter can take flight on Mars, NASA must address the challenges faced by Ingenuity. The smaller helicopter's crash landing in early 2024 provided valuable lessons for future designs. One key issue was navigation in featureless terrain.",
      "Ingenuity's vision-based navigation system struggled with the sandy, rippled surface of Jezero Crater. NASA engineer H\u00e5vard Grip explained, \"Lack of surface texture gave the navigation system too little information to work with.\"",
      "To overcome this, the next-generation helicopter will likely feature more advanced navigation systems capable of operating in varied Martian landscapes.",

    "summary": "Thieves who have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are attempting to steal, and an RFID wallet may not help you.",
    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",

      "Illustration of a car thief checking to see if the vehicle has an AirTag. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Alternatives to AirTags for car security",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

Then, one day, you find out that some company you've never heard of is selling your personal information to whoever wants to buy it. It's not just alarming. It could actually put your financial security at risk.",

      "There\u2019s one major way in which data brokers are endangering your retirement security, and it\u2019s right there in the name: data brokers buy, sell, trade and otherwise spread your personal information far and wide. This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",

      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails.

      "Real-world application",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is not just a concept; it's already being put to the test. In Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province, these robotic spheres are assisting police patrols in commercial zones. This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G's amphibious nature, high-speed capabilities and non-lethal arsenal make it a versatile tool for police forces. However, like any new technology, it raises questions about privacy, surveillance and the increasing automation of policing. The RT-G may be rolling into the future of law enforcement, but we must carefully consider the implications of deploying such advanced robotic systems in our communities.",

      "Nick Bostic, a former pizza deliveryman whose daring rescue of four children from a house fire was captured on heart-pounding body-camera footage, told Fox News Digital that he was home with his girlfriend when he found out Donald Trump Jr. re-posted the more than two-year-old video this week.",
      "The president-elect\u2019s son argued that Bostic should have been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 not the likes of Hillary Clinton and George Soros, who President Biden presented the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor to Sunday.",
      "\"This guy deserves the presidential medal of freedom\u2026 Not the clowns like Soros and the others who got it from Biden this week,\" Trump Jr. wrote on X, sharing the July 11, 2022, footage showing a home in Lafayette, Indiana, completely engulfed in flames. Elon Musk responded to the re-post, with one word: \"Yeah.\"",
      "As firefighters scrambled onto the scene, Bostic had already been inside the home and guided an 18-year-old woman with a baby and two 13-year-old girls to safety. He went back inside to rescue the remaining 6-year-old girl left behind, maneuvering through thick smoke and intense heat before he found the girl in a separate bedroom and scooped her up.",
      "He punched through an upstairs window and jumped out headfirst, turning his body to try to land on his back and cushion the blow for the girl to land on his stomach, Bostic told Fox News Digital.",

      "A police officer could be heard assuring him, \"Yeah, yeah. You did good, dude!\"",
      "\"You know, even though it was hard for me to breathe and stuff, it was so relaxing. And then, you know, knowing the girl was OK.\u2026 After the officer told me she was 100% fine, I just pretty much gave in right there to whatever was going to happen to me,\" Bostic told Fox News Digital, recalling that moment. \"You know, if I was not going to make it, so be it. But man, if I wasn't going to make it, I was going to die happy, you know?\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Bostic reacted to the newfound attention from President-elect Trump's eldest son, as well as Elon Musk.",
      "\"I was at home when I got the message from somebody. That Donald J. Trump Jr. had retweeted, you know, that video of me and I thought it was the craziest thing ever,\" Bostic said. \"Me and my girlfriend looked it up and we both found the post and then she went into the comments\u2026. Someone else had reached out to me about it and said Elon commented on it. And so she went. She's like, \u2018What? No way.\u2019 We both were.\"",

      "\"So she finds it first, he commented, 'Yeah.\u2019 So a gentleman like that, coming from him, that's all that man needs to say. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 like, that's probably a million words in one like that guy with what he does nowadays and what he's doing for the planet,\" Bostic added. \"To even get a yeah from him. Absolutely amazing. And then to get recognition from the man, the man. You know what I mean? President Trump's son. It's crazy. It's mind-blowing. It's mind-boggling.\"",
      "Describing himself as a \"die-hard Trump supporter,\" Bostic said he was optimistic about the new administration. \"Am I Team Trump? All the way, baby. I'm Team Trump,\" he said.",
      "\"He is really, really familiar with having a bunch of zeros in his bank account. And right now, with the economy and how things are, we need somebody that's going to be our leader. And that's good with numbers like that, you know, and because we can't afford to make errors and take chances on someone that's still learning,\" Bostic said. \"We're like Defcon four, you know what I mean? Like right now it's like we're in the red.\"",
      "\"Everybody deserves a chance at living a good life,\" Bostic added.",
      "The night of the fire, Bostic told Fox News Digital, he had gotten into a \"silly fight\" with his girlfriend. Bostic said he was off duty but still wearing his pizza delivery shirt when he decided to go for a drive to clear his head. On his way back, he spotted the blaze. The fact he was there to help is something he attributed to divine intervention.",

      "\"I'm a firm believer in God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I feel like he put me there at the right place at the right time,\" Bostic said. \"My whole life I didn't understand what my purpose was. I never fit in anywhere really.\"",
      "\"I tried taking my life a few times. Eventually, after like the third time, I just laughed about it and said, \u2018All right, God, you win. It ain\u2019t my time,'\" Bostic shared with Fox News Digital of his time after high school. \"So I stopped hurting my body and that's when I kind of, it kind of kicked in. Like, I think that was like God saying that I've got a bigger, greater purpose.\"",
      "Realizing that he had left his phone at home that night, and after attempting to flag down a passing car that didn\u2019t stop, Bostic said he ran around the back of the house on fire and entered through an unlocked door. Fearing he could be shot if he was mistaken as an intruder, he shouted repeatedly that the house was on fire. He soon found the 18-year-old, the teen girls and the baby.",
      "When Bostic turned around to rescue the 6-year-old girl, he recalled how the fire had already torn through the master bedroom and the hallway as he was met with \"this incredible wall of black, gray, mucky smoke.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s just like putting your foot into an oven. So I take a step back up. I'm scared at that point, you know? And then I hear \u2013 I hear a cry, a scream, cry,\" Bostic said. \"I didn't think or nothing, I just went in there. It was like just mentally throwing myself in front of the of the train, you know, and I doubled my shirt over my mouth for a filter. And I closed my eyes, and I followed her sounds and I picked her up in my arms.\"",

      "After his daring fire rescue in 2022, Bostic said the fire department personally handed him an application, but he\u2019s hesitant to join, partly because he wants time with his young son.",
      "As for Biden\u2019s controversial picks to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Bostic offered them congratulations.",
      "\"I don't have a perfect track history record or whatever either, you know?\" Bostic said. \"It's not always about what you did in your past. It's about what you do and make of your life in the future\u2026. It is what it is\u2026. I'm proud of them. Happy for them. And that's pretty much it.\"",
      "He argued that 9/11 first responders and law enforcement, as well as members of the military, were more deserving of accolades.",
      "\"I'm just a common citizen,\" Bostic said. \"It\u2019s not my place to judge something like that about myself. You know, and if people feel like I deserve it, I'm more than honored to take it\u2026 I\u2019m speechless.\"",

      "Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., chairman of the Helsinki Commission, and Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., are set to introduce the \"Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act\" on Wednesday.",

The United States cannot and will not recognize this illegitimate government. The Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act will ensure that the United States does not. Until it agrees to free and fair elections, the Ivanishvili regime must remain fully isolated by all democratic governments.\"",
      "While the Georgian Dream government did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comments, the party\u2019s political council released a statement on Wednesday saying the recently imposed sanctions are \"anti-Georgian steps\" orchestrated by the \"Global War Party\" and \"deep state\" networks, calling Rep. Wilson \"one of the most serious manifestations of the deep state\" and \"a degraded politician.\"",
      "In its nature and goals, the \"Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act\u2019\u2019 resembles Rep. Wilson-led 2023 \"Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act,\" which passed last February. The bill was passed in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2025 and was signed into law by President Biden last month.",

After January 20th, these members of Congress will have even more influence on U.S. foreign policymaking,\" Coffey said.",

    "summary": "Special Counsel Jack Smith has turned over to Attorney General Merrick Garland the completed final report on his two investigations that resulted in felony criminal charges against President-elect Donald Trump, part of which Garland intends to make public, the Justice Department said in a filing Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith has turned over to Attorney General Merrick Garland the completed final report on his two investigations that resulted in felony charges against President-elect Donald Trump, part of which Garland intends to make public as long as a federal appeals court vacates an injunction put in place by a Trump-appointed judge, the Justice Department said in a filing Wednesday.",
      "The filing to a federal appeals court\u2014 which was made by the Justice Department separate from Smith's office \u2014 came after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon temporarily blocked the release of the report until three days after the 11th Circuit rules on a pending request to block the report. Cannon is the Florida judge who tossed the charges against Trump, siding with an argument that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional.",
      "But the Justice Department said Wednesday there was \"neither any need nor legal basis for an injunction\" on the release of the report because Garland intends to give Congress only volume one \u2014 which focuses on Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter.\"",
      "Garland will not publicly release volume two of the report as long as the cases against Trump's co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira remain pending. The 11th circuit on Wednesday ordered lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveira to reply by 5 p.m.",
      "The Justice Department's filing said that they would not release any material from volume two, which is the only portion of the report that is relevant to the classified documents case.",
      "\"For the time being, Volume Two will be made available for in camera review only by the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees upon their request and agreement not to release any information from Volume Two publicly,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.\u00a0\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the Department while safeguarding defendants\u2019 interests.\"",
      "Justice Department attorneys asked the federal appeals court to \"make clear that there is no impediment to the Attorney General allowing for limited congressional review\" of the volume of the report on Trump's classified documents case, along with the public release of the volume on Trump's election interference case.",
      "The Justice Department is also asking the 11th\u00a0Circuit to vacate Cannon\u2019s temporary injunction blocking the release of any portion of the report for three days following a ruling by the circuit court. That three-day window would theoretically give Trump time to seek intervention from the Supreme Court to block the release of volume one of the report. If the circuit court grants DOJ\u2019s request and overturns Cannon\u2019s order, volume one could be released any time after that.",
      "Cannon has been criticized for repeatedly siding with Trump in the case, including in her decision to toss the charges against him. Some of those decisions, including her handling of a search of his Florida residence, have been reversed, with criticism that she acted without legal basis."

    "story": [
      "The New Orleans truck attacker built two bombs using what investigators believe was an explosive so powerful that they could have sprayed shrapnel hundreds of yards and potentially killed or wounded hundreds of people.",
      "The bombs did not detonate on New Year\u2019s Day. But experts say the devices Shamsud-Din Jabbar built with a compound believed to be RDX would have had devastating effects were it not for an amateurish blunder.",
      "\u201cAs horrible as it is that he killed and injured all of these people, it could have been exponentially worse in the truest sense of the term had these devices actually functioned,\u201d said Scott Sweetow, a retired executive with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and former director of the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center. \u201cYou\u2019d be looking at literally hundreds of casualties.\u201d",
      "A bomb made with RDX going off in a tourist section of New Orleans would be the equivalent of multiple hand grenades thrown into a crowded street, Sweetow said.",
      "\u201cIt would have been absolute carnage,\u201d he added.",
      "The bombs failed to go off because Jabbar used the wrong device to detonate the explosive, federal law enforcement officials have said.",
      "He used an electric match, which could set off a typical pipe bomb made with powder explosives. But a compound like RDX is vastly more difficult to set off. It\u2019s considered a high explosive material, meaning it won\u2019t detonate without a primary explosion occurring near it \u2014 initiated by what\u2019s known as a blasting cap or detonator.",
      "Three explosive experts interviewed by NBC News said they were baffled that Jabbar seemingly knew to use a little-known compound more powerful than TNT but not how to get it to detonate.",
      "\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Tony May, a retired ATF agent who also worked as an Army explosive enforcement officer in Afghanistan.",
      "By using RDX, experts say Jabbar was mimicking the tactics of terrorist groups operating in the Middle East, where it is far easier to obtain. The vast majority of bomb attacks in the U.S. involve powder explosives that are simpler to make and far less powerful.",
      "\u201cThe thing to me that is most troubling is that other people may try to do this now,\u201d said David Hyche, a former ATF agent who is now the chief of police in Calera, Alabama.",
      "Jabbar, 42, an Army veteran from Texas who was inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group, killed 14 people and injured dozens when he drove a rented pick-up truck down a blocked-off section of Bourbon Street at about 3:15 a.m. on Jan. 1. After carving a three-block path of destruction, he was shot dead in a gunbattle with police.",
      "Roughly an hour earlier, Jabbar had put his homemade bombs inside two coolers and placed them on Bourbon Street, the famous party area in the heart of the French Quarter. It remains unclear if he resorted to the truck attack because the bombs failed to detonate or if using the truck to kill was always a part of his plan. Jabbar also had a handgun and a semiautomatic rifle with a privately made silencer, according to law enforcement officials.",
      "At his home in Houston, investigators found explosive materials that field tests identified as RDX. They also found explosive materials at a home he rented in New Orleans that tests initially identified as R-Salt, an explosive similar in chemical makeup to RDX. But the ATF said Sunday that it now believes that more thorough lab tests will show that it, too, was RDX.",
      "RDX is not easy to obtain in the United States. A military-grade explosive, it\u2019s also used for specialized purposes by demolition and mining companies and can only be purchased with a federal license. Criminals have been known to get their hands on stolen RDX, but multiple experts told NBC News they suspect Jabbar synthesized it himself \u2014 a time-consuming and highly dangerous endeavor.",
      "That theory is based on footage shot inside Jabbar\u2019s Houston home by the New York Post, which showed a property receipt listing items the federal investigators had seized, including common lab materials and precursor chemicals like acetone, sulfuric acid and potassium nitrate.",
      "\u201cThere is no indication he had the requisite knowledge to do this on his own,\u201d said Sweetow, the former ATF and FBI official. \u201cSo he would have had to have either received information from outside sources, or done significant research on the Internet.\u201d",
      "Terrorist groups in the Middle East have bombmakers who synthesize their own high explosives but that is rarely seen in the U.S. The two most well-known cases of that are the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.",
      "Had Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, used RDX, the attack would have been even more catastrophic, experts said.",
      "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have had one building blown down,\u201d said Hyche, the former ATF agent-turned-police chief. \u201cYou\u2019d have multiple buildings blown down.\u201d",
      "Building a bomb with RDX is also more challenging and more dangerous.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t have the skillset for that, and they\u2019re not willing to follow a recipe,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cPeople kill themselves all the time trying to make this stuff because they\u2019re not that skilled of a chemist.\u201d",
      "The retired ATF officials said investigators are almost certainly looking into how Jabbar gained the knowledge to use a compound like RDX. Was he working directly with a member of ISIS or another terror group? Or did he find instructions in an obscure corner of the internet?",
      "\u201cIf someone told him how to do this stuff, where are they?\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cAnd is this part of a trend?\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden in an interview published Wednesday said he still believes he could have defeated President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 election but isn't sure if he could have served a full second term.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,\u201d Biden told USA Today during a wide-ranging interview when asked if he could have won had he not exited the campaign in July.",
      "Biden said that he still thinks that he could have defeated Trump because of the polls he had reviewed, according to USA Today. He wasn't confident, however, that he could have served a full second term. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.",
      "Before Biden had dropped out of the 2024 race in July, some polls showed he was trailing Trump or the race was in a dead heat.",
      "When he announced his decision to withdraw, Biden said, \u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"",
      "Biden immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, and later said in a prime-time address that he thought \"the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\"",
      "His decision came after weeks of intensifying pressure from leaders within his own party, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to pull out of the presidential race. The growing revolt followed Biden's devastating debate performance in late June, which put his health, age and cognitive abilities in question.",
      "Some Democrats later expressed that the wish that Biden had decided not to run for re-election, or at least drop out much earlier in the process.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The Senate investigation of Apollo Global Management's purchase of Lifepoint Healthcare and Leonard Green & Partners' purchase of Prospect Medical Holdings reinforced the findings of past research.",
    "story": [
      "A yearlong\u00a0bipartisan congressional investigation\u00a0into two private equity-backed U.S. hospital systems found that patient care deteriorated at both operations as their private equity owners reaped significant payouts on their investments in the systems. The findings reinforced academic research showing how private equity health care investments harm patients while enriching investors.",
      "The investigation was helmed by two senators who lead the Senate Budget Committee  \u2014 Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.",
      "The inquiry centered on private equity giant Apollo Global Management, owner of Lifepoint Healthcare, the nation\u2019s largest operator of rural hospitals, and Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm in Los Angeles that owned hospitals under the Prospect Medical Holdings umbrella from 2010 to 2021.",
      "Over the past decade,\u00a0private-equity firms\u00a0like Apollo and Leonard Green have spent more than $1 trillion buying health care businesses, including hospitals, nursing homes, physician practices and\u00a0hospital staffing companies.\u00a0To finance these deals,\u00a0private equity owners typically\u00a0burden\u00a0the companies they buy with debt, then slash company costs to increase earnings and appeal to potential buyers in subsequent years.\u00a0\u00a0Because private equity firms do not make public the financial results of the companies they own, Senate investigators aimed to assess how much profit the private equity firms generated from their investments in the hospitals and whether the deals harmed patients.",
      "\u201cAs our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\u201d Whitehouse said in a statement. \u201cPrivate equity investors have pocketed\u00a0millions\u00a0while driving hospitals into the ground and then selling them off, leaving towns and communities to pick up the pieces.\u201d",
      "Academic studies show that private equity firms\u2019 involvement in health care is associated with significant cost increases for patients and payers, such as Medicare. A lower quality of care is also associated with private equity firms\u2019 investments in health care. Patients receiving care at hospitals owned by private equity firms\u00a0also experienced more bloodstream and surgical site infections and fell more often, a 2023 study by academics at Harvard University and the University of Chicago found.",
      "Adding to this research, the Senate investigation found that whenever Prospect Medical facilities showed financial improvements over the period of private equity ownership, rather than investing in hospital operations to benefit patients, the owners induced the company to issue new debt, using proceeds to pay dividends to themselves.",
      "For example, the investigation found that Prospect Medical Holdings paid out $645 million in dividends and preferred stock redemption to its investors \u2014 $424 million of which went to Leonard Green investors \u2014 and took out hundreds of millions in loans that it eventually defaulted on.",
      "Likewise, the Senate investigation found that Apollo Global Management underinvested in Ottumwa Regional\u00a0Health\u00a0Center, a Lifepoint facility in rural Iowa that the inquiry scrutinized.",
      "At that facility, a male nurse was found to have sexually assaulted multiple incapacitated female patients before dying of a drug overdose in October 2022. Senate investigators concluded that, \u201cthis\u00a0event may have occurred because of unfulfilled promises and underinvestment, which eroded the hospital\u2019s culture of safety.\u201d",
      "While the hospital declined, Apollo received millions of dollars a year, the report said.",
      "\u201cA dependable health care system is essential to the vitality of a community,\u201d Grassley said in a statement. \u201cAs always, sunshine is the best disinfectant. This report is a step toward ensuring accountability, so that hospitals\u2019 financial structures can best serve patients\u2019 medical needs.\u201d",
      "Prospect said it was still reviewing the Senate report and was disappointed by \u201cits false conclusions and apparent omissions of key facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Committee\u2019s report seems not to acknowledge our many positive contributions to the communities we serve or to accurately reflect the focus on quality of care and patient safety at our hospitals,\u201d Prospect added. \u201cThe Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level.\u201d",
      "In addition, the company said, \u201cNearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy. In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\u00a0Prospect invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients. That is the exact opposite of putting profits above patients.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Apollo disputed the report\u2019s findings as well.\u00a0\u201cApollo Funds have invested billions of dollars in Lifepoint and its predecessor companies, which has been used to\u00a0improve facilities,\u00a0expand local healthcare services,\u00a0recruit care providers, build new centers of care and upgrade technology across Lifepoint\u2019s network,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cApollo Funds continue to support Lifepoint management\u2019s emphasis on continuous improvements in quality of care, including at Ottumwa Regional Health Center.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a result of these investments, quality of care at Lifepoint hospitals has improved, according to third party ratings like Leapfrog as well as CMS Star Ratings,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cAt a time when many rural hospitals are under pressure and at risk of closing, Lifepoint has not had to close a single hospital and is committed to providing critical services in underserved areas.\u201d",
      "Representatives from Lifepoint Health\u00a0and\u00a0Leonard Green & Partners\u00a0did not\u00a0immediately\u00a0respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Senate report also shows the impact that the hospitals\u2019 private equity owners had over the entities\u2019 operations. A June 2022 employee satisfaction survey from Ottumwa cited in the report stated, \u201cAs far as our hospital being part of Lifepoint, it feels like we are a number, a budget, anything but a care giving institution.\u201d",
      "After Prospect installed a management audit committee of the board to oversee financial operations, board documents indicated some of the committee\u2019s members \u201chad felt pressured to keep certain things quiet,\u201d the report said.",
      "The attorney general in New Mexico, Raul Torrez, launched an investigation of a Lifepoint-run facility in Las Cruces \u2014 Memorial Medical Center \u2014 after NBC News reported last year that the facility had turned away\u00a0a dozen\u00a0cancer patients. The former chief executive of the facility resigned shortly after the report.",
      "Memorial\u2019s chief financial officer said at the time\u00a0that the hospital did not turn away patients and Lifepoint said that \u201cmany of the assertions being made about Memorial\u2019s practices, conduct and communications with patients are factually inaccurate.\u201d",
      "Neither Memorial nor Lifepoint would identify specific inaccuracies or discuss the experiences of the\u00a0patients, which were shared with the hospital.\u00a0Hospital officials called some of them to apologize after they had told NBC News their story."

    "story": [
      "The North Carolina Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday that blocks state officials from certifying the Democratic candidate as the winner of a razor-thin race for the state\u2019s high court.",
      "In a 4-2 vote, all but one of the Republicans on the state Supreme court ruled to prevent the North Carolina State Board of Elections from certifying the results of the race, where Democratic Justice Allison Riggs holds a 734-vote lead over Republican Jefferson Griffin. Riggs recused herself from Tuesday\u2019s order.",
      "The decision by the court that Griffin is seeking to join, and that Riggs is seeking to remain on, allows the justices to now hear a challenge from Griffin that seeks to throw out 60,000 votes cast in November.",
      "The order vowed to address the issue \u201cexpeditiously\u201d and outlined a schedule that sets a deadline for all briefs in the case to be filed by Jan. 24.",
      "Riggs, who was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 2023, emerged from Election Day with a narrow advantage over Griffin, triggering a series of recounts. A full machine recount and a partial hand recount showed Riggs leading Griffin by 734 votes, out of more than 5.5 million ballots cast.",
      "Griffin subsequently filed hundreds of legal challenges across all of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties, claiming that nearly 60,000 people voted illegally. Lawyers for Griffin and the North Carolina Republican Party alleged that many of those voters didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license number or Social Security number on file in their voter registration records. The allegations were also related to overseas voters who haven\u2019t lived in North Carolina and who failed to provide photo identification with their ballots.",
      "But the state elections board, where Democrats have a 3-2 majority, rejected all three categories of protests by Griffin last month. That prompted Griffin to ask the state Supreme Court to take up his challenges.",
      "The case was initially heard in federal court because the North Carolina Democratic Party had pre-emptively filed a federal suit in December that sought to ensure that all ballots in the race were counted.",
      "But on Monday, the federal judge hearing the case \u2014 an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 sent it back to the state level, siding with a request from Griffin. North Carolina's board of elections has filed an appeal of that decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, but that court has not scheduled initial briefs until February. Riggs' campaign on Wednesday requested that the court expedite its hearing of the case.",
      "\"The people of North Carolina deserve a swift resolution and Justice Riggs will prevail,\u201d Riggs campaign spokesperson Embry Owen said in a statement.",
      "In its Tuesday order, four of the five Republican justices on the state Supreme Court wrote that because the federal court remanded the case back to the state level, it would grant Griffin\u2019s request for the election\u2019s certification to be blocked so it could evaluate the claims regarding the 60,000 votes.",
      "The lone Republican dissenter, Richard Dietz, wrote under a legal doctrine known as the \"Purcell principle,\" intervention by the judiciary close to an election \"becomes inappropriate because it can damage the integrity of the election process.\"",
      "He called Griffin's quest \"post-election litigation that seeks to remove the legal right to vote from people who lawfully voted under the laws and regulations that existed during the voting process.\"",
      "\"The harm this type of post-election legal challenge could inflict on the integrity of our elections is precisely what the Purcell principle is designed to avoid,\" Dietz added, before adding that he did \"believe some of these legal challenges likely have merit.\"",
      "The lone Democrat on the court who voted wrote in a dissent that \u201cthe standard for a temporary stay has not been met here,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no likelihood of success on the merits and the public interest requires that the Court not interfere with the ordinary course of democratic processes as set by statute and the state constitution.\u201d",

      "Senate Democrats planned to discuss the bill at their weekly lunch Tuesday, said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. He said his view is that the legislation would complicate current immigration law.",
      "\"I just don't think it's a good bill. I think it's going to make the immigration system written as is much, much, much more complicated, byzantine and confusing because of this new right it provides for attorneys general to litigate detainment cases in court,\" Murphy said Tuesday.",
      "\"It's just not a well-constructed piece of legislation,\" he said."

      "A \"skit\" at a fraternity party that left a pledge with burns over 16% of his body led to authorities filing charges against four San Diego State University\u00a0students, including the person who was injured.",
      "Caden Cooper, 22, Lucas Cowling, 20, Christopher Serrano, 20, and Lars Larsen, 19, were arraigned Monday and pleaded not guilty to charges including recklessly causing a fire with great bodily injury, conspiracy to commit an act injurious to the public, and violating the social host ordinance, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office said in a news release.",
      "The charges stem from a Feb. 17 Phi Kappa Psi party that left Larsen injured with burns. At the time of the party, the fraternity was on probation by the university, the release states.",
      "All four students were active members and pledges of Phi Kappa Psi, officials said. Cooper was the fraternity\u2019s president, Cowling was on the pledge board, and Serrano and Larsen were pledges.",
      "The district attorney's office said Phi Kappa Psi threw a large party at their fraternity house and Cowling, Serrano, and Larsen \"pre-planned a skit during which Serrano would set Larsen on fire.\"",
      "\"After consuming alcohol in Cowling\u2019s presence, the underage students executed the skit which caused burns to Larsen on 16% of his body, primarily on his legs. Larsen spent weeks in the hospital for treatment of third-degree burns,\" the office said.",

      "It's not clear if the students have obtained attorneys who can speak on their behalf. Phi Kappa Psi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
      "The university said it was alerted to the incident after receiving an anonymous call in February reporting the hazing. The fraternity has been on an interim suspension, temporarily halting organizational activities while an investigation is conducted.",
      "\"The university has taken additional actions, but because of student privacy laws, those actions can not be disclosed,\" the school said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "The university said it reported the incident to university police, which presented it to the district attorney\u2019s office. The school has also launched an administrative investigation that \"addresses both individual student conduct and the conduct of the organization involved.\"",
      "\"The university prioritizes the health and safety of our campus community and has high expectations for how all members of the university community, including students, behave in the interest of individual and community safety and wellbeing,\" the school said.",
      "The students were released on their own recognizance and were prohibited from participating in any fraternity parties or any recruitment events for the fraternity. They are due back in court on March 18.",
      "If convicted of all the charges, they face a sentencing range of probation up to seven years and two months in prison."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 20:06:30 GMT",
    "summary": "There's momentum among pro-immigration groups and some Democrats for policies that would move the party to the right on immigration.",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office and carry out what he has promised will be the \u201clargest deportation effort in U.S. history,\u201d there is gaining momentum among pro-immigration groups and some Democrats for policies that would move the party to the right on immigration. The shift some are advocating would at once see a push to cut the number of people coming into the country while at the same time advocating for revamping pathways for immigrants to come into the country legally based on the needs of the economy and humanitarian relief.",
      "Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, Texas, presented similar ideas in a 2023 bill known as the Dignity Act with a Republican colleague, Rep. Maria Salazar of Florida. The bill would have mandated that all employers of a certain size participate in the E-Verify program to check that employees are authorized to work in the U.S. and provided $25 billion to border security, while also allowing a path to citizenship for Dreamers and improved visa programs to fill key sectors of the U.S. economy such as farming and health care.",
      "The bill was never brought for a vote in the House, but Escobar says she has reasons to hope some of those ideas may see the light of day this Congress, even with Trump promising crackdowns on immigrants.",
      "Escobar noted Trump will likely need legislative action on immigration to carry out his campaign promises.",
      "\u201cIf they want to change the law, they will very likely need to work with Democrats,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true in the House, where the margin is so slim.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reality is we still need immigration reform and we need immigrants in this country, and no amount of demonizing them will change that fact,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cWe have an aging population. Families are not as large as they used to be. We need immigrants of all skill sets.\u201d",
      "Still, some Democrats in both the House and Senate are reluctant to step into the debate until they can see what Trump has in store regarding deportations. Several declined to be interviewed for this article for that reason.",
      "In the first Trump administration, Democrats offered a foil to Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration measures, including separating children from their parents, forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico, and deporting immigrants back to countries that were not their own. They were more likely to advocate for the protection of asylum-seekers than to talk about ramping up border security to limit those who could claim asylum at the southern border.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s second victory, some Democrats have changed their strategy.",
      "To some extent the shift began even during the campaign, as Trump criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s border policies. In a bipartisan immigration package ultimately squelched when pro-Trump members refused to bring it to a vote in the House, Democrats largely agreed to measures that would have increased border security. Now, as Trump prepares to take office, some are hopeful some of the ideas from that bipartisan package as well as Escobar and Salazar\u2019s Dignity Act could have a second life.",
      "Many of the ideas from the Dignity Act are included and taken a step further in a plan released Wednesday by\u00a0FWD.us,\u00a0a prominent pro-immigration organization chaired by David Plouffe, the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign manager who most recently served as a senior adviser to the Harris-Walz campaign.",
      "The plan was written by Andrea Flores, a former administration official under Biden and under former President Barack Obama.",
      "\u201cWe must widen the aperture of the current policy debate, learn from the past decade of policies that failed to manage mass migration, and build political support for a more effective set of solutions,\u201d wrote Flores, who is now the vice president of immigration policy and campaigns at\u00a0FWD.us.",
      "The plan attempts to solve the problem of overwhelming border numbers that plagued the Biden administration, a problem Flores traces back to the Obama administration, when there was a sharp increase in the number of migrants claiming asylum at the border in 2014. Flores also points to an over-reliance by multiple administrations, including the first Trump administration, on Mexico and other Western Hemisphere countries to stop the flow of migrants to the southern border.",
      "One of the most developed proposals in the paper builds on a Biden administration policy that allowed 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to apply to live and work in the United States for up to two years with the help of a U.S.-based sponsor.",
      "The program\u00a0has brought in over 800,000 migrants but has had problems with possible sponsor fraud, as NBC News previously reported.",
      "In the policy proposal, Flores said a better legal pathways plan would allow the United States to better select migrants who qualify for asylum or who may fill a specific need in the economy, similar to Escobar\u2019s bill. She also argued the program should allow migrants to stay longer than two years.",
      "The \u201ctemporary nature\u201d of the Biden policy \u201censures that the majority of beneficiaries will still ultimately apply for asylum and enter the years-long asylum backlog,\u201d she wrote.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Flores said Trump\u2019s plan for mass deportations does not solve problems related to border security, but she believes new policies that reduce migration to the border should be pushed by Democrats now.",
      "She added that it\u2019s important for Democrats to have an answer on the border security debate rather than to focus solely on immigrants, like Dreamers, who are already living in the United States and their possible pathway to citizenship.",
      "\u201cIt is totally disconnected and not evidence-based to say that removing what will have to be largely Mexican nationals will have any deterrent effect on Mexican numbers, which are not the actual issue at the border,\u201d Flores said. \u201cOur immigration policies are all about the border right now, which is why it\u2019s really important for Democrats to have a coherent answer on that piece.\u201d"

Hunter Biden, the son of the president's first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, who died in a car accident when he was a little boy, has often grabbed headlines over the last four years as he faced federal charges and scrutiny over his addictions.",

      "Maria Shriver gleaned at least one solid parenting tip from her late mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.",
      "The author and entrepreneur recently joined TODAY's Hoda Kotb at the Making Space Wellness Weekend in Texas. In a conversation that's featured in the Jan. 8 episode of Hoda's podcast, \"Making Space,\" Shriver recalled the one mannerism she instilled in her children after watching her own mother over the years.",
      "Hoda remembered Shriver told her that her children stand up when she enters a room.",
      "\u201cI make them stand up,\u201d Shriver said. \u201cI used to make them. Now they just do stand up.\"",
      "Shriver, a mother of four, went on to explain that the practice is something she previously watched her own mother do.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s many things that I\u2019ve emulated from my mother, but my grandmother and my mother were big on manners. So, you know, when somebody who was older walked in the room, aka my mother, everybody stood up,\u201d she noted.",
      "Shriver then described how this piece of etiquette also extended to conversations in her household.",
      "\"When we went to the dinner table, everybody had to have something to bring to the table to talk about, to converse about. My mother would be like, 'What\u2019s your opinion of the gospel? What\u2019s your opinion of what the president said today?' And you could be 10, 11, 19, 20, but you had to like step up,\" she said.",
      "When she became a mother herself, Shriver was intentional about teaching her children to respect others.",
      "\"I wanted my kids to, you know, when I walked in the room, or their dad walked in the room, or you would walk in the room, that they stand up out of respect,\" she said.",
      "Shriver also sought to instill a sense of respect in her kids' friends when they came over to her house.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to walk in the room, and they\u2019d be sitting looking at a phone or watching the game. I\u2019d be like, 'I'm here. Here we are, and here I am. And look me in the eye, say hello, thank me for coming, write me a thank you note if I take you somewhere.' That sort of stuff. And even though my kids moaned and groaned about it, they now say it was a good thing,\" she said.",
      "Shiver shares two daughters, Katherine, 35, and Christina, 33, and two sons, Patrick, 31, and Christopher, 27, with ex-husband Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "While talking about her parenting style, Shriver said her own childhood as a member of a famous family helped inform the way she parented her own children.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was really important that I raise children who felt like they were a priority in a public family,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to guard their privacy. I wanted to make sure they were not part of political pamphlets, that they were not used as props, that they were the stars of our home. ... that they feel they were of equal importance to whatever their mom or dad was doing, that they were valued, that they were four distinct individuals, but also, collectively, a family.\u201d"

      "Amanda Seyfried has starred in her fair share of dramatic roles, but had no idea that her distant relative's life was like something out of a soap opera.",
      "While appearing on the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots,\" the 39-year-old made some shocking discoveries about her family.",
      "With the help of the show's host, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Seyfried traced her ancestry back four generations and learned about a relative named John Peter Ebert who was born in Germany in 1844.",
      "After immigrating to the U.S., Ebert found work as a baker in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Seyfried grew up. Ebert later married a woman named Amanda and started a family.",
      "\"He's created his own kingdom,\" Seyfried marveled in the episode that aired on Jan. 7.",
      "Sadly, Ebert's story doesn't have a happy ending. Seyfried's ancestor was shot and killed while leaving his home one day \u2014 a tragedy that was news to Seyfried.",
      "\"It\u2019s weird. I don't know him but he's family and I'm just like, 'How dare they!' Like, find justice,\" Seyfried said.",
      "The search for Ebert's killer became a major news story, dredging up Ebert's past. Police discovered that Ebert had fathered an illegitimate son named Herbert, who soon became a prime suspect.",
      "Ebert's widow Amanda reluctantly revealed that her late husband had previously had an affair with a woman named Mary who lived in a public home for the poor. Ebert met Mary while working in the public home as a baker. Allegedly, Ebert was then let go from his job. Unbeknownst to Ebert, Mary got pregnant and gave up their son for adoption. She went on to marry and kept her son's father's identity a secret.",
      "When Herbert's identity was made public following Ebert's death, he was able to provide an alibi. He told local police that he was under the impression that a man named Peter Ebert was his father, and that he had only met him once. When Herbert read in the newspaper that he was a suspect in Ebert's death, he realized he was his father.",
      "Seyfried described the story as a \"soap opera\" and said, \"These poor people.\"",
      "Reflecting on the effects this scandal must have had on Amanda and Mary, Seyfried described the situation as \"so twisted.\"",
      "\"To harbor that and know you have this kid out in the world. Horrible. Hard,\" the actor said. \"It's just gotta feel like a knife in the stomach being twisted every day.\"",
      "Eventually, police discovered that Ebert was shot by a neighbor in a failed robbery attempt. Looking back on her ancestor's infidelity and eventual fate, Seyfried offered the following reflections.",
      "\"He was a human. He made a mistake. He put some lives in turmoil and he had to make choices. He had a lot of kids and a business and he wanted to keep his life, and he made choices that ensured that his life would be saved. Selfish as that is, he was also protecting his kids so I can turn that story around. He didn't have to be shot,\" she said.",

      "The show did a bit of research, and it turns out Malhabor was more likely a naturalist than a physicist. He most likely arrived in the Philippines in the early 1870s when European naturalists visited the island on an exploratory mission. The show posited that Malhabor was among them.",
      "Gates' team found a baptism record for Malhabor's son that revealed Malhabor was from Prussia, a territory that included parts of Germany, Poland and Russia. More specifically, Malhabor likely came from modern day Germany. His wife, meanwhile, came Manila, the capital of the Philippines.",

      "\"I think so. I think at that point, everybody would've been quiet,\" she agreed.",
      "The episode also explored her father's side of the family tree. Her paternal grandfather, Feliciano P. Salonga, was born in the Philippines in 1894.",
      "After enlisting in the U.S. Navy, he worked in the boiler room of a ship.",
      "\u201cHe didn't see it as drudge work. He saw it as a way to better his own life,\u201d Salonga explained.",
      "The actor's grandfather was 47 years old when World War II broke out and had just been transferred back to Manila. Japanese forces had taken control of his homeland and massacres were common at the time. He was in particular danger since he was associated with the U.S. military.",
      "Salonga's grandfather went missing for some time at this point. Gates asked the star how she thought this may have impacted her own father, who was 12 at the time.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:11:22 GMT",
    "summary": "What happened to Jerry Springer? What did Jerry Springer die of? What did he say about his legacy?",
    "story": [
      "Fights. Racists. Adultery. Overall mayhem. \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show,\u201d which aired nearly 4,000 episodes between 1991 and 2018, was home to all four. Yet at its center, host Jerry Springer (who died in 2023) was an ocean of calm wading through a sea of muck and controversy.",
      "\u201cJerry was warm and charismatic and empathetic and he did care about people but you certainly wouldn\u2019t know it from the show that bore his name,\u201d former Chicago media critic Robert Feder, who is interviewed in a new Netflix documentary, \u201cJerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action,\u201d tells TODAY.com. \u201cHe made it acceptable for people to watch the show and consider everything that they were being exposed to as entertainment.\u201d",
      "How did the lawyer, politician and Emmy-winning news reporter become the so-called King of Trash TV? Here's what we know about the man who believed he \u201cruined the culture\u201d with his program.",
      "What was Jerry Springer\u2019s early career like?",
      "The UK-born son of German Jewish refugees, Springer actually came into the world in a subway station while his mother sheltered from German bombs during World War II, as NBC News reported in 2023. After his family immigrated to New York City when he was young, he went on to earn a law degree and join the advisory team to Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.",
      "Springer settled in Ohio and won a seat on the Cincinnati city council when he was just 27 in 1971. But he resigned in 1974 after paying for a sex worker with a check, which he confessed to in a public apology, as Cincinnati publication WCPO recalled.",
      "He got elected back to city council again a year later and in 1977 became Cincinnati\u2019s mayor. After a failed run at the Ohio governor\u2019s seat, he moved into TV by reporting on the news. As an anchor, he earned 10 local Emmy Awards, Cincinnati Magazine reported in 1992.",
      "\u201cThe Jerry Springer Show\u201d launched in 1991 taping out of Chicago. Early on the show focused on news and issues: Oliver North and Jesse Jackson were among early guest, and as WVXU wrote, topics included \u201chomelessness, AIDS, domestic violence, race and equality.\u201d",
      "But when ratings tumbled, the show hired former tabloid newsman Richard Dominick and the series evolved into the chair-throwing, headline-grabbing, chaotic beast that would ultimately topple \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in the ratings, running for decades.",
      "\u201cHe was a man of enormous gifts and talents and potential, and it\u2019s sad that he squandered it,\u201d Feder tells TODAY.com. \u201cHe was a good guy, but he sold out and his name will forever be attached to the worst television show of all time.\u201d",
      "What did Jerry Springer say about his show \u2014 and its legacy?",
      "Springer spoke about \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show,\" its legacy and its effect on culture with a self-aware tone.",
      "And as he noted on \u201cThe Roseanne Show,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country that watches my show, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t watch the show, but it\u2019s not aimed at 66-year-old men,\u201d Springer told the Associated Press, via TODAY, in 2010. \u201cIf I were in college, I would watch. I enjoy doing it. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Once the show was over, he was somewhat more forthcoming on its long-term ramifications. On the \u201cBehind the Velvet Rope\u201d podcast in 2022, Springer said, jokingly, \u201cI just apologize. I\u2019m so sorry. What have I done? I\u2019ve ruined the culture.\u201d",
      "What happened to Jerry Springer?",
      "\u201cJerry loved being a star,\u201d Dominick says in the documentary.",
      "After his show went off the air in 2018, Springer made efforts to remain in the public eye. He launched a courtroom show in 2019 called \u201cJudge Jerry\u201d that lasted for three seasons. He continued to host shows like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d \u201cWWE Raw\u201d and a dating program called \u201cBaggage.\u201d He also dipped his toe into acting, including starring in a 1998 film called \u201cRingmaster\u201d playing a character loosely based on himself.",
      "He also competed on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d in 2022 and danced on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d in 2006 \u2014 in part so he could learn to waltz for his daughter\u2019s wedding.",
      "Springer died in April, 2023 at age 79, TODAY reported. A family spokesperson said he had a recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",
      "\u201cJerry\u2019s ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried, whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word,\u201d family spokesperson and his longtime friend Jean Galvin said.ruin"

      "\u201cAt the end of a 42-day ceasefire, that is beyond when the president will be inaugurated,\u201d Witkoff told reporters Tuesday. \u201cSo it will be the president who is going to be most relevant.

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 The Biden administration has been in talks with the Taliban to exchange Americans detained in Afghanistan for Afghans in U.S. custody, a senior Taliban leader with direct knowledge of the negotiations told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The Taliban leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said the two sides had been negotiating for the past two years but had so far failed to reach a deal.",
      "He said the Taliban had demanded three Afghan nationals including Muhammad Rahim, the only Afghan prisoner left at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, a detention site in Cuba for the mostly Muslim men taken into custody around the world in the U.S. \u201cwar on terror.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say Rahim, who has been held there without charge since 2008, was a senior aide in Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Others say he held a much lesser role as a courier and translator and is not a national security threat.",
      "\u201cHis mother has been protesting and made several demands for his release,\u201d the Taliban leader said.",
      "The Taliban leader, who said he has personally participated in some of the meetings with U.S. officials, confirmed that the Taliban had captured three American nationals in the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the U.S. administration will make it happen as they are very interested in getting back their three nationals currently held in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "He did not name the three Americans, whom he said were accused of spying and preaching Christianity in Afghanistan. But the Taliban have previously confirmed they are holding Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann, both of whom the State Department has classified as wrongfully detained.",
      "Corbett, a longtime resident of Afghanistan before the U.S. withdrawal, was arrested while on a business trip to the country in August 2022, while Glezmann was arrested during a trip to Afghanistan in December of that year. Both men are said to have experienced declining health during their detention.",
      "The Taliban have not confirmed whether they are holding a third person, Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American who worked for an American consulting group and was arrested in his native Afghanistan in August 2022 after the U.S. drone strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.",
      "In addition to Rahim, the Taliban leader said, Afghan officials also demanded the release of two other Afghan nationals imprisoned in the United States who \u201chave nothing to do with terrorism or politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe charges leveled against them are different and we will hopefully get them back to the Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said that \u201cthe safety and security of Americans overseas is one of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s top priorities, and we are working around the clock to ensure George, Ryan, and Mahmood\u2019s safe return.\"",
      "The spokesperson said that \"President Biden and his team continue to work, often in partnership with key allies, to negotiate for the release of Americans held hostage or unjustly detained abroad so that they can be reunited with their families, and the Administration will do so throughout the remainder of the term.\u201d",
      "According to a 2014 Senate report, the Central Intelligence Agency subjected Rahim, who was captured in Pakistan, to enhanced interrogation techniques that included sleep deprivation sessions lasting up to almost six days. They did not produce any intelligence.",
      "Rahim is currently ineligible to leave Guant\u00e1namo, having been deemed a continuing national security threat by a federal review panel multiple times, most recently in November 2023.",
      "The U.S.-Taliban negotiations were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "In the past four years, Biden has brought back more than 75 American citizens and residents detained around the world, including three from China in a prisoner swap this fall and four from Russia in a multinational prisoner swap last summer. In 2022, Biden approved the release of an Afghan drug lord in U.S. custody in exchange for Navy veteran Mark Frerichs, who was held captive in Afghanistan for 2\u00bd years.",
      "But agreeing to release an Afghan prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo could be politically trickier for Biden, who has come under withering criticism from lawmakers over the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "The White House has said Biden is determined to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay before the end of his term.",
      "On Monday, the Pentagon said it had transferred 11 Yemeni men\u00a0to Oman this week who had been held without charge at Guant\u00e1namo for more than two decades. Their release brings the total number of remaining detainees at Guant\u00e1namo to 15, the fewest since 2002.",

      "His comments came after Trump on Tuesday declined to rule out military action or economic coercion in trying to claim Greenland. His remarks came in a media conference as his son Donald Trump Jr. visited Greenland's capital, Nuuk.",
      "Trump also said in a post on his Truth Social platform this week that \u201cGreenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation.\u201d",
      "Other senior European lawmakers took a similarly firm response to Scholz on Wednesday, even if they appeared to suggest that the threat of an American invasion of Danish territory was not credible.",

      "But, Barrot added, \u201cif you\u2019re asking me whether I think the United States will invade\u00a0Greenland, my answer is no.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit also pointed to the principles of the U.N. Charter and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe defense pact \u201cthat borders must not be moved by force.\u201d",
      "A mutual defense clause in the European Union treaty obliges all bloc members to render aid and assistance \u201cby all means of their power\u201d if any member is attacked.",
      "Experts say that Trump's unvarnished approach to foreign diplomacy, whether serious or not, may cause lasting damage.",

      "That said, \u201cthe simple fact is that Europe depends on the U.S. for the foreseeable future and it will have to live with Trump either way,\u201d he added.",
      "In that vein, European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said in a media conference Wednesday that the commission was \u201clooking forward to working towards a strong transatlantic agenda with the next U.S. administration.\u201d",
      "For its part, Denmark has taken a two-pronged approach to Trump's comments, reaffirming its political and economic commitment to Greenland on the one hand and seeking to downplay any rift with the incoming Trump administration on the other.",
      "Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the country\u2019s foreign minister,\u00a0said Wednesday that Trump\u2019s Arctic security concerns \u2014 one reason he cited for wanting to absorb Greenland \u2014 were legitimate in light of increased Chinese and Russian activity in the region,\u00a0and dismissed the idea that the issue had become a foreign policy crisis.",
      "Trump has been eyeing Greenland since his first term in office and last month told reporters that U.S. control of the vast Arctic island was a necessity for America\u2019s economic security, in part due to its strategic position and natural resource wealth.",
      "On Tuesday, he vowed to \u201ctariff Denmark at a very high level\u201d unless it gave up control of the territory.",
      "While Greenlandic Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede has long pushed for the territory's independence from Copenhagen \u2014 and Lokke Rasmussen on Wednesday left the door open for that possibility \u2014  he has in the past rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion of taking over the country he governs.",

      "Still, Denmark \u201cwants to avoid a public confrontation with Trump, which could hurt U.S.-Danish relations in the longer term,\u201d Rahbek-Clemmensen said.",

      "Over 400 people trapped by rubble in earthquake-stricken Tibet were rescued, officials in China said on Wednesday, with an unknown number still unaccounted for after a tremor rocked the Himalayan foothills and shifted the region\u2019s landscape.",
      "The epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s magnitude 6.8 quake, one of the region\u2019s most powerful tremors in recent years, was located in Tingri in China\u2019s Tibet, about 50 miles north of Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain. It also shook buildings in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and India.",
      "The quake was so strong that part of the terrain at and around the epicenter slipped as much as 5.2 feet over a distance of 50 miles, according to an analysis by the United States Geological Survey.",

He said later that he would not use military force against Canada, only \"economic force.\"",
      "\u201cThat would really be something,\u201d Trump said of the United States' taking control of Canada.",
      "\u201cYou get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great, but we\u2019re spending hundreds of billions here to protect it.\u201d Trump said that the subsidies include substantial military support and that the United States loses out through trade deficits.",
      "It\u2019s not immediately clear which funds Trump was referring to, but he has frequently complained about Canada and other NATO allies' not paying enough for defense spending. The United States and Canada also have a shared military alliance through North American Aerospace Defense Command.",
      "Trump on Tuesday night posted an image on Truth Social of the two countries with the U.S. flag emblazoned across them, writing, \u201cOh Canada!\u201d",

His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was on the ground Tuesday filming for a documentary accompanied by at least two incoming White House officials.",
      "\u201cWell, we need greater national security purposes. I\u2019ve been told that for a long time, long before I even ran,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cYou have approximately 45,000 people there. People really don\u2019t even know that Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security.\u201d He threatened to levy tariffs on Denmark at \"a very high level\" if it thwarted efforts by the Arctic island to seek independence or to join the United States.",
      "In a video posted to social media earlier in the day, Trump called into a lunch event on the island with Trump Jr.",

Trump claimed Panama has requested $3 billion from the United States help repair the canal, which slashes transport time between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, even as \u201cChina is basically taking it over.\u201d He has threatened to try to take it back and said returning it to U.S. control is \"vital\" to national security.",
      "While it is not clear what deal Trump was referring to, under the terms of a Carter administration treaty that transitioned control of the canal from the United States to Panama by 1999, the United States would hold the right to defend the canal from any change to its neutrality.",
      "\"We gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn\u2019t give it to China,\" Trump said. \"They\u2019ve abused that gift.\"",

      "\"What a beautiful name, and it\u2019s appropriate,\" said before he criticized Mexico for not doing enough to curb migration. \"Mexico has to stop allowing millions\u00a0of\u00a0people to pour into our country. They can stop them, and we\u2019re going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada, because Canada, they come through Canada, too.\"",

      "Since Trump won the election, a deluge of business leaders have visited his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as they seek to win favor with the incoming administration, among them Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Trump's inaugural committee has also received millions in donations from Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, Uber, Meta and some of their executives personally.",
      "Twenty mayors and community leaders in Pennsylvania and Indiana called on Biden to approve the deal in a letter late last month. On the opposite side, the United Steelworkers International union repeatedly pressed Biden to block the deal. It said last week said it had \"no doubt that it's the right move for our members and our national security,\" and it praised Biden's decision Friday.",
      "Burritt said any potential national security concerns about the agreement could be \u201ceasily mitigated.\u201d He said Biden had \u201ctainted\u201d the process by making it clear since the deal was announced that he would side with unions and didn't allow the review to \u201cplay out as it is supposed to.\u201d",
      "Burritt, the U.S. Steel chief, also dismissed Biden\u2019s concerns that the company needed to remain American-owned and -operated for national security and supply chain reasons. \u201cIn fact, it strengthens national security, it strengthens economic security, it strengthens job security. In fact, it grows the business,\u201d he said.",
      "Burritt declined to speculate on what would happen to U.S. Steel if the company\u2019s lawsuits or the incoming administration don\u2019t change the outcome. \u201cNobody in the integrated mill space is better than Nippon, and they\u2019re going to do great things for the workers here in Pennsylvania, in Indiana and all the places we do business.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel has said there is \u201cno reason to need to give up\u201d on its deal. \u201cThis is not just the most important matter for our company\u2019s business strategy. I am firmly convinced this is something extremely beneficial for both Japan and the United States,\u201d its chairman and CEO told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Both companies have emphasized in their lawsuits that \u201cnever before has a President prohibited an acquisition by a company based in Japan, one of our closest allies.\u201d"

      "So he started a project called Kings Punks, where he collected and distributed toys for children living on the street on Three Kings day, also known as Epiphany, when children in Mexico typically receive gifts from the three wise men.",
      "\u201cThe bases of punk are mutual support and solidarity,\u201d the 50-year-old said Sunday night as the gift drive was in full swing.",
      "Over the years many volunteers have joined his effort. Sporting black t-shirts from their favorite bands, black boots and glimmering piercings, the punks handed out scooters, dinosaurs and other gifts to children in the streets of Mexico\u2019s capital early Monday.",
      "\u201cDealing with children and the way you get attached and can be supportive to them \u2014 that is priceless,\u201d said Escobar, who is known locally as El Picos. \u201cAs we tell people: We don\u2019t want diplomas, recognition or anything.

But if the Danish king\u2019s latest move is anything to go by, the United States has a fight on its hands.",
      "King Frederik, who assumed the Danish throne after the abdication of Queen Margrethe II last year, has made a significant tweak to the royal coat of arms for the first time in more than 500 years, a move that was viewed by historians as a clear signal to Greenland \u2014 and perhaps Trump.",

    "story": [
      "Canadians woke up Tuesday to an uncertain future, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would resign and bring his near-decade in power to an end.",
      "Trudeau's announcement came just days into an election year and followed weeks of mounting pressure from within his own party to step down as he battled dire poll ratings partly driven by soaring inflation, rising immigration and his handling of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\"If I\u2019m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option\u201d in Canada's next election, Trudeau, 53, told reporters in Ottawa.",
      "His decision has triggered an urgent search within the Liberal Party to identify a new candidate who can take on Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Poilievre has dominated in the polls and was last on 44% according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, compared with Trudeau \u2014 whose rating sits just above 20%.",
      "The Trump factor",
      "A key focus for whoever leads Canada next will be managing their country\u2019s relationship with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "After winning re-election in November, the president-elect vowed to impose a 25% tariff on all products imported from Canada and Mexico.",
      "While Trudeau sought to appease Trump, visiting him at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the incoming president has since repeatedly jabbed at the prime minister, suggesting making Canada the 51st state and reiterating the idea in response to Trudeau\u2019s resignation.",
      "Trudeau's handling of Trump precipitated the final blow to his tenure, with the high-profile departure last month of his Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. In a scathing resignation letter, she accused Trudeau of failing to take seriously Trump\u2019s threats to increase import tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Freeland warned that Canada needed to take Trump\u2019s plans \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and avoid \u201ccostly political gimmicks.\u201d",
      "In contrast to Trudeau, Poilievre \u2014 the former-Conservative minister\u2019s biography touts him as a \u201clife-long conservative\u201d and \u201cchampion of a free market\u201d \u2014 has sought to present himself as the candidate with the \u201cstrength and smarts to stand up for this country.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CTV News last month, Poilievre said that his first message for the incoming president was \u201cthat first and foremost, Canada will never be the 51st state of the U.S.\u201d \u2014 and Canada, he said, had a \u201cvery proud future ahead of us.\u201d",
      "Tari Ajadi, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, was less sure. He told NBC News that Poilievre has yet to produce a clear plan on how to tackle the Canada-U.S. relationship under Trump, adding that \u201cI think Canada\u2019s in for a rough ride.\u201d",
      "What happens now?",
      "Even though Trudeau is quitting, Canadians will have to wait for months before they can head to the polls.",
      "An election date has yet to be announced, and while the Canada Elections Act says it must be held on or before Oct. 20, Trudeau's resignation means it's likely that a vote will be called before then.",
      "Before that can happen, the Liberal Party must find a candidate. Trudeau said he would remain at the party\u2019s helm until his party colleagues have undertaken a \"robust, nationwide, competitive process\" to find his successor.",
      "In the meantime, Trudeau said Canada's governor general had accepted his request to prorogue Parliament, suspending proceedings without the dissolution of parliament, until March 24. Then, a confidence vote is expected to be held, with a no-confidence result triggering the next federal election.",
      "That means the Liberal government will remain in power, but parliamentary activity will come to a halt.",
      "Referring to his party's lack of working majority and Canada's legislative gridlock, Trudeau said Monday that \u201cParliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history.\u201d",
      "Who will replace Trudeau?",
      "Trudeau, a former teacher who campaigned with the slogan \"sunny ways,\" took office in November 2015 and enjoyed high popularity ratings early in his leadership with the promise of liberal reforms, progressive tax policies and a focus on gender equality.",
      "His initial appeal was also boosted by the legacy of his father, the charismatic but polarizing Pierre Trudeau, who was one of Canada's longest-serving leaders.",
      "But in recent years, Trudeau's approval ratings plummeted from around 65% in September 2016 to around 22% in December, according to the nonprofit Angus Reid Institute.",
      "According to figures from the Angus Reid Institute, Freeland, a former journalist, is the Liberal candidate most likely to beat Poilievre.",
      "Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney is also a contender, and the Conservatives have sensed that. They have long attacked Carney, with Poilievre dismissing him as \"just like Justin.\"",
      "But regardless of who Trudeau's successor is, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine anyone coming in who can hold on to the government in the next election,\u201d Cornell University government professor Peter Loewen told NBC News.",
      "Dominic LeBlanc, minister of finance and intergovernmental affairs and a longtime friend of Trudeau's, and Foreign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly are also potential candidates.",
      "With Trudeau on his way out, the Liberal Party appears to face an existential crisis.",
      "\u201cTrudeau was a singular figure in Canadian politics,\u201d said Ajadi, of McGill University. \u201cThere\u2019s not another Justin Trudeau waiting in the wings.\u201d"

Le Pen had 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and antisemitic hate speech.",
