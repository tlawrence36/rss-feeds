      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Those assigned include the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry, the special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts.",
      "Recovering the jewels could be among the most difficult parts of investigators' work. French authorities have added the jewels to Interpol\u2019s Stolen Works of Art Database, a global repository of about 57,000 missing cultural items.",
      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",
      "But don\u2019t expect a flood of updates. Indictments and verdicts are not routinely made public in France. French trials are not televised, and journalists are not allowed to film or photograph anything inside the courtroom during a trial.",

      "June Lockhart, beloved for her roles in \u201cLassie\u201d and \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died at 100",
      "LOS ANGELES -- June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \u201cLassie\u201d or up in the stratosphere in \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died. She was 100.",
      "Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.",
      "\u201cShe was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\u201d",
      "The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.",
      "From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \u201cLassie.\u201d From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",
      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays \u201cSteel Magnolias,\u201d \u201cBedroom Farce\u201d and \u201cOnce More with Feeling.\u201d",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Popular Greek singer-songwriter Dionysis Savvopoulos was buried Saturday at Athens\u2019 First Cemetery in a state-sponsored funeral, four days after his death at age 80.",
      "Savvopoulos had died of a heart attack after battling cancer since 2020.",
      "Thousands came to pay their respects to a well-beloved, if sometimes controversial, artist as he lay in state at a chapel of the Athens Metropolitan Cathedral Saturday morning. Hundreds made the nearly 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) walk behind the hearse to the cemetery.",
      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

      "Savvopoulos never changed his musical style \u2014 a blend of rock, folk-rock, jazz and Greek popular music \u2014 to conform to mainstream tastes. Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks. A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",
      "Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the first of many who eulogized Savvopoulos during the funeral service, used the lyrics of the 1972 song \u201cMessenger Angel\" to portray the artist as a speaker of uncomfortable truths that many did not want to hear. \u201cIf he had no pleasant news to tell/better tell us none,\u201d he quoted the song's ending.",
      "Others who joined in eulogizing Savvopoulos were former President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, fellow musicians, artists and literary figures, some from his hometown of Thessaloniki, and one of his two grandsons.",

She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",

And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs. And honestly kind of opened up even more to my band mates and said, arrange. I want you guys to orchestrate this next era.",

And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical.

The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer.

      "Ballerina Misty Copeland has taken one last passionate spin on the ballet stage before saying goodbye",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late \u2014 at 13 \u2014 but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",
      "She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Hurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm, as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives.",
      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",
      "If possible, board up windows and place important documents such as passports and birth certificates in a waterproof case or even a Ziploc bag, Schulze said. That will prevent damage and make documents easier to locate in a quick evacuation.",
      "Mason recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.",
      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",
      "Hinote also urged people to review what type of insurance coverage they have and to make a home inventory of their possessions by taking photos of them in case an insurance claim needs to be made after a storm.",
      "\u201cIt is a lot of information and a lot of pre-storm steps but a little at a time,\u201d Hinote said.",
      "Every family should have an emergency kit with supplies to meet its basic needs.",
      "For people who stay, a kit should include at least 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person, with enough for up to seven days, Mason said. One way to have enough water is to fill a bathtub.",
      "People should also have enough nonperishable food for up to seven days, as well as flashlights, batteries, candles, medications, portable power banks or other power sources, and a radio that runs on batteries.",

      "Pets should be included in preparations, including bringing them inside ahead of a storm, and having enough food, water and necessary medications for up to seven days, Mason said.",
      "Parents should also include something to entertain their kids, such as games or coloring books, because likely power outages after a hurricane mean there won't be internet and cellular service, and there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u2019s more challenging for a family than kids that are bouncing off the walls because they\u2019re bored,\u201d Mason said.",
      "\u201cIf you decide to stay, you need to make sure that you can be self-sufficient for days to weeks, depending on how long it takes for power to be restored,\u201d Mason said.",
      "If people decide to leave ahead of a storm, they should also prepare an emergency kit with enough supplies to get to their destination, officials said.",
      "Before a storm arrives, people should know their evacuation routes are and have backup routes in case roads get congested, Mason said.",
      "Officials recommend fueling vehicles if a storm is approaching. People with electric vehicles should make sure their routes have charging stations along the way, he said.",
      "Schulze said it\u2019s natural for people to be afraid when a hurricane is coming, but having a plan in place and letting loved ones know you're prepared will go a long way to easing fears.",
      "\u201cThink about what the worst could be and prepare for that and you\u2019ll always be ready for what comes your way,\u201d Schulze said.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Moolenaar, who represents a district he handily won last year, responded: \u201cWe have time to negotiate, figure out a plan going forward and I think that\u2019s something that could occur.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have shown urgent concern. In a letter sent to Johnson, a group of 13 battleground House Republicans wrote that the party must \u201cimmediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of health care affordability\u201d once the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cWhile we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed.",
      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a big spending problem,\u201d McIntosh said.",
      "\u201cI think most people are going to say, OK, I had a great deal during COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s back to business as usual, and I should be paying for health care.\u201d",

      "While the percentage isn't surprising given the overall prevalence of so-called forever chemicals in the environment, officials said some residents living in the plume area showed dramatically higher concentrations than the broader testing group.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A major union announced a proposal Thursday to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires in California to address federal funding cuts to health care for low-income people.",
      "Proponents, including the Service Employees International Union, hope to place the statewide measure before voters next year. The tax would be on the net worth of California's richest residents. A small portion of the money would also help fund K-12 education since the federal government has threatened to withhold grant money from public schools.",
      "Backers of the measure sent a request to Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to get approval to start collecting signatures. The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.",
      "Proponents of the initiative said it was critical to backfill cuts to Medicaid because lives are at stake.",
      "\u201cIf we do not do this, millions of people are going to lose health care, an untold number of people will go without treatment and there will be tragedy after tragedy,\u201d said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.",
      "Billionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \u201cdesigned to make the State tax system more equitable.\u201d",
      "The big tax and spending cuts law President Donald Trump signed earlier this year will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid and federal food assistance.",

      "Being pregnant changes many of the processes that allow the body to stay cool during extreme heat",
      "Doctors have long known that heat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and other organs. Those risks are exacerbated for pregnant people, as the body's processes for staying cool are altered.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",
      "Here's what to know about the science of pregnancy and extreme heat:",
      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",
      "For pregnant people handling potent substances like pesticides, increased blood flow can also increase chemical absorption, said Dr. Chris Holstege, chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.",
      "Research is beginning to show exposure to extreme heat even in the months before getting pregnant may affect a future pregnancy, said Cara Schulte, a researcher with the University of California Berkeley and the nonprofit Climate Rights International studying maternal health and heat.",
      "During pregnancy, even short-term exposure to heat can increase the risk of severe maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, according to the EPA. That includes preeclampsia, a condition that can be fatal for both mother and child.",
      "Heat can also worsen anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation and once the baby is born, \u201call of those things are compounded by this difficulty that postpartum women have in caring for their children in the heat,\u201d Schulte said.",

      "The gales were worst in the lower North Island, where the capital Wellington is located, and in parts of the South Island, including the city of Christchurch. The national forecaster MetService issued rare \"red\" wind warnings, the highest level of alert, for several regions.",
      "No deaths or serious injuries were reported. When a different weather system battered the country on Monday, a Wellington man was struck and killed by a falling tree branch.",
      "The havoc on Thursday also disrupted planned rallies for health and education workers in what was likely the country's biggest industrial walkout in decades. More than 100,000 workers represented by four unions walked off the job for four hours, after months of talks with the government about pay and conditions broke down.",
      "More than 200 flights across New Zealand were canceled on Thursday as some urban parts of New Zealand experienced wind speeds of 140 to 160 km (87 to 100 miles) per hour, with gusts in one remote, rural part of the South Island registering 230 km (143 miles) per hour.",
      "Tens of thousands of properties were without power in different parts of the country. The winds downed trees, ripped off roofs, and in the city of Dunedin, toppled shipping containers at the port.",
      "Dangerous winds also forced the closure of some highways. The remote West Coast of the South Island was cut off by road after flooding closed the only routes to the area.",

      "In the days before the strike, ministers in New Zealand's center-right government \u2014 often at odds with workers' unions \u2014 lambasted the action as politically motivated. Union leaders rejected the charge, saying they had also enacted strikes during the previous center-left government.",
      "About half of those who walked off the job were teachers and the rest included doctors, dentists, nurses, social workers and other medical practitioners. Their demands varied between industries, but pay, staffing levels and working conditions were the central complaints prompting the strike.",
      "The action came amid steep government cuts to public spending and record numbers of New Zealanders leaving the country \u2014 particularly for neighboring Australia, where medical practitioners are lured by higher salaries and lower living costs.",
      "Several major highways remained closed on Thursday night and residents of some South Island regions remained on alert as rivers rose and threatened to breach their banks. Winds were due to ease by Friday, although the authorities urged caution for travelers.",
      "Bans on fireworks and fires were enacted for much of the country and would remain in place for the rest of the week, the national fire service said.

      "Lawyers for Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro have filed an appeal to reduce his prison sentence for attempting a coup after his 2022 electoral defeat",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Lawyers for Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro filed an appeal to reduce his prison sentence for attempting a coup after his 2022 electoral defeat.",
      "Judges in September convicted Bolsonaro of trying to overthrow democracy and sentenced him to 27 years and three months in jail. He has been under house arrest since August.",
      "In an 85-page document sent to the Supreme Court on Monday and shared with The Associated Press on Tuesday, lawyers said that the conviction and sentence entailed \u201cprofound injustices.\u201d",
      "Lawyers argued there were \u201cambiguities, omissions, contradictions and obscurities\u201d in the court\u2019s decision.",
      "Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing. He was convicted of attempting a coup after losing the 2022 race to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in a plot that prosecutors alleged included plans to kill Lula. He was found guilty on other charges including participating in an armed criminal organization and attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.",
      "In their appeal, lawyers argued Bolsonaro should not be convicted of both organising a coup and attempting to violently abolish democracy, on the grounds that the two charges overlap and therefore cumulative penalties are unjust.",
      "They also cited Justice Luiz Fux, who was the only dissenting vote on the five justice panel that convicted Bolsonaro, and argued that even if Bolsonaro had attempted a coup, he \u201cdeliberately interrupted the course of events\u201d and did not go through with it.",
      "Lawyers filed motions of clarification, which seek to correct a flaw in the reasoning of a decision rather than change it.",
      "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Padua, a law professor at the Fluminense Federal University, said that this kind of appeal is very unlikely to reduce Bolsonaro's sentence.",
      "To file an appeal that could substantially modify the decision, the Supreme Court usually requires at least two dissenting votes.",
      "There is no limit on how many motions for clarification can be filed, but the Supreme Court may deem successive filings an attempt to delay the final judgment.",

      "Seven other close aides were convicted alongside Bolsonaro, and all of them apart from Mauro Cid, who signed a plea deal, have filed appeals, the Supreme Court said in a statement on Tuesday.",

      "Bolsonaro will only start serving time once appeals are exhausted.",

      "That triggered a sharp deterioration in U.S.-Brazil relations, which experts described as the lowest point in their more than 200-year history.",
      "Relations have improved. Lula and Trump spoke on the phone then met last weekend in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit.",

      "Political parties in military-run Myanmar have kicked off their election campaigns two months ahead of scheduled national polls",
      "BANGKOK -- Political parties in military-run Myanmar on Tuesday kicked off their election campaigns, two months ahead of scheduled national polls that are widely seen as an effort to confer legitimacy on the military\u2019s 2021 seizure of power, even as the country\u2019s civil war precludes voting in many areas.",
      "Campaigning began just a day after U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian nations, warned that the planned election could cause further instability and deepen Myanmar\u2019s crisis.",
      "Critics of the military-led government charge that the polls, which are set to begin on Dec. 28, will be neither free nor fair.",
      "Fifty-seven parties have registered for the contest but Aung San Suu Kyi \u2019s National League for Democracy, which won the last two elections by landslides only to be ousted by the army, is not among them. It was one of dozens of parties ordered disbanded by the army-appointed Union Election Commission more than two years ago after it refused to take part in what it saw as a sham process.",
      "On Tuesday, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party held ceremonies in the capital Naypyitaw and Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, to unveil its campaign slogan \u201cStronger Myanmar.\u201d",
      "The ceremony in Naypyitaw, attended by hundreds of green-clad supporters, was led by the party\u2019s senior figures, including former generals now serving in the Cabinet of the military government.",
      "USDP chairman Khin Yi, a former general and chief of police, said in his speech that the campaign would follow regulations and the law, declaring that the poll\u2019s results would confer legitimacy.",

      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who heads the military government, has said that six parties will contest nationwide for seats. However, due to fighting, the polls cannot be held in all 330 townships, he said. Voting will be held in 102 townships in a first phase and 100 in the second.",
      "In the absence of the NLD or any other credible nationwide opposition parties, the military-backed USDP, which is fielding more than 1,000 candidates is expected to win the most seats.",
      "Several opposition organizations, including armed resistance groups, have said they will try to derail the polls. The General Strike Coordination Body, which organizes anti-military protests, announced on its Facebook page Monday that an election boycott would run from Tuesday until the end of the year and urged public participation.",
      "The military seized power in February 2021, claiming the victory of Suu Kyi\u2019s party in the November 2020 election was due to widespread voter fraud. However, they have failed to present convincing evidence to back the allegation.",
      "The takeover sparked a national uprising with fierce fighting in many parts of the country. The military government has stepped up activity ahead of the election to retake areas controlled by opposition forces, with airstrikes killing scores of civilians.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Dutch election for all 150 seats in the lower Second Chamber of parliament is forecast to be a close race between the shock winner of the last election, Geert Wilders' populist, anti-Islam Party for Freedom, and the center left bloc of the Labor Party and Green Left.",
      "Here is a glance at the leaders of those parties and other contenders in the Wednesday vote.",

      "Timmermans, 64, was thrust to international prominence when he gave an emotional speech to the United Nations Security Council shortly after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014.",
      "Born in the southern city of Maastricht, he served in the Dutch army and trained as an interrogator. He learned Russian during his service and is known for fluently speaking several languages.",
      "During the election campaign, his party filed a complaint with the police over fake, AI-generated images posted to a Facebook group showing Timmermans being arrested and taking money from a white man to give to a Muslim couple. The group was run by two members of Wilders' party who are standing in this week's election. Wilders apologized but did not announce any punishment for the pair.",

      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar, part of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, for decades but there is a new boom underway as global demand increases.",
      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",

      "The Associated Press spoke with five of the women, who described sometimes harsh working conditions in the manual labor. The vast majority of seaweed farmers work independently or in collectives, selling to local middlemen. There are few if any protections.",
      "Long days are spent wading under the equatorial sun. Back aches and skin irritation can result, with stings from sea urchins or other creatures being another worry.",
      "\u201cThere are health and safety challenges in this work,\u201d said Simai, an independent farmer who said she makes around $50 per month to help support her small family of two. The work may be more challenging for those with larger families, she said.",

      "A federal appeals court has overturned a landmark decision in an opioid lawsuit in West Virginia",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark decision in West Virginia that had rejected attempts by an opioid-ravaged area to be compensated by U.S. drug distributors for a influx of prescription pain pills into the region.",
      "The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that a lower court judge erred when he said West Virginia's public nuisance law did not apply to the lawsuit involving the distribution of opioids.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia law permits abatement of a public nuisance to include a requirement that a defendant pay money to fund efforts to eliminate the resulting harm to the public,\u201d the 4th Circuit wrote. \u201cWest Virginia has long characterized abatement as an equitable remedy.\u201d",
      "The ruling sends the case back to U.S. District Court in Charleston for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.\u201d",
      "Thousands of state and local governments have sued over the toll of opioids. The suits relied heavily on claims that the companies created a public nuisance by failing to monitor where the powerful prescriptions were ending up. Most of the lawsuits were settled as part of a series of nationwide deals that could be worth more than $50 billion. But there wasn\u2019t a decisive trend in the outcomes of those that have gone to trial.",
      "In July 2022, U.S. District Judge David Faber ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors who were accused by Cabell County and the city of Huntington of causing a public health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in the county. AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. also were accused of ignoring the signs that Cabell County was being ravaged by addiction.",
      "Faber said West Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court had only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids \u201cis inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.\u201d",
      "Last year the federal appeals court sent a certified question to the state Supreme Court, which states: \u201cUnder West Virginia\u2019s common law, can conditions caused by the distribution of a controlled substance constitute a public nuisance and, if so, what are the elements of such a public nuisance claim?\u201d",
      "The state justices declined to answer. That 3-2 opinion in May returned the case to the federal appears court.",

      "During arguments earlier this year before the state Supreme Court over the certified question, Steve Ruby, an attorney for the companies, called \u201cradical\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to extend the public nuisance law to opioid manufacturers. If allowed, he said, that would \u201ccreate an avalanche of activist litigation.\u201d",
      "The appeals court previously noted that the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel, which works to resolve complex cases in state court, has concluded in several instances that opioid distribution \u201ccan form the basis of a public nuisance claim under West Virginia common law.\u201d",
      "In his 2022 decision, Faber also said the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn\u2019t hold a proper registration from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.",
      "But the 4th Circuit Court found Tuesday that the lower court \u201cmisconstrued the distributors\u2019 duties\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act.",
      "The plaintiffs had sought more than $2.5 billion that would have gone toward opioid use prevention, treatment and education over 15 years.",

      "Flight delays are becoming more common across the country as more controllers call out sick because the Federal Aviation Administration was already so short on controllers before the shutdown.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association Nick Daniels have continued to emphasize the pressure that controllers are feeling. They say the problems are likely to only get worse the longer the shutdown continues.",
      "Not only are controllers worrying about how to pay for their mortgages and groceries, but Daniels said some of them are also grappling with how to pay for the medicine needed to keep their children alive. Duffy said he heard from one controller who had to tell his daughter she couldn't join the traveling volleyball team she had earned a spot on because he couldn't afford the cost during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cAir traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\u201d Daniels said Tuesday at a news conference alongside Duffy at LaGuardia Airport in New York. \u201cAnd I\u2019m watching air traffic controllers going to work. I\u2019m getting the stories. They\u2019re worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I\u2019m running out of money. And if she doesn\u2019t get the medicine she needs, she dies. That\u2019s the end.'\u201d",
      "The FAA restricts the number of flights landing and taking off at an airport anytime there is a shortage of controllers to ensure safety. Most of the time that has meant delays \u2014 sometimes hours long \u2014 at airports like New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport or Burbank airport in California. But over the weekend, Los Angeles International Airport actually had to stop all flights for nearly two hours.",
      "Controllers are planning to assemble outside at least 17 airports nationwide Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown as soon as possible. Worrying about how to pay their bills is driving some to take second jobs to make ends meet.",

      "The number of controllers calling in sick has increased during the shutdown both because of their frustration with the situation and because controllers need the time off to work second jobs instead of continuing to work six days a week like many of them routinely do. Duffy has said that controllers could be fired if they abuse their sick time, but the vast majority of them have continued to show up for work every day.",
      "Air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes in and out of airports in the New York area, said morale is suffering as controllers worry more about money.",
      "\u201cThe pressure is real,\u201d Segretto said. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe. We have trainees \u2014 that are trying to learn a new job that is very fast-paced, very stressful, very complex \u2014 now having to worry about how they\u2019re going to pay bills.\"",
      "Duffy said the shutdown is also making it harder for the government to reduce the longstanding shortage of about 3,000 controllers. He said that some students have dropped out of the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City, and younger controllers who are still training to do the job might abandon the career because they can't afford to go without pay.",
      "\u201cThis shutdown is making it harder for me to accomplish those goals,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The longer the shutdown continues, pressure will continue to build on Congress to reach an agreement to reopen the government. During the 35-day shutdown in President Donald Trump's first term the disruptions to flights across the country contributed to the end of that disruption. But so far, Democrats and Republicans have shown little sign of reaching a deal to fund the government.",

      "A California woman on trial for taking four chickens from one of Perdue Farms\u2019 major poultry plants has put animal treatment at slaughter houses in the national spotlight as the defense argues she rescued the birds from abuse",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A California animal rights activist on trial for taking four chickens from one of Perdue Farms' major poultry plants said Tuesday that she was rescuing Poppy, Ivy, Aster, and Azalea from abuse while prosecutors say she broke the law.",
      "Zoe Rosenberg, 23, faces more than five years in prison if convicted of a felony conspiracy charge and two misdemeanor counts of trespassing and a misdemeanor count of tampering with a vehicle.",
      "During the seven-week trial, her defense hasn\u2019t focused on if she took the chickens from Petaluma Poultry in 2023 that supplies chickens to Perdue Farms, one of the United States' largest poultry providers for major grocery chains \u2014 but rather the justification for doing so.",
      "Rosenberg testified she disguised herself as a Petaluma Poultry worker using a fake badge and earpiece, according to The Press Democrat, a newspaper in Santa Rosa where the trial is being held. She shared a videotape on social media that showed what she did. She said she was acting out of concern about animal cruelty, not as part of a criminal conspiracy.",
      "She said she was initially charged with theft but prosecutors dropped the charge because it would have meant telling the jury the chickens were worth $24 and were sick.",
      "\u201cThese chickens were incredibly ill and they needed care and I think that when an animal is in distress, when an animal is being abused and the authorities aren\u2019t stepping in, and they aren\u2019t helping those animals that we do have the legal right to help them ourselves,\" Rosenberg told The Associated Press in an interview before Tuesday's closing arguments in the trial.",
      "\u201cMy intent was to help animals and to do so legally, not to break the law,\" she added.",
      "Kevin Little, one of Rosenberg\u2019s lawyers, told the court when the trial began that \u201cthis is not a whodunit. This is a why-dunit.\"",
      "Prosecutors argue that what she did was illegal.",
      "Perdue has said Rosenberg and her organization Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE, is an extremist group that is intent on destroying the animal agriculture industry. They say the animals were not mistreated.",
      "DxE is known for animal rescues and protests that often garner national attention. Prosecutors say Rosenberg entered Petaluma Poultry without authorization four times and attached GPS devices to 12 delivery vehicles before taking the chickens from a trailer and leaving with them, while about 50 DxE members demonstrated outside, the Press Democrat reported.",
      "Rosenberg's lawyers said she spent months looking into the alleged abuse and she consulted a veterinarian who was concerned about images that appeared to show animals being boiled alive. One of her attorneys, Chris Carraway, said in a statement that this \u201cwas a rescue, not a crime.\u201d",
      "In recent years, similar cases involving animal rights activists have gone to court with mixed results in front of juries across the U.S. But in California's Sonoma County, where agriculture is one of the main industries, Rosenberg faces an especially uphill battle.",
      "Sonoma County just two years ago successfully prosecuted DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung for his role in two factory farm protests in Petaluma. Hsiung was sentenced to 90 days in jail and two years of probation, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The county is believed to have prosecuted more cases against animal rights activists than any other in the country.",

He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it\u2019s instead time for a \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.",
      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world\u2019s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries.",

      "Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his \u201ctough truths about climate\u201d memo will be controversial.",
      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",

Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.",
      "At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States and China are not going to resolve all the issues that divide them before presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet Thursday in Busan, South Korea.",
      "But they are likely to make enough progress on China\u2019s stranglehold on strategic minerals, American export controls and other nettlesome problems to calm financial markets and prevent their rivalry from doing much more economic damage for now.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get to some kind of d\u00e9tente,\u201d said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. trade official and diplomat who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. \u201cThere\u2019s no pretense that they\u2019re going to reach a grand bargain that solves everything in the relationship.\u2019\u2019",
      "The two countries sent out reassuring signals over the weekend that an agreement was drawing closer.",
      "China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that Washington and Beijing had reached a \u201cpreliminary consensus.\u201d Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was \u201ca very successful framework.\u201d",
      "Trump himself expressed confidence, saying Chinese officials \u201cwant to make a deal and we want to make a deal.\u201d",
      "Before the talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, over the weekend, U.S. and Chinese negotiators had previously met four times this year \u2014 in Geneva in May, London in June, Stockholm in July and Madrid in September \u2014 but had only managed to reach a truce to avoid escalating tariffs and a vague deal \u201cframework,\u201d not anything of substance.",
      "When new tensions rose earlier this month, Trump had been threatening to slap another 100% tariff on Chinese products Nov. 1 \u2014 on top of an already-high 57.6%, according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "But in a sign the two countries are making progress, Bessent said Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u2019\u2019 that those punishing triple-digit levies are \u201ceffectively off the table\u2019\u2019 as talks continue.",
      "Here are some of the areas of contention between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "China is the world\u2019s leading producer and processor of rare-earth minerals and related technologies critical for fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and a host of other high-tech products. In a show of strength and of the leverage it brings to the negotiating table, the country has limited exports of the elements, crippling U.S. and other foreign companies. Most recently, they tightened the restrictions Oct. 9, just ahead of the Trump-Xi summit.",
      "\u201cRare earths are now the most effective lever that China can pull,\u201d said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe rest of the world does not have readily available or affordable productive capacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "The United States and other countries are investing heavily in rare earths to break China\u2019s domination but it may take years for that to pay off. \u201cThey realize this is not a lever they can pull forever,\u2019\u2019 Liu said. \u201cSo they want to use it when it actually hurts.\u2019\u2019",
      "Bessent said Sunday on ABC that he expected China to \u201cdelay\u2019\u2019 the rare earth export controls \u201cfor a year while they reexamine it.\u2019\u2019",
      "Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said the threat of more Chinese restrictions on rare earths will always be hanging over America\u2019s head until a new supply is developed. \u201cThe United States must urgently build independent critical minerals supply chains,\u201d Althaus said.",
      "Rare earths aren\u2019t the only leverage China has. American farmers \u2014 among Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters \u2014 have traditionally depended on China to buy about a quarter of the soybeans they produce. But China has stopped buying American soybeans this year, choosing to use Brazilian and Argentinian suppliers instead.",
      "On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker\u2019\u2019 Sunday, Bessent, who owns soybean farmland himself, suggested that relief might be coming to the American heartland. \u201cWe are going to be able to discuss substantial soybean and ag purchases for American farmers,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

      "\u201cNothing would really discourage farmers more if there\u2019s some very ambitious announcement, but then nothing ends up transpiring,\u201d he said.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, asked how much appetite China actually has for American soybeans after buying so much from Brazil and Argentina. Still, Beijing would be \u201cwilling to restart some U.S. purchases as a goodwill gesture, even if doing so requires building stockpiles beyond normal levels,\u201d Wildau wrote.",

      "Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department issued a new rule to drastically extend export restrictions not only to previously blacklisted foreign companies but to affiliates in which they own stakes of at least 50%.",
      "Jeffrey Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, says the rule will be \u201cclosing the loopholes and ensuring that export controls work as intended.\u201d China immediately protested, calling it another \u201ctypical case\u201d of the U.S. broadening national security and abusing export control. The Chinese Commerce Ministry says the act is \u201cextremely bad\u201d and will \u201cseverely harm the legitimate interests of companies.\u201d",
      "Ted Murphy, a trade lawyer with Sidley Austin, wrote in a commentary that the U.S. might relax the restrictions, the way China is expected to ease up on its rare-earth controls. \u201cPresident Trump is in \u2018deal mode' and is unlikely to let the opportunity of meeting with President Xi in person get away without a deal.\u2019\u2019",
      "Still, Bessent told \u201cFace the Nation'' that \u201dthere have been no, no changes in our export controls.''",
      "In February, Trump slapped a 10% tax on Chinese imports to pressure Beijing to do more to stop the flow of chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl. He doubled it a month later. For months, Beijing has been frustrated over lack of progress in working out a deal to end the fentanyl tariffs. A senior Chinese public security official once traveled to one of the trade talks but there was no U.S. counterpart to meet him.",
      "Chinese officials had expressed exasperation that the Trump administration failed to recognize steps Beijing took in the last year of the Biden administration to address drug trafficking. They are also confounded because the Trump administration hasn't been clear about what it wants Beijing to do. China has retaliated by levying a new 10% or 15% tariff on many U.S. farm goods, including soybeans.",
      "Bessent said Sunday that discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals from coming into the U.S., raising hopes that the U.S. will consider at least reducing the fentanyl tariffs.",
      "Whatever progress the two countries make on specific issues, Moon said, bigger problems remain.",
      "The toughest is that China has decided to pull itself out of an economic rut caused by the collapse of its housing market by cranking out factory production and flooding the world with low-priced products.",
      "But the United States and other wealthy countries are determined \u201cnot to let Chinese overcapacity hollow out their industries and destroy their industrial base. Those are totally inconsistent trends,\u2019\u2019 Moon said. \u201cBoth countries are deeply committed to them. And for that reason, I don\u2019t see an end in sight.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t decouple. There are things that we both need from each other.... If you continue trying to damage the other side with no end in sight, then both sides die the death of a thousand cuts.\"",

      "The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year.

      "Trump's goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell's status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed's board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years.",

But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point.",
      "Michelle Bowman is the Fed's vice chair of supervision, making her the nation's top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas' state bank commissioner.

      "The Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut its key interest rate on Wednesday and could signal it expects another cut in December as the central bank seeks to bolster hiring",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut its key interest rate on Wednesday and could signal it expects another cut in December as the central bank seeks to bolster hiring.",
      "A cut Wednesday would be the second this year and could benefit consumers by bringing down borrowing costs for mortgages and auto loans. Since Fed chair Jerome Powell strongly signaled in late August that rate cuts were likely this year, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to about 6.2% from 6.6%, providing a boost to the otherwise-sluggish housing market.",
      "Still, the Fed is navigating an unusual period for the U.S. economy and its future moves are harder to anticipate than is typically the case. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, yet inflation remains elevated, and the economy's mostly solid growth is heavily dependent on massive investment by leading tech companies in artificial intelligence infrastructure.",
      "The central bank is assessing these trends without most of the government data it uses to gauge the economy's health. The release of September's jobs report has been postponed because of the government shutdown. The White House said last week October's inflation figure may not even be compiled.",
      "The shutdown itself may also crimp the economy in the coming months, depending on how long it lasts. Roughly 750,000 federal workers are nearing a month without pay, which could soon start weakening consumer spending, a critical driver of the economy.",
      "Federal workers laid off by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency efforts earlier this year may formally show up in jobs data if it is reported next month, which could make the monthly hiring data look even worse.",
      "Powell has said that the risk of weaker hiring is rising, which makes it as much of a concern as still-elevated inflation. As a result, the central bank needs to move its key rate closer to a level that would neither slow nor stimulate the economy.",
      "Most Fed officials view the current level of its key rate \u2014 4.1% \u2014 as high enough to slow growth and cool inflation, which has been their main goal since price increases spiked to a four-decade high three years ago. The Fed is widely expected to reduce it to about 3.9% Wednesday. WIth job gains at risk, the goal is to move rates to a less-restrictive level.",
      "Kris Dawsey, head of economic research at D.E. Shaw, an investment bank, said that the lack of data during the shutdown means the Fed will likely stay on the path it sketched out in September, when it forecast cuts this month and in December.",
      "\u201cImagine you\u2019re driving in a winter storm and suddenly lose visibility in whiteout conditions,\" Dawsey said. \"While you slow the car down, you\u2019re going to continue going in the direction you were going versus making an abrupt change once you lose that visibility.\u201d",
      "In recent remarks, the Fed chair has made clear that the sluggish job market has become a signficant concern.",
      "\u201cThe labor market has actually softened pretty considerably,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\u201d",
      "Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data Oct. 1, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July.",

      "The uncertainty has prompted some top Fed officials to suggest that they may not necessarily support a cut at its next meeting in December. At its September meeting, the Fed signaled it would cut three times this year, though its policymaking committee is divided. Nine of 19 officials supported two or fewer reductions.",
      "Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board and one of five people being considered by the Trump administration to replace Powell as Fed chair next year, said in a recent speech that while hiring data is weak, other figures suggest the economy is growing at a healthy pace.",

      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",

      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep.

      "Efforts to back fill some of the cuts to U.S. foreign aid by the Trump administration raised over $125 million in eight months",
      "NEW YORK -- When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how to continue critical aid programs that could be funded by private donors.",
      "Multiple groups launched fundraisers in February and eventually, these emergency funds mobilized more than $125 million within eight months, a sum that while not nearly enough, was more than the organizers had ever imagined possible.",
      "In those early days, even with needs piling up, wealthy donors and private foundations grappled with how to respond. Of the thousands of programs the U.S. funded abroad, which ones could be saved and which would have the biggest impact if they continued?",
      "\u201cWe were fortunate enough to be in connection with and communication with some very strategic donors who understood quickly that the right answer for them was actually an answer for the field,\u201d said Sasha Gallant, who led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that specialized in identifying programs that were both cost effective and impactful.",
      "Members of Gallant's team, some of whom had been fired and others working outside of business hours, pulled together a list that eventually included 80 programs they recommended to private donors. In September, Project Resource Optimization, as their effort came to be called, announced all of the programs had been funded, with more than $110 million mobilized in charitable grants. Other emergency funds raised at least an additional $15 million.",
      "Those funds are just the most visible that private donors mobilized in response to the unprecedented withdrawal of U.S. foreign aid. It's possible private foundations and individual donors gave much more, but those gifts won't be reported for many months.",
      "For the Trump administration, the closure of USAID was a cause for celebration. In July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency had little to show for itself since the end of the Cold War.",
      "\u201cDevelopment objectives have rarely been met, instability has often worsened, and anti-American sentiment has only grown,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Going forward, Rubio said the State Department will focus on providing trade and investment, not aid, and will negotiate agreements directly with countries, minimizing the involvement of nonprofits and contractors.",
      "Some private donations came from foundations, who decided to grant out more this year than they had planned and were willing to do so because they trusted PRO's analysis, Gallant said. For example, the grantmaker GiveWell said it gave out $34 million it otherwise would not have to directly respond to the aid cuts, including $1.9 million to a program recommended by PRO.",
      "Others were new donors, like Jacob and Annie Ma-Weaver, a San Francisco-based couple in their late-thirties who, through their work at a hedge fund and a major tech company respectively, had earned enough that they planned to eventually give away significant sums. Jacob Ma-Weaver said the U.S. aid cuts caused needless deaths and were shocking, but he also saw in the moment a chance to make a big difference.",
      "\"It was an opportunity for us and one that I think motivated us to accelerate our lifetime giving plans, which were very vague and amorphous, into something tangible that we could do right now,\u201d he said.",
      "The Ma-Weavers gave more than $1 million to projects selected by PRO and decided to speak publicly about their giving to encourage others to join them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually very uncomfortable in our society \u2014maybe it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 to tell the world that you\u2019re giving away money,\u201d Jacob Ma-Weaver said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this embarrassment of riches about it, quite literally.\u201d",
      "The funds that PRO mobilized did not backfill USAID's grants dollar for dollar. Instead, PRO's team worked with the implementing organizations to pare down their budgets to only the most essential parts of the most impactful projects.",
      "For example, Helen Keller Intl ran multiple USAID-funded programs providing nutrition and treatment for neglected tropical diseases. All of those programs were eventually terminated, taking away almost a third of Helen Keller's overall revenue.",

      "Shawn Baker, an executive vice president at Helen Keller, said as soon as it became clear that the U.S. funding was not coming back, they started to triage their programming. When PRO contacted them, he said they were able to provide a much smaller budget for private funders. Instead of the $7 million annual budget for a nutrition program in Nigeria, they proposed $1.5 million to keep it running.",
      "Another nonprofit, Village Enterprise, received $1.3 million through PRO. But they were also able to raise $2 million from their own donors through a special fundraising appeal and drew on an unrestricted $7 million gift from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott that they\u2019d received in 2023. The flexible funding allowed them to sustain their most essential programming during what CEO Dianne Calvi called seven months of uncertainty.",
      "That many organizations managed to hold on and keep programs running, even after significant funding cuts, was a surprise to the researchers at PRO. Since February, the small staff supporting PRO have extended their commitment to the project one month at a time, expecting that either donations would dry up or projects would no longer be viable.",
      "\u201cThat time that we were able to buy has been absolutely invaluable in our ability to reach more people who are interested in stepping in,\u201d said Rob Rosenbaum, the team lead at PRO and a former USAID employee. He said they have taken a lot of pride in mobilizing donors who have not previously given to these causes.",
      "\u201cTo be able to convince somebody who might otherwise not spend this money at all or sit on it to move it into this field right now, that is the most important dollar that we can move,\u201d he said.",
      "Not all private donors were eager to jump into the chasm created by the U.S. foreign aid cuts, which happened without any \u201crhyme or reason,\" said Dean Karlan, the chief economist at USAID when the Trump administration took over in January.",
      "Despite the extraordinary mobilization of resources by some private funders, Karlan said, \u201cYou have to realize there\u2019s also a fair amount of reluctance, rightly so, to clean up a mess that creates a moral hazard problem.\"",
      "The uncertainty about what the U.S. will fund going forward is likely to continue for some time. The emergency funds offered a short term response from interested private funders, many of whom are now trying to support the development of whatever comes next.",
      "For Karlan, who is now a professor of economics at Northwestern University, it is painful to see the consequences of the aid cuts on recipient populations. He also resents the attacks on the motivations of aid workers in general.",
      "Nonetheless, he said many in the field want to see the administration rebuild a system that is efficient and targeted. But Karlan said, he hasn't yet seen any steps, \u201cthat give us a glimpse of how serious they\u2019re going to be in terms of actually spending money effectively.\u201d",

      "Mikaela Shiffrin was even more alert to the potential dangers of training courses when the American star started skiing again after her terrifying crash last year",
      "When Mikaela Shiffrin started skiing again weeks after her terrifying crash last year, the American star was even more alert to the potential dangers of training courses.",
      "Shiffrin's injuries \u2014 puncture wound to her abdomen and severe damage to her abdominal muscles \u2014 came in a World Cup giant slalom race but the two-time Olympic champion knew that training could be just as risky.",
      "If not more.",
      "\u201cWhen I came back from injury I was aware of the fencing on the side and a hole in the course and where the trees were,\u201d Shiffrin told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cWe are often training in conditions where the variables are just too many to control and you have to decide sometimes: Is this unreasonably dangerous or is this within a reasonable level of danger that we need to train, we need to practice, and this is the only way we can do it?\u201d",
      "French skier Alexis Pinturault had similar experiences.",
      "\u201cWe are training in many places where it\u2019s not really safe, yes, that\u2019s 100% sure,\u201d the 2021 men\u2019s overall World Cup champion said.",
      "Ongoing safety discussions in Alpine skiing came into fresh focus in September, less than five months before the Milan-Cortina Olympics, when World Cup racer Matteo Franzoso died following a crash in preseason training in Chile.",
      "The 25-year-old Italian crashed through two layers of safety fencing on a course at La Parva and slammed into a wooden fence positioned six to seven meters outside the course. He died two days later from cranial trauma and a consequent swelling of his brain.",
      "Franzoso was the third young Italian skier to die in less than a year, and a talented French skier died following a training crash in April.",
      "Shiffrin, a five-time overall champion and winner of a record 101 World Cup races, dealt with lingering post-traumatic stress disorder when she got back on skis again after her injuries.",
      "Nearly three months after her crash, she returned to racing in late February.",
      "\u201cAthletes and coaches and everybody are so used to saying that the sport carries an inherent risk that you start to become blind to some of the risks that are actually life-threatening,\u201d Shiffrin said.",
      "\u201cThis was a challenge for me, that I felt so scared of the risk for the rest of the season. If you think too much about it you become paralyzed. But it\u2019s really important that we can assess what those risks are and try to find ways to mitigate that as much as possible. It\u2019s not OK to say risk is part of the sport and you take it or leave it.\u201d",
      "The issue with training courses is that, for financial reasons, they usually lack the same safety standards that apply to race courses.",
      "Smaller crews of course workers are on the hill to maintain the condition of the snow surface; fewer safety netting is placed along the course to break the fall when racers crash; and less medical staff and equipment, like helicopters for immediate transport to a hospital, are available.",
      "Sofia Goggia, the 2018 Olympic downhill champion, called ski racing \u201can extreme sport. At a high level, it\u2019s like F1 or MotoGP in downhill, super-G, but also giant slalom, because the speed is 80-90 kph (50-56 mph), the risk is there every time.\u201d",
      "In races, courses are safer thanks an abundance of nets, according to the Italian, but she pointed out that just having more nets won\u2019t solve the issues on training courses.",
      "When there is overnight snowfall safety netting should be removed, the slope cleaned from the fresh snow, and the netting put back before skiers can charge down in the early morning hours.",
      "While this is an obvious procedure for local organizers and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on a race day, the question is who takes care of it during a preseason training camp?",
      "For Goggia, it would be wrong to point the finger at just the team coaches, who cannot be held responsible \u201cbecause a coach just teaches you how to ski.\u201d",

      "She recalled the day of Franzoso\u2019s crash in September, when there were three teams training on that slope: Austria, Switzerland and Italy.",
      "\u201cI cannot think that they didn\u2019t see the danger, maybe,\u201d Goggia said. \u201cBut if you want to ensure the training slope as a World Cup slope, there has to be a totally different organization. The answer is easy: We can do more. But who does it in the end? Who wants to invest millions of euros?\u201d",
      "After the Franzoso tragedy, the Italian Winter Sports Federation called on FIS to establish dedicated training courses, both in the southern hemisphere in countries like Chile, Argentina and New Zealand, as well as in the U.S. and Europe, with safety netting just like courses used for World Cup races.",
      "On the fringe of the World Cup season-opening races in Austria last weekend, FIS President Johan Eliasch said the governing body was working to \u201cprevent as much as possible horrible accidents to happen.\u201d",
      "Together with national federations and local organizers, FIS was looking into improving safety, from scheduling a race calendar that allows skiers to take more rest to having more medical staff on the ground, and from placing more netting to better preparing the snow surface of courses.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure that when you have training runs in speed that the safety standards are exactly the same as on the big race day,\u201d Eliasch said.",
      "However, that might be too ambitious, Austria women\u2019s team coach Roland Assinger said.",
      "\u201cA risk will always remain but we coaches try to minimize it,\u201d said Assinger, a former World Cup downhiller.",
      "\u201cCopper Mountain (in Colorado) is the safest training course in the world, with A netting from top to bottom and countless B nets. In South America, they also have a lot of B nets, but not at the same level, as it\u2019s financially not doable to invest those millions.\u201d",
      "The Austrian federation started this summer, even before Franzoso's death, to ship additional safety netting to their overseas training camps.",
      "\u201cWas it enough? It was a first step,\" Christian Scherer, secretary general of Ski Austria, said. \u201cBut we need a coordinated approach from the national federations.\u201d",
      "Scherer added the responsibility for safer training courses cannot be left to the local ski resorts.",
      "That's the question. Asked by the AP, Eliasch said FIS distributed \u201cnearly 100 million\u201d over the past four years to its member federations \u201cso they have the resources.\u201d",
      "Eliasch added the leading nations such as Austria and Switzerland \u201chave so much money\u201d that they could invest more in the safety of training courses.",
      "\u201cFor a smaller (federation), this can be a challenge. Here we do step in and help,\u201d Eliasch said.",
      "Austrian speed specialist Vincent Kriechmayr, a former world champion in downhill and super-G, hoped \u201cthat the big federations cooperate and coordinate a little bit better in regions where all nations train.\u201d",
      "Assinger called it \u201ccertainly a good idea\u201d for FIS to support some venues which accommodate teams for offseason training camps.",
      "\u201cBut if it happens? I will see next summer,\u201d the Austrian coach said. \u201cSo far, it has only been talking.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The World Series Late Show was so good the Dodgers produced a sequel: The Late, Late Sho.",
      "Seven years and one day after outlasting the Boston Red Sox over 18 innings in Game 3, Los Angeles did it again, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 Monday night on Freddy Freeman's 18th-inning home run off Brendon Little to take a two games to one lead in the best-of-seven matchup.",
      "Dodgers rookie reliever Justin Wrobleski, having gotten five outs in the sixth and seventh innings, was astonished at what he saw.",
      "\u201cI look up at the scoreboard and the innings that I pitch are no longer on the scoreboard,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the craziest thing.\u201d",
      "Shohei Ohtani, used to a dual life as a batter and pitcher, had what amounted to a double game at the plate. He homered twice and doubled twice in the first four-extra-base-hit Series game since Frank Isbell in 1906.",
      "He then walked five times, four of them intentionally \u2014 three times with no one on base. He tied the record of reaching base nine times. He even stayed in the game after being stricken by a leg cramp while he was caught stealing in the ninth inning.",
      "\u201cAnd he\u2019s got to pitch in like, I don\u2019t know, 12 hours, 13 hours,\u201d Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw marveled.",
      "A night to remember saw 609 pitches thrown over 6 hours, 39 minutes. Forty-four players appeared, including 19 pitchers. The Dodgers outhit the Blue Jays 16-15 in a game that included a 10-inning double shutout \u2014 no runs were scored from innings eight through 17. Los Angeles went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 18 runners, and Toronto was 2 for 12 RISP with 19 left on base.",
      "\u201cIt takes everybody to win a World Series,\u201d said the Dodgers' Max Muncy, who hit the winning 18th-inning homer against Nathan Eovaldi in 2018 \u2014 the only LA win in that Series.",
      "In an array of defense gems, right fielder Addison Barger cut down Freeman at the plate with a 98.5 mph missile, Toronto first baseman Vladimir Guerrero threw out Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez at third with an 87.6 mph rocket, Dodgers second baseman Tommy Edman gunned down Isiah Kiner-Falefa from short right field and Hern\u00e1ndez relayed to Edman to throw out Davis Schneider at the plate.",
      "\u201cCrazy, crazy, crazy, crazy game,\u201d Toronto starter Max Scherzer said.",
      "Sandy Koufax, a three-time World Series champion two months shy of his 90th birthday, stayed until the end.",
      "A three-time Cy Young Award winner who plans to retire after the Series, Kershaw came out of the bullpen with the bases loaded in the 12th inning to Fun's \u201cWe Are Young,\u201d in what the 37-year-old left-hander thought was his first extra-innings outing at any level. Nathan Lukes fouled off Kershaw\u2019s second full-count pitch, a 91.9 mph offering that was his fastest since July 31, 2024, then grounded to second.",
      "\u201cI throw gas now,\u201d Kershaw said, laughing.",
      "Kershaw had \u201c51\u201d written on his cap like other Dodgers relievers in a tribute to Alex Vesia, who is missing the Series because of what the team said was a \u201cdeeply personal family matter.\u201d",

Yamamoto was warming up while Klein pitched the 18th.",

      "Second baseman Miguel Rojas, who made four mop-up appearances during the season, entered the game as a pinch hitter in the 13th and realized a few innings later he might be called on to pitch on 115 days' rest and become the first position player to take the mound in a World Series.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers two-way phenomenon has shown off his baseball magnificence during this year's MLB postseason, particularly on Oct. 17, when he had arguably the greatest performance in the game's history, hitting three home runs at the plate while striking out 10 on the mound in an NL Championship Series-clinching win over the Milwaukee Brewers.",
      "He made more history Monday, homering twice and tying a 119-year-old major league record with four extra-base hits in a wild, 18-inning victory over Toronto in Game 3 of the World Series. Ohtani also drew five consecutive walks, making him the first major leaguer in 83 years to reach base nine times in any game, let alone the postseason.",
      "That instant classic ended about 17 hours before Ohtani was slated to bring his two-way show to the World Series. He'll pitch and bat leadoff in Game 4 on Tuesday night, his first time taking the mound in the Fall Classic.",
      "Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is among standouts in other sports who are in awe of someone transcending what many thought was possible on a baseball diamond.",
      "Mahomes has some added perspective on baseball \u2014 his dad, Pat, was a big-league pitcher from 1992 to 2003.",
      "\u201cTo be able to be that dominant pitching the ball, throwing 100, and then going and hitting home runs and changing the outcome of the game \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like it was a blowout, like every home run was needed,\u201d Mahomes said of NLCS Game 4. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable. And, like, he\u2019s top at both sides of the ball. He\u2019s one of the best pitchers in the league, also if not the best, one of the best hitters in the league \u2013 top two, with him and (Aaron) Judge.\u201d",
      "Houston Rockets forward Kevin Durant \u2014 a 15-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP who is among basketball\u2019s all-time great scorers \u2014 says he\u2019s also a fan.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a freak of nature,\u201d Durant said. \u201cHe\u2019s changing sports in general. It\u2019s kind of crazy, this era of players, so many unique players in every sport. It\u2019s just incredible to be watching sports and Shohei is one of those guys who\u2019s going to be a legend, one of the greatest all time, arguably the greatest of all time when he\u2019s done playing.\u201d",
      "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has some experience as an athletic anomaly, playing nine MLB seasons while also embarking on a Hall of Fame football career. The confident 58-year-old \u2014 known as \u2018Coach Prime\u2019 these days \u2014 also has some experience on what makes a celebrity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s great. He\u2019s not good, he is great,\" Sanders said. \"You hate to say once in a lifetime, but it\u2019ll be decades before another player comes along like that.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has shown a knack for showing up in big moments throughout his career. He had a three-homer, two-steal game while becoming the first player to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases in a season in 2024. Earlier this year, the Japanese star hit a towering solo homer in his return to the Tokyo Dome, delighting his home country.",
      "Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said Ohtani doesn't really have any peers in the sporting world. He agreed that the three-homer, 10-strikeout game would be like an NFL quarterback throwing four touchdowns in a game and then also playing safety and grabbing two interceptions on defense in the playoffs.",

      "The NFL\u2019s International Player Pathway program gives players from outside the United States and Canada a chance to learn, develop, practice and play American football professionally as the league continues to expand its global reach",
      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Leander Wiegand knew very little about the NFL \u2014 or American football, for that matter \u2014 when his best friend urged him to check out something he saw on TV.",
      "It was the day after the Super Bowl in February 2016 and Wiegand\u2019s buddy Kolja turned on a replay of Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos beating Cam Newton's Carolina Panthers.",
      "The teens, sitting on a couch in Aachen, Germany, spent the next few hours mesmerized.",
      "\u201cWe just thought Cam Newton was super cool, like, with the Superman pose and everything,\u201d a smiling Wiegand recalled. \u201cBut yeah, that was the first football experience for me, my first time seeing football.\u201d",
      "That game sparked a winding journey that led the native of Germany to the New York Jets this season.",
      "Wiegand, now a 26-year-old offensive lineman on the Jets' practice squad, is part of the NFL\u2019s International Player Pathway (IPP) program, which gives players from outside the United States and Canada a chance to learn, develop, practice and play the game professionally as the league expands its global reach.",
      "\u201cThe IPP has absolutely changed my life,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cThey gave me the opportunity to be seen. When you grow up in America and you play American football and you\u2019re really good, there\u2019s pretty much no way around you. Like, if you play good in high school, colleges will recruit you. You play good in college, NFL teams will see you.",
      "\u201cBut when you come from different parts of the world, it\u2019s sometimes tough to be seen.\u201d",
      "That's where the IPP program comes in, shining a light on athletes from all over the world for NFL teams.",
      "\u201cI think it was Kyle Brandt or someone on the (NFL) Network, so I can\u2019t take credit for this, but they describe this program as like the Avengers,\u201d said Pat Long, the NFL's director of international football development. \"The IPP is the Avengers because these are the outliers. These are the athletes that you don\u2019t just find.\u201d",
      "The initiative was started by the league in 2017 to identify outstanding international athletes in various sports and give them a chance to improve their American football skills and possibly earn a spot on a roster.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s kind of a two-part intention to it,\u201d Long said. \u201cOne is to provide a direct pathway for elite talent, wherever that may be found around the world, to have the opportunity to advance on into the NFL, obviously not without some intensive training and development along the way.",
      "\"It also serves a second marketing element and, as we grow and develop these local heroes from their respective countries, that has an impact in terms of moving the needle for those fan bases in those countries.\"",
      "Since the program's inception, nearly 100 international players have participated and more than 40 have signed with NFL teams.",
      "Players can be drafted, if eligible, by NFL teams or signed as free agents. Each team is allowed one roster exemption for an international player during the offseason and that player can fill a 17th roster spot on their practice squads \u2014 rather than the usual 16-player limit \u2014 in the regular season.",
      "Philadelphia offensive lineman Jordan Mailata is roundly recognized as the face of the program, a former rugby league star in Australia who tried out in 2018.",
      "\u201cWe hopped on a plane, worked out and they were like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll let you know,\u2019\u201d Mailata recalled.",
      "He was accepted into the program and became the first player drafted from it when the Eagles took him in the seventh round that year.",
      "Mailata developed into a starter at left tackle and helped Philadelphia win the Super Bowl this year.",
      "\u201cJordan Mailata has paved the way and shown how good internationals can be in this league, given the opportunity,\u201d said Washington defensive end T.J. Maguranyanga, a former professional rugby player from Zimbabwe who\u2019s on the Commanders\u2019 practice squad after being part of this year\u2019s IPP class.",
      "Mailata is not alone in making the jump from the program to an active NFL roster spot. Defensive end Efe Obada (Nigeria/United Kingdom), fullback Jakob Johnson (Germany), tight end Sammis Reyes (Chile), defensive tackle David Bada (Germany) and tight end Thomas Odukoya (Netherlands) have also played in regular-season games.",

      "Mostly a soccer player growing up in Germany, it was a few years after seeing that Super Bowl that Wiegand tried football.",
      "He came to Tulsa, Oklahoma, as part of a high school exchange program and trained with the team when he was 17, but didn't play.",
      "\u201cThey had me as a kicker because I was super tall, but really skinny,\u201d said the 6-foot-5 Wiegand, who's now 291 pounds. \u201cI was like 190 (pounds), maybe 185, and they thought since I came from soccer, I probably could kick the ball, which I was decent.\u201d",
      "Back home, Wiegand joined the Aachen Vampires football team when he was 19, attended a showcase camp in 2019, trained with former NFL punter Chris Mohr and was offered a football scholarship to play at Central Florida.",
      "While he never played at UCF and returned to Germany, Wiegand played professionally in his home country, including with the Munich Ravens in 2024, when his offensive line coach was Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Thomas. He was selected for the IPP last December and signed after the draft in April with the Jets.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re so far away from your comfort zone in any type of form,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cI\u2019m in a different country and, I mean, I speak the language, but not perfectly. And then, it\u2019s a new job, it\u2019s a new game and everything. I\u2019m just super glad how supportive everybody has been and really helped me make the transition.\"",
      "Most of the participants in the program can relate to Wiegand's journey.",
      "Maguranyanga grew up in Zimbabwe, attended high school in South Africa, went pro in rugby and played in France.",
      "Maguranyanga's first trip to the United States came when he joined the IPP's workouts in January at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.",
      "\u201cI was 12 when I moved to South Africa and 18 when I moved to France, so I think I\u2019m just used to (experiencing) different people and different cultures,\u201d the 22-year-old Maguranyanga said. \u201cI assimilated pretty well. And growing up, watching so many American sports, I was excited to be here.\u201d",
      "Wiegand and Maguranyanga are just two of this year's IPP class currently on NFL practice squads.",
      "Carolina Panthers linebacker Mapalo \u201cMaz\u201d Mwansa grew up in Peterborough, England, and played rugby, soccer, basketball, track and field and cricket in high school. He watched the Netflix series \u201cLast Chance U\u201d and \u201cQuarterback\u201d to help learn about American football.",
      "\u201cI would never have thought I would be doing this four or five years ago,\u201d Mwansa said in April. \u201cEven two years ago, football was not in the picture for me.\"",
      "The NFL's search for talent in other countries has coincided with its regular-season games in an increasing number of places.",
      "This year alone, games are being played in Brazil, England, Germany, Ireland and Spain. The NFL has games planned for next year in Australia and Mexico, in addition to Brazil and England again. And NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Asia could be a future destination.",
      "\u201cFootball is easily the biggest sport in America, but it\u2019s still got quite a way to go to catch up with how big soccer is in the world,\" Maguranyanga said. \"So playing NFL games in different countries will grow the sport and a lot more people will be attracted to it, because it\u2019s an entertaining sport to watch.",
      "\u201cOnce we get more international games and more internationals playing it, that\u2019s the right way to go for the NFL in terms of growing the game to get it as big as soccer is.\u201d",

      "Jerami Grant added 22 off the bench for the Blazers, who picked up their first road win of the season in the second game of a back-to-back after losing 114-107 at the Clippers on Sunday. Shaedon Sharpe and and Donovan Clingan chipped in with 16 apiece.",
      "Austin Reaves scored 41 points to follow up his career-high 51 in a 127-120 win at the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, but the rest of the depleted Lakers struggled to generate offense around him. Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton each had 16, and Jarred Vanderbilt scored 14.",
      "Already missing two of their best players in Luka Doncic (sprained finger/leg bruise) and LeBron James (sciatica), the Lakers didn\u2019t have guards Marcus Smart (quadriceps contusion) and Gabe Vincent (sprained left ankle), leaving Reaves as the only experienced natural ball handler. Los Angeles had seven players unavailable in total.",
      "Portland\u2019s aggressive defense took advantage by forcing 25 turnovers, and the relentless pressure allowed the Blazers to pull away in the second half.",
      "Los Angeles magnified its ball security struggles with a poor showing from 3-point range, making 7 of 27 (25.9%). Avdija nearly matched that total himself, going 5 of 8 from long range, and Holiday (4 of 7) and Grant (3 of 7) weren\u2019t far off the pace.",

      "The company also said it has signed a new agreement with its longtime backer Microsoft that gives the software giant a roughly 27% stake in OpenAI's new for-profit corporation but changes some of the details of their close partnership.",

      "\u201cOpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,\u201d said a blog post Tuesday from Bret Taylor, the chair of OpenAI's board of directors. \u201cThe nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.\u201d",
      "AGI stands for artificial general intelligence, which OpenAI defines as \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 with a mission to safely build AGI for humanity's benefit. It later started a for-profit arm.",

He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it\u2019s instead time for a \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.",
      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said.

      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",
      "University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being.

Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world\u2019s climate agenda.",
      "Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.",
      "At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.",
      "Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.",

      "Tim Andrews, 67, had the organ removed on Oct. 23 because its function was declining, according to Mass General Brigham. In a statement, his transplant team called Andrews \u201ca selfless medical pioneer and an inspiration\u201d to patients with kidney failure.",
      "Andrews\u2019 experience illustrates lessons researchers have learned with each experiment involving what's called xenotransplantation. The first attempts using pig organs gene-edited to be more humanlike \u2013 two hearts and two kidneys \u2013 were short-lived.",
      "Then researchers began considering patients not nearly as sick as prior recipients for these experiments \u2014 and an Alabama woman\u2019s pig kidney lasted 130 days before it had to be removed last spring, the record Andrews surpassed.",
      "More than 100,000 people, most needing kidneys, are on the U.S. transplant list, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews, of Concord, New Hampshire, knew his blood type is particularly hard to match and sought an alternative, getting into shape to qualify for Mass General\u2019s xenotransplant pilot study. His doctors said he remains on the transplant list.",
      "In June, the Mass General team transplanted a pig kidney into another New Hampshire man who continues to fare well. The pilot study is set to conclude with a third pig kidney transplant later this year.",

      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years.

      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",

But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",

      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",

That's so the pair gets uninterrupted bonding time and the zoo's animal care and conservation medicine team can provide round-the-clock monitoring as the baby begins to stand, nurse and explore his surroundings.",
      "The calf\u2019s father, Sabu, lives at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. They were paired through a national zoo initiative that aims to support healthy, genetically-diverse populations of threatened and endangered species in professional care.",
      "Although there have been recent signs of hope for Asian elephants in the wild, habitat degradation and the challenges of maintaining genetic diversity are among reasons they remain endangered.",

      "The one-time American tech icon reported a net income of $4.1 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the three months ending in September, up from a loss of $17 billion, or $3.88 per share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3% from last year to $13.7 billion.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Some politicians carry threats to their livelihood in the palms of their hands.",
      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",
      "It reminds Sarah Kreps, a Cornell University professor who teaches about the intersection of politics and technology, of politicians whose careers are ruined by affairs. Everyone sees the cautionary tales, but it doesn't stop the behavior.",
      "\u201cThere's this overconfidence \u2014 \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me. It happens to other people and it won't bring me down,'\u201d Kreps said.",
      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote at length about how he handled being added to the Signal text chain about military operations. He, too, initially thought it was a hoax.

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",
      "Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can\u2019t yet be called driverless because they still require \u201csafety monitors\u201d who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",
      "The robotaxi plans need approval from regulators in various states even as the ones in Washington have swarmed the company.",
      "They've opened four investigations into Tesla so far this year, including one into why it hasn't reported accidents involving its self-driving software quickly to the government as required. Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",

      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",
      "Scientists have been uncovering dinosaur mummies for over a century. Some were buried quickly after dying, while others sank into bodies of water or dried out.",
      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that\u2019s been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within mudstone of the rock formation.",

      "Remember Clippy",
      "Clippy, the animated paper clip that annoyed Microsoft Office users nearly three decades ago, might have just been ahead of its time.",
      "Microsoft introduced a new artificial intelligence character called Mico (pronounced MEE'koh) on Thursday, a blob-shaped cartoon face that will embody the software giant's Copilot virtual assistant and marks the latest attempt by tech companies to imbue their AI chatbots with more of a personality.",
      "Copilot's cute new emoji-like exterior comes as AI developers face a crossroads in how they present their increasingly capable chatbots to consumers without causing harm or backlash. Some have opted for faceless symbols, others are selling flirtatious, human-like avatars and Microsoft is looking for a middle ground that's friendly without being obsequious.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about something sad, you can see Mico\u2019s face change. You can see it dance around and move as it gets excited with you,\u201d said Jacob Andreou, corporate vice president of product and growth for Microsoft AI, in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s in this effort of really landing this AI companion that you can really feel.\u201d",
      "In the U.S. only so far, Copilot users on laptops and phone apps can speak to Mico, which changes colors and wears glasses when in \u201cstudy\u201d mode. It's also easy to shut off, which is a big difference from Microsoft's Clippit, better known as Clippy and infamous for its persistence in offering advice on word processing tools when it first appeared on desktop screens in 1997.",
      "\u201cIt was not well-attuned to user needs at the time,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cMicrosoft pushed it, we resisted it and they got rid of it. I think we\u2019re much more ready for things like that today.\u201d",
      "Reimer, co-author of a new book called \u201cHow to Make AI Useful,\u201d said AI developers are balancing how much personality to give AI assistants based on who their expected users are.",
      "Tech-savvy adopters of advanced AI coding tools may want it to \u201cact much more like a machine because at the back end they know it\u2019s a machine,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cBut individuals who are not as trustful in a machine are going to be best supported \u2014 not replaced \u2014 by technology that feels a little more like a human.\u201d",
      "Microsoft, a provider of work productivity tools that is far less reliant on digital advertising revenue than its Big Tech competitors, also has less incentive to make its AI companion overly engaging in a way that's been tied to social isolation, harmful misinformation and, in some cases, suicides.",
      "Andreou said Microsoft has watched as some AI developers veered away from \u201cgiving AI any sort of embodiment,\u201d while others are moving in the opposite direction in enabling AI girlfriends.",
      "\u201cThose two paths don\u2019t really resonate with us that much,\u201d he said.",

      "Part of Microsoft's announcements on Thursday includes the ability to invite Copilot into a group chat, an idea that resembles how AI has been integrated into social media platforms like Snapchat, where Andreou used to work, or Meta's WhatsApp and Instagram. But Andreou said those interactions have often involved bringing in AI as a joke to \u201ctroll your friends,\u201d which is different from the \u201cintensely collaborative\u201d AI-assisted workplace Microsoft has in mind.",
      "Microsoft's audience includes kids, as part of its longtime competition with Google and other tech companies to supply its technology to classrooms. Microsoft also said Thursday it's added a feature to turn Copilot into a \u201cvoice-enabled, Socratic tutor\u201d that guides students through concepts they're studying at school.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",
      "If you have a smart doorbell installed on your front door, you can have a little extra fun with visiting trick-or-treaters by adding spooky messages and specialized chimes.",

If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",

      "Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 sweeping plan for overhauling the state\u2019s aging prison system is moving forward with bipartisan support despite complaints from Republican lawmakers that their concerns were not being addressed",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' sweeping plan to overhaul Wisconsin's aging prison system, which includes closing a prison built in the 1800s, moved forward Tuesday with bipartisan support despite complaints from Republican lawmakers that their concerns weren't being addressed.",
      "A bipartisan subcommittee of the state building commission approved spending $15 million to proceed with planning for the Evers proposal. The full building commission, which Evers chairs, was expected to green-light the spending later Tuesday.",
      "Evers in February presented his plan as the best and only option to address the state\u2019s aging facilities. Problems at the lockups have included inmate deaths, assaults against staff, lockdowns, lawsuits, federal investigations, criminal charges against staff, resignations and rising maintenance costs.",
      "Republicans have opposed parts of the plan that would reduce the overall capacity of the state prison system by 700 beds and increase the number of offenders who could be released on supervision. The GOP-led Legislature called for closing the troubled prison in Green Bay by 2029, but Evers vetoed that provision earlier this year saying it couldn't be done without getting behind his entire plan.",
      "The building commission's approval on Tuesday for spending the $15 million in planning money would start that process.",
      "Republican members of the building commission complained that Evers was plowing ahead without considering other ideas or concerns from GOP lawmakers. Republican state Sen. Andre Jacque objected to reducing the number of beds in the prison system that he said is currently \u201cdangerously unsafe.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all fought for corrections reform and would have been happy to sit down with the governor and work on a very good plan for corrections reform,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mary Felzkowski. \u201cWe could have worked together to get this done but the governor said no.\u201d",

      "After the unanimous vote to move ahead, Jacque said Republicans did not want to stand in the way of moving forward but he hoped Evers would have more discussions about their concerns.",
      "Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy told Jacque that approval of the planning money was needed to keep the momentum going for closing the Green Bay prison, which Republicans support.",
      "The entire plan, once fully enacted, would take six years to complete and likely cost about $1 billion. Evers is not seeking a third term next year, so it would be up to the next governor to either continue with his plan or go in a different direction.",
      "The multitiered proposal starts with finally closing the troubled Lincoln Hills and Cooper Lake juvenile correctional facilities in northern Wisconsin, and building a new one near Madison at the site of a current minimum security prison. The Lincoln Hills campus would then be converted into a medium security adult prison. The prison in Green Bay, built in 1898, would be closed.",
      "The plan also proposes that the state\u2019s oldest prison, which was built in Waupun in 1851, be converted from a maximum-security prison to a medium security center focused on vocational training. The Stanley Correctional Center would be converted from a medium to a maximum-security prison and the prison in Hobart would be expanded to add 200 minimum security beds.",

      "The federal government shutdown is nearing the one-month mark, causing widespread effects for millions of Americans",
      "With the federal government shutdown nearing the one-month mark, Americans are starting to see the cascading effects of programs shuttered by lapses in federal funding. Some states are scrambling to find ways to account for shortfalls in food and child development assistance, and members of the military are also about to miss their first paychecks.",
      "Some federal workers have already gone without pay for weeks. But nearly a month in, reserves that had kept some programs afloat since the shutdown began are dwindling, meaning new layers of complications as Congress remains unable to reach a new agreement to fund the federal government.",
      "A look at what millions of Americans can expect this week:",
      "According to the Trump administration, funding will run out for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected using more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program flowing into November.",
      "SNAP helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries using debit cards normally loaded each month by the federal government. Some states have pledged to keep the benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 which administers the program \u2014 says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Another program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers, young children and expectant parents purchase nutritious staples, like baby formula, will likely run out of funds the following week. Earlier this month, WIC received a $300 million infusion from the Trump administration, but those funds are running out, too.",
      "Also on Friday, the nation\u2019s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing \u2014 or able \u2014 to shift money again.",
      "Last week, the Pentagon confirmed that it had accepted an anonymous $130 million gift to help pay military members during the shutdown, a bequest that amounted to a small contribution toward the billions needed to cover service member paychecks.",

      "With new grants on hold, a half-dozen Head Start programs have already missed federal disbursements they were expecting Oct. 1 but have stayed open with fast-dwindling reserves or with help from local governments.

In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed consumers to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Two decades after a Republican-controlled Congress gave gun manufacturers immunity from being sued over crimes committed with their firearms, blue state Democrats upset about gun violence think they\u2019ve found a way to penetrate that legal shield.",
      "Since 2021, 10 states have passed laws intended to make it easier to sue gunmakers and sellers.",
      "The newest such law, in Connecticut, took effect this month. It opens firearms manufacturers and retailers up to lawsuits if they don't take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of people banned from owning them, or who should be suspected of intending to use them to hurt themselves or others. Other states have allowed lawsuits against companies deemed to have created a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d through the sale or marketing of firearms.",
      "The legislation \u2014 and flurry of lawsuits against gun companies that followed \u2014 has outraged gun rights advocates, who accuse the states of trying to skirt the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.",
      "That law, which blocked a wave of similar lawsuits two decades ago, says gun companies operating legally cannot be held liable for violent acts committed by people misusing weapons.",
      "\u201cThey know these laws are unconstitutional. They know these laws violate the PLCAA,\u201d said Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation. \u201cThey don\u2019t care,\" he said, adding that the real goal of the lawsuits was to harass the industry and drain it financially.",
      "Gun control groups say the states have simply set clearer requirements for gun companies to ensure their products aren\u2019t sold or used illegally.",
      "\u201cThese laws don\u2019t just open the courthouse doors to survivors. They also force the gun industry to operate more responsibly and, most importantly, can help prevent future tragedies,\u201d said Po Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun-violence prevention group founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Congress adopted protections for the gun industry after lawsuits filed in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere attempted to hold the firearms industry responsible for violent crime.",
      "Many of those suits argued that gun companies had knowingly oversupplied certain markets with cheap handguns and ignored signs that those weapons were being trafficked to places with strict gun controls.",
      "The firearms industry and the National Rifle Association saw the lawsuits as unfair. As long as gun companies weren't breaking rules around sales, they shouldn't be held responsible for violence, they said.",

      "For example, a gunmaker that sells a faulty firearm can still be sued over dangerous defects. Another exception allows lawsuits against companies that knowingly violate laws regulating how firearms are sold and marketed.",
      "When Congress drafted that exception, it cited the example of a shop that knowingly sold a gun to someone banned from owning one, such as a convicted felon.",
      "The new state laws have sought to expand potential liability for gun companies by creating new rules for the industry. New York passed a law in 2021 requiring gun companies to create controls to prevent unlawful possession or use of their products. It also says they cannot knowingly or recklessly \u201ccontribute to a condition\u201d that endangers public safety.",

      "A federal agent had a daring plan: persuade Nicolas Maduro's chief pilot to surreptitiously divert the Venezuelan president\u2019s plane to a place where U.S. authorities could nab the strongman",
      "MIAMI -- The federal agent had a daring pitch for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s chief pilot: All he had to do was surreptitiously divert the Venezuelan president\u2019s plane to a place where U.S. authorities could nab the strongman.",
      "In exchange, the agent told the pilot in a clandestine meeting, the aviator would be made a very rich man.",
      "The conversation was tense, and the pilot left noncommittal, though he provided the agent, Edwin Lopez, with his cell number \u2014 a sign he might be interested in helping the U.S. government.",
      "Over the next 16 months, even after retiring from his government job in July, Lopez kept at it, chatting with the pilot over an encrypted messaging app.",
      "The untold, intrigue-filled saga of how Lopez tried to flip the pilot has all the elements of a Cold War spy thriller \u2014 luxury private jets, a secret meeting at an airport hangar, high-stakes diplomacy and the delicate wooing of a key Maduro lieutenant. There was even a final machination aimed at rattling the Venezuelan president about the pilot\u2019s true loyalties.",
      "More broadly, the scheme reveals the extent \u2014 and often slapdash fashion \u2014 to which the U.S. has for years sought to topple Maduro, who it blames for destroying the oil-rich nation\u2019s democracy while providing a lifeline to drug traffickers, terrorist groups and communist-run Cuba.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has taken an even harder line. This summer, the president has deployed thousands of troops, attack helicopters and warships to the Caribbean to attack fishing boats suspected of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela. In 13 strikes, including a few in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. military has killed at least 57 people.",
      "This month, Trump authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions inside Venezuela, and the U.S. government has also doubled the bounty for Maduro's capture on federal narco-trafficking charges, a move that Lopez sought to leverage in a text message to the pilot.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for your answer,\u201d Lopez wrote the pilot on Aug. 7, attaching a link to a Justice Department press release announcing the reward had risen to $50 million.",
      "Details of the ultimately unsuccessful plan were drawn from interviews with three current and former U.S. officials, as well as one of Maduro\u2019s opponents. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were either not authorized to discuss the effort or feared retribution for disclosing it. The Associated Press also reviewed \u2014 and authenticated \u2014 text exchanges between Lopez and the pilot.",
      "Attempts to locate the pilot, Venezuelan Gen. Bitner Villegas, were not successful.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the State Department did not comment. The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The plot was hatched when a tipster showed up at the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic on April 24, 2024, when Joe Biden was president. The informant purported to have information about Maduro\u2019s planes, according to three of the officials familiar with the matter.",
      "Lopez, 50, was then an attach\u00e9 at the embassy and agent for Homeland Security Investigations, a part of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "A wiry former U.S. Army Ranger from Puerto Rico, Lopez was leading the agency\u2019s investigations into transnational criminal networks with a presence in the Caribbean, after a storied career taking down drug gangs, money launderers and fraudsters. His work dismantling an illicit money-changing operation in Miami even earned him a public rebuke in 2010 from Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Maduro\u2019s predecessor. The embassy assignment was to be his last before retirement.",
      "The embassy was closed, although Lopez was still at his desk. He was handed a 3x5 index card with the tipster\u2019s name and phone number. When he called, the tipster claimed that two planes used by Maduro were in the Dominican Republic undergoing costly repairs.",
      "Lopez was intrigued: He knew that any maintenance was most likely a criminal violation under U.S. law because it would\u2019ve involved the purchase of American parts, prohibited by sanctions on Venezuela. The planes were also subject to seizure \u2013 for violating those same sanctions.",
      "Locating the aircraft was easy \u2013 they were housed in La Isabela executive airport in Santo Domingo. Tracing them to Maduro would take federal investigators months. As they built that case, they learned that the Venezuelan president had dispatched five pilots to the island to retrieve the multimillion-dollar jets \u2013 a Dassault Falcon 2000EX and Dassault Falcon 900EX.",
      "Lopez had an epiphany, according to the current and former officials familiar with the operation: What if he could persuade the pilot to fly Maduro to a place where the U.S. could arrest him?",
      "Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on federal narco-terrorism charges accusing him of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.",
      "The DHS agent secured permission from his superiors and Dominican authorities to question the pilots, overcoming the officials' concerns about creating a diplomatic rift with Venezuela.",
      "At the airport hangar, a short distance from the jet, Lopez and fellow agents asked each pilot to join them individually in a small conference room. There was no agenda, the agents said. They just wanted to talk.",
      "The agents pretended not to know that the pilots spent their time jetting around Maduro and other top officials. They spoke to each airman for about an hour, saving their biggest target for last: Villegas, who the agents had determined was Maduro\u2019s regular pilot.",
      "Villegas was a member of the elite presidential honor guard and colonel in the Venezuelan air force. A former Venezuelan official who regularly traveled with the president described him as friendly, reserved and trusted by Maduro. The planes he flew were used to shuttle Maduro across the globe \u2013- often to U.S. adversaries like Iran, Cuba and Russia. In a December 2023 video posted online by Maduro, Villegas can be seen holding up a radio in the cockpit as the president trades patriotic slogans with the pilot of a Russian Sukhoi fighter jet.",
      "Lopez called Villegas into the room, and they bantered for a while about celebrities the pilot had shuttled around, his military service and the types of jets he was licensed to fly, according to two of the people familiar with the operation. After about 15 minutes, the pilot began to grow tense, and his legs started to shake.",
      "The agent drilled in more sharply: Had the pilot ever flown Ch\u00e1vez or Maduro? Villegas at first tried to dodge the questions, but eventually admitted he had been a pilot for both leaders. Villegas showed the agents photos on his phone of him and the two presidents on various trips. He also provided details about Venezuelan military installations he had visited. Unbeknownst to Villegas, one of Lopez\u2019s colleagues recorded the conversation on a cell phone.",
      "As the conversation wrapped up, the two people said, Lopez made his pitch: In exchange for secretly ferrying Maduro into America\u2019s hands, the pilot would become very rich and beloved by millions of his compatriots. The rendezvous could be of the pilot\u2019s choosing: the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
      "Villegas didn\u2019t tip his hand. Yet, before departing, he gave Lopez his cell number.",
      "Villegas and the other pilots returned to Venezuela without the aircraft, which they were told lacked the proper clearances.",

      "The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has been making the case that the United States will no longer be footing the bill the way it has since the world body\u2019s founding eight decades ago",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Mike Waltz is approaching his new role as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a mandate from President Donald Trump to cut funding for what were once longtime American priorities the same way he set about representing Florida in Congress.",
      "\u201cI approach nearly every decision I can here with America first, with the American taxpayer first,\u201d Waltz said virtually at a recent event at the Richard Nixon Foundation. \u201cSo, if I had to stand up in a town hall with a group of mechanics and firemen and women and nurses and teachers and testify to them that their money is being well spent in line with our interest, that would be incredibly tough right now.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re using, quite frankly, our contribution as leverage for reform\u201d at the U.N.",
      "In recent meetings with U.N. officials, including Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Waltz and his colleagues at the U.S. mission have made the case that the United States \u2014 the U.N.'s largest donor \u2014 will no longer be footing the bill the way it has since the world body\u2019s founding eight decades ago.",
      "Instead, U.S. officials are taking an a la carte approach to paying U.N. dues, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump's agenda and which no longer serve U.S. interests. It is a major shift from how previous administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.",
      "Shortly after being confirmed as ambassador, Waltz met with Guterres as world leaders gathered at the U.N. General Assembly last month. The former congressman said in a Sept. 25 interview with Larry Kudlow on Fox Business that he made it clear to the top U.N. official that U.S.-backed changes would need to take place \u201cbefore you start talking about taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWashington\u2019s decision does send a worrying signal that powerful countries can get away with this and really try to apply more pressure through a process that is meant to give the organization the backing it needs to execute the mandates that every country agrees on,\u201d said Daniel Forti, senior U.N. analyst at the International Crisis Group.",
      "The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment or an interview with Waltz.",
      "The U.S. is demanding changes to the salaries and benefits of some high-ranking U.N. officials until the U.S. \"can get better transparency,\u201d and it wants the creation of an independent inspector general to oversee the complex financial system within the world body.",
      "But some U.N. organizations have been written off entirely. Waltz has said in interviews that U.S. retreats from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. aid agency in Gaza known as UNRWA, and the Human Rights Council are permanent. In other areas, like contributions to the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, the U.S. decision to pull support won\u2019t go into effect until December 2026.",
      "Many U.N. staffers and groups are now watching to see if the Trump administration's targeting of climate and gender initiatives also will result in significant cuts to two of the most important priorities of the U.N. operation.",
      "That pressure, coupled with years of dwindling support for humanitarian aid, has forced Guterres to propose a 15% cut to the entire U.N. budget, an 18% cut to personnel and a 25% cut to peacekeeping operations around the world.",
      "\u201cIt is a deliberate and considered adjustment to an already conservative proposal for 2026 \u2014 reflecting both the urgency and ambition of the reforms we are undertaking,\u201d Guterres told a U.N. budget committee this month.",

As a result, roughly 13,000 to 14,000 military and police personnel out of more than 50,000 peacekeepers deployed to nine global missions will be sent home.",
      "U.N. officials have warned that the consequences of withdrawing those troops from previous conflict zones in South Sudan, Kosovo and Cyprus, among other places, will be serious and long term.",
      "Guterres says that while \u201crepresenting a tiny fraction of global military spending \u2014 around one half of 1% \u2014 U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most effective and cost-effective tools to build international peace and security.\u201d",
      "U.N. watchers say the U.S. cuts and changes go beyond pushing conservative financial values on an international organization and will result in a shift that will fundamentally change the way the United Nations operates around the world.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve also found is that there\u2019s really no other country around the world besides the U.S. that has been willing or able to step up and take on that role of financial underwriter in any considerable way,\" said Forti of the International Crisis Group. \u201cNot China, not the European countries, not the Gulf.\u201d",
      "That is forcing development and humanitarian agencies to scale back \u201cwhat the U.N. can actually deliver on the ground and with little prospect of the U.S. returning at scale to that role at play before,\u201d he said.",
      "Even with these cuts underway, Waltz has pushed back on concerns that the U.S. would completely retreat from the U.N., echoing Trump's recent speech in the General Assembly about the \u201cgreat\" but untapped potential of the world body.",
      "The U.S. wants to expand its influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.",
      "\u201cWe are still the largest bill payer,\" Waltz said at the Nixon event last week. \u201cChina is creeping up to a very close second, and this is a key space in our competition with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d",
      "He said he understands those in the Republican base who say \u201cwe should just shut the place down, turn out the lights on the embassy and walk away.\u201d",
      "But, Waltz added, \u201cWe still need one place in the world where everyone can talk, even if it\u2019s with the North Koreans, the Venezuelans, the Europeans, Russians, (and) the Chinese.\u201d",

      "Some Chicago parents and teachers say children were traumatized by a recent immigration enforcement action involving tear gas",
      "CHICAGO -- Just before noon on a sunny Friday earlier this month, federal immigration agents threw tear gas canisters onto a busy Chicago street, just outside of an elementary school and a children\u2019s play cafe.",
      "Parents, teachers and caretakers rushed to shield children from the chaos, and have been grappling ever since with how to explain to them what they\u2019d seen: how much to tell them so they know enough to stay safe, but not too much to rob them of their innocence.",
      "Weeks later, families \u2014 even those not likely in danger of being rounded up in immigration raids \u2014 say they remain terrified it will happen again, demonstrating how fear seeps into every facet of American life when the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown takes over a city.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Border Patrol agents were \u201cimpeded by protesters\u201d during a targeted enforcement operation in which one man was arrested.",
      "The Chicago crackdown, dubbed \u201cOperation Midway Blitz,\u201d began in early September. Masked, armed agents in unmarked trucks patrol neighborhoods, and residents have protested in ways big and small against what they see as their city under siege.",
      "DHS wrote that its agents are being terrorized: \u201cOur brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, inducing sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. This violence against law enforcement must END. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe.\u201d",
      "The agents arrived in an unmarked SUV about half a block from Funston Elementary School in Logan Square, a neighborhood on the city\u2019s northwest side. Videos show they were being tailed by cars that were honking their horns to alert neighbors that this was an immigration enforcement operation. A scooter pulled in front of the SUV to try to block it in.",
      "The SUV\u2019s passenger side window rolled down and a masked man inside threw the tear gas canisters onto the street.",

      "As Oliva-Perez fumbled getting the whistle to her lips, the SUV\u2019s window rolled down and the masked man threw the first gas canister.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t fathom that was happening,\u201d said Oliva-Perez. Then he threw another, this time in her direction.",
      "She said she was only feet away on the sidewalk and didn\u2019t hear the agents say anything. Then she ran toward the school, yelling at staff to get the children inside.",

    "story": [
      "House Republicans have released a long-promised report on former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen and the alleged cover-up of his mental state while in office",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on former President Joe Biden\u2019s use of the autopen, delivering a blistering critique of his time in office and inner circle that largely rehashes public information while making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.",
      "The GOP report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden\u2019s knowledge or that the president was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. But Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions in office. They sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. President Donald Trump ordered a similar inquiry earlier this year.",
      "At its core, the report advances contested claims that Biden's mental state declined to a degree that allowed White House officials to enact policies without his knowledge. It focuses heavily on the pardons he granted in office, including to his son, Hunter Biden, based on depositions with close Biden aides.",
      "\u201cThe cost of the scheme to hide the fallout of President Biden\u2019s diminished physical and mental acuity was great but will likely never be fully calculated,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThe cover-up put American national security at risk and the nation\u2019s trust in its leaders in jeopardy.\u201d",
      "Biden has strenuously denied he was unaware of his administration\u2019s actions, calling such claims \u201cridiculous and false.\u201d Democrats on the House Oversight committee denounced the probe as a distraction and waste of time.",
      "Republicans are shifting attention back to Biden at a politically tumultuous time, 10 months into Trump\u2019s presidency, with the government shut down and Congress at a standstill over legislation to fund it. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of session for nearly a month, with most public-facing committee work grinding to a halt.",
      "The report on Biden was largely compiled over several months before the shutdown began. Based on interviews with more than a dozen members of Biden\u2019s inner circle, the report offers few new revelations, instead drawing broad conclusions from unanswered questions.",
      "It includes repeated references to polls of Biden\u2019s approval rating and perceptions of his public gaffes and apparent aging, much of it publicly known.",
      "It alleges a \u201ccover-up of the president\u2019s cognitive decline\u201d orchestrated by Biden's inner circle and takes particular aim at Biden\u2019s doctor, Kevin O\u2019Connor, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against testifying. Republicans also singled out senior aides Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini, who similarly pleaded the Fifth. All three \u201cshould face further scrutiny\" from the Justice Department, Republicans said.",

      "While the report claims that record-keeping policies in the Biden White House \u201cwere so lax that the chain of custody for a given decision is difficult or impossible to establish,\" Republicans do not offer any concrete instances of the chain of command being violated or a policy being enacted without Biden's knowledge.",
      "Still, Republicans argue that Biden's use of the autopen should be considered invalid unless there is documented proof of him approving a decision.",
      "\u201cBarring evidence of executive actions taken during the Biden presidency showing that President Biden indeed took a particular executive action, the committee deems those actions taken through use of the autopen as void,\u201d the report says.",
      "Democrats and legal experts have warned that broad scrutiny of executive actions could pose future legal headaches for the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, who also often enact policies directed by lawmakers through devices like the presidential autopen.",

      "Rosenberg testified she disguised herself as a Petaluma Poultry worker using a fake badge and earpiece, according to The Press Democrat, a newspaper in Santa Rosa where the trial is being held. She shared a videotape on social media that showed what she did. She said she was acting out of concern about animal cruelty, not as part of a criminal conspiracy.",

      "\u201cThese chickens were incredibly ill and they needed care and I think that when an animal is in distress, when an animal is being abused and the authorities aren\u2019t stepping in, and they aren\u2019t helping those animals that we do have the legal right to help them ourselves,\" Rosenberg told The Associated Press in an interview before Tuesday's closing arguments in the trial.",

The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won't be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.",
      "The Agriculture Department says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department's previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:53:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old.

      "Copeland made history in 2015 when she became the first Black woman to be promoted to principal dancer in the history of the company, which was founded in 1939.

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:17:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring when announcing the central bank's first rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate is still low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

      "At a press conference on Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted air traffic controllers' financial struggles\u00a0as they go without pay.",
      "\"This is day one,\" he said of controllers missing their first full paychecks. \"Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].\"",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",

      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states.

      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut on Wednesday.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany. Everything is produced in Germany, and we are also for safety,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"It was just a world event happening with one of our machines, and we tried to use it. And we really do not want \u2026 anybody to get bad feelings about that. And if so, we are sorry for that.\"",

      "Consumer confidence slid for the third month in a row, new data shows, a sign that Americans' view of the economy is dimming in the face of a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation.",
      "The University of Michigan's October sentiment index, released Friday, shows consumer confidence fell 1.5% on a monthly basis to 53.6%. The index has recovered slightly after dipping to a three-year low in April, but still remains below its January level over deepening concerns about vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy, experts note.",
      "\"The lower to median end of the income spectrum are increasingly concerned about job prospects and income prospects, and that is weighing on their morale at a time where prices are rising,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS News prior to the index's release. \"So it's really an affordability issue.\"",

      "The\u00a0U.S. government shutdown appears to have had little impact for now on how people view the economy.

    "story": [
      "Jill Hornick, a 59-year-old service representative at a Social Security Administration field office in Illinois, would normally have received her latest paycheck on Friday. Instead, she was last paid on Oct. 10 \u2014 for three days less than she had worked.",
      "Hornick is defined as an essential worker and continues to report to the office on a daily basis during the government shutdown. She said she doesn't have time to search for a second job and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",
      "While roughly 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, approximately 730,000 other government employees deemed essential \u2014 such as air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers\u00a0\u2014 continue to work without pay during the shutdown, according to estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Hornick, whose annual income is about $75,000 a year, is now scrambling to stay afloat. That means paring her spending and contacting her mortgage lender and other creditors to ask for lenience.",
      "\"I got a letter from mortgage company saying I was approved for deferred payment and that they wouldn't take foreclosure action against me,\" she said, although she remains anxious about what the future will bring.",
      "\"Who knows how long my mortgage company will allow this to go on before they foreclose on my house,\" Hornick added.",
      "Hornick said she has eliminated what she describes as \"all nonessential spending.\"",
      "\"I had a hair appointment for Saturday that I made before the shutdown and it's canceled because I have dogs, so I am making sure they are fed and have veterinarian care,\" she said.",

      "Mae apGovannon, 49, works in Portland, Oregon, at a regional office for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, where he processes claims for veterans benefits.",
      "apGovannon said some of his home appliances, including his oven, have stopped working, but repairs will have to wait until he gets paid. To reduce their costs, he and his partner are also cutting back on entertainment, such as going to the movies and eating out.",
      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",
      "Hornick, who is nearing the end of her career at the SSA and plans to retire from government work, said she would \"not recommend anyone come work for the federal government with everything that's going on.\"",
      "Accruing interest as shutdown continues",
      "Brooke Hardison, 47, a furloughed communications director at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, said she is accruing interest on unpaid credit card bills and feels like she \"has to protect every penny, because we just don't know what happens next.\"",
      "That's meant canceling travel and delaying repairing a faulty door in her home, Hardison said. Her husband works for a government contractor focused on information technology, potentially putting his income in jeopardy as long as federal funding remains frozen.",
      "\"It is up in the air,\" she said. \"We are bracing for impact to both of our jobs.\"",
      "Like other federal workers, Hardison, who lives in Bowie, Maryland and who has worked for the government for 20 years, said that for the first time she is considering leaving public service for the private sector.",
      "\"I had started thinking about looking outside the government because of the changes that have happened in being a government employee, and the totality of the job,\" she told CBS News. \"I always assumed I would retire from the government.

Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.\"",

      "Mr. Trump is expected to address the summit Wednesday morning, local time, and meet with Xi a day later. He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant partners with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for more access to China's market.",
      "The stop marks the final leg of his Asia tour, after visits to Malaysia and Japan in a five-day swing that's largely been focused on trade and economic ties in the South Pacific. Mr. Trump is aiming to cement trade deals and extract tariffs from other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that additional 100% tariffs that Mr. Trump had threatened on Chinese goods were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "Gyeongju, with a population of about 250,000 in southeastern Korea, sits on the opposite side of the country as Seoul, the nation's capital, and thus, is farther from neighboring North Korea. Mr. Trump has said he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, but no such meeting has been planned. In Mr. Trump's first term, he became the first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after he put an invitation to Kim on social media.",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, with promoting free trade being a major component of the forum \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries. APEC members include China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "Before leaving Tokyo, Mr. Trump also signed a trade deal with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry. And the president announced trade frameworks with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with China's Xi could be a tense one, as the two world powers have clashed on trade and tariffs for months.",
      "The president is pressing Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace, threatening 100% tariffs starting Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "The trade war has also led China to cut off purchases of U.S. soybeans, hitting American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday he expects the soybean boycott to end. And Mr. Trump needs Chinese approval for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent ByteDance.",

    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country.

    "summary": "Officials from half the states and the District of Columbia are asking a federal judge to order the Department of Agriculture to provide food stamp benefits for November.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-autopen-investigation-republicans-report-house-oversight/",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:47:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP majority report criticized Biden's autopen use, but did not offer clear evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without his knowledge.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen, delivering a blistering critique of his time in office and inner circle. The report largely rehashes information that was already public, however, while making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.",
      "The GOP report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden's knowledge or that the president was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. But Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions in office. They sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. President Trump ordered a similar inquiry earlier this year.",
      "At its core, the report advances contested claims that Biden's mental state declined to a degree that allowed White House officials to enact policies without his knowledge. It focuses heavily on the pardons he granted\u00a0while in office, including to his son, Hunter Biden, based on depositions with close Biden aides.",
      "\"The cost of the scheme to hide the fallout of President Biden's diminished physical and mental acuity was great but will likely never be fully calculated,\" the report reads. \"The cover-up put American national security at risk and the nation's trust in its leaders in jeopardy.\"",
      "Biden has strenuously denied he was unaware of his administration's actions, calling such claims \"ridiculous and false.\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee denounced the probe as a distraction and waste of time, issuing a 13-page memo on Tuesday that said \"following more than a year of inquiry, extensive witness interviews, and significant time and effort expended by both Republican and Democratic staff, the Oversight Majority has failed to produce any evidence to support their allegations against President Biden.\"",
      "Democrats said in the memo that 14 former White House officials and aides provided nearly 60 hours of testimony.",
      "In a statement, a Biden spokesperson said it was an investigation into \"baseless claims\" that proved \"there was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing.\"",
      "Republicans are shifting attention back to Biden at a politically tumultuous time, 10 months into Mr. Trump's presidency, with the government shut down and Congress at a standstill over legislation to fund it. House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session for nearly a month, with most public-facing committee work grinding to a halt.",
      "Mr. Trump and his staff have zeroed in on Biden's autopen usage, with the White House in September putting a picture of an autopen along portraits of previous presidents the West Wing Colonnade. A White House official said at the time that Mr. Trump selected the autopen picture himself.",
      "The report on Biden was largely compiled over several months before the shutdown began. Based on interviews with more than a dozen members of Biden's inner circle, the report offers few new revelations, instead drawing broad conclusions from unanswered questions.",
      "It includes repeated references to polls of Biden's approval rating and perceptions of his public gaffes and apparent aging, much of it publicly known.",
      "It alleges a \"cover-up of the president's cognitive decline\" orchestrated by Biden's inner circle and takes particular aim at Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against testifying. Republicans also singled out senior aides Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini, who similarly pleaded the Fifth. All three \"should face further scrutiny\" from the Justice Department, Republicans said.",
      "Jonathan Su, Tomasini's attorney, said during her interview with the committee, \"There is no actual evidence of wrongdoing by Ms. Tomasini.\" Noting the ongoing criminal investigation by the Justice Department, he said \"any reasonable person would seriously consider an invocation of their Fifth Amendment rights\u2026The law is clear that there is absolutely no basis to suggest an invocation of the Fifth Amendment is evidence of wrongdoing.\" Su, who also represents Bernal, similarly told the committee on his behalf that \"it is entirely appropriate and justified for Mr. Bernal to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\"",
      "Republicans also sent a letter to the D.C. Board of Medicine urging that O'Connor face \"discipline, sanction or revocation of his medical license\" and \"be barred from the practice of medicine in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "O'Connor's attorneys, David Schertler and Mark MacDougall, said in July that he would decline to answer lawmakers' questions based on doctor-patient privilege and his rights under the Fifth Amendment, and they said that asserting Fifth Amendment privilege \"does not imply that Dr. O'Connor has committed any crime.\"",
      "The report does not include full transcripts of the multiple hours of recorded testimony that witnesses delivered before the committee. It repeatedly scolds Biden officials and Democratic allies for defending Biden's mental state.",
      "\"The inner-most circle, or cocoon, of the White House senior staff organized one of the largest scandals in American history \u2014 hiding a cognitively failing president and refusing any means of confirmation of such demise,\" the report says.",
      "While the report claims that record-keeping policies in the Biden White House \"were so lax that the chain of custody for a given decision is difficult or impossible to establish,\" Republicans do not offer any concrete instances of the chain of command being violated or a policy being enacted without Biden's knowledge.",
      "Still, Republicans argue that laws or other legal documents bearing an autopen version of Biden's signature\u00a0 should be considered invalid unless there is documented proof of him approving a decision.",
      "\"Barring evidence of executive actions taken during the Biden presidency showing that President Biden indeed took a particular executive action, the committee deems those actions taken through use of the autopen as void,\" the report says.",
      "Democrats and legal experts have warned that broad scrutiny of executive actions could pose future legal headaches for the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, who also often enact policies directed by lawmakers through devices like the presidential autopen.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing.",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",
      "They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before smiling for a photo together, then walked inside the palace for a roughly half-hour meeting that the White House described as a \"courtesy call.\"",
      "The American leader spent Sunday in Malaysia, participating in a regional summit of Southeast Asian nations where he struck preliminary trade agreements with Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.",

      "Officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday that they'd reached an initial consensus for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect for President Xi,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"I think we're going to come away with a deal,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Bessent also\u00a0said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a TikTok deal announced last month was set to be finalized Thursday during the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "After his visit to Japan, Mr. Trump is set to end his Asian tour in South Korea, where he's expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.",
      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "Mr. Trump's overtures to reconnect with Kim have gone unanswered.",
      "\"If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump rules out running for U.S. vice presidency",
      "On other matters, Mr. Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, \"I'd be allowed to do it,\" but \"I wouldn't do that.\"",
      "\"I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not \u2014 it wouldn't be right.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Mr. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.",
      "On Air Force One, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't really thought about it.\"",
      "He praised Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. \"I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,\" he said.",
      "South China Sea, Taiwan, and tariffs",
      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",
      "The president flew to Tokyo from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

    "summary": "President Trump's lawyers filed their long-promised appeal of the Manhattan \"hush money\" criminal case that led to his felony conviction.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's lawyers on Monday filed their long-promised appeal of the Manhattan \"hush money\" criminal case that led to his felony conviction.",
      "The president's attorneys echoed arguments that Mr. Trump and his trial counsel made repeatedly throughout the proceedings in the spring of 2024. They said the case should not have been brought, the judge should have recused himself because he had previously made small donations to Democratic causes. They also argued the conviction should be discarded due to the Supreme Court's July 2024 ruling on presidential immunity. That decision was tied to another of Mr. Trump's criminal cases, but his lawyers said it has a bearing on Mr. Trump's conviction in the New York case. Many of these same arguments were rejected during the criminal trial in Manhattan.",
      "\"This case should have never seen the inside of a courtroom, let alone resulted in a jury conviction,\" the lawyers, led by Robert Giuffra Jr., wrote in the 96-page filing.",
      "The appeal is part of a multi-pronged effort by Mr. Trump to attempt to overturn the conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has also asked a federal appeals court to transfer his state case to federal court.",
      "The case revolved around Mr. Trump's efforts to cover up so-called \"hush money\" payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued during the trial that Mr. Trump, through his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election to suppress her story of an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The jury concluded that Mr. Trump authorized an effort to falsify records related to reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for that payment.",
      "The trial played out over seven weeks last spring, in effect relegating Mr. Trump's third presidential campaign to hallway gaggles outside the courtroom. As Mr. Trump himself did regularly before, during and after the trial, his lawyers accused Bragg on Monday of bringing the case for political gain.",
      "\"The DA, a Democrat, brought those charges in the middle of a contentious presidential election in which President Trump was the leading Republican candidate. These charges against President Trump were as unprecedented as their political context,\" Mr. Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "Bragg's office declined to comment on Mr. Trump's filing.",
      "Days before his return to the White House in January, Mr. Trump received a no-jail sentence. His felony criminal conviction, however, remains on the books unless the jury's verdict is overturned.",
      "Mr. Trump's lead attorney during the trial, Todd Blanche, is now the deputy U.S. attorney general. Another lawyer from his trial team, Emil Bove III, was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Trump's legal team called the appeal a \"powerhouse.\"",

    "summary": "Tylenol maker Kenvue said Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation.",
    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson, claiming the use of Tylenol leads to higher risk of autism and that the over-the-counter drug is deceptively marketed to pregnant women as safe.",
      "Many medical experts have disputed such claims.",
      "The lawsuit, dated Monday, alleges Johnson & Johnson and Tylenol maker Kenvue, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, knew for decades \"that acetaminophen \u2014 Tylenol's active ingredient \u2014 is dangerous to unborn children and young children. Yet they hid this danger and deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women.\"",
      "In the lawsuit, Paxton pointed to the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen's risks, saying that: \"the federal government confirmed what Defendants knew for years: acetaminophen use during pregnancy likely causes conditions like [autism] and [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder].\"",
      "Paxton also accused Johnson & Johnson of transferring its liabilities arising from Tylenol to Kenvue in order to shield its assets from potential lawsuits related to Tylenol and its alleged \"harmful impact\" on children.",
      "Kenvue said in a statement that Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation. It maintained that acetaminophen \"is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "\"We are deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children,\" Kenvue said.",
      "Kenvue also warned that failing to treat fevers and other ailments with acetaminophen could also expose pregnant women to health risks.",
      "\"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives,\" Kenvue's statement continued. \"High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.\"",
      "A Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News: \"Johnson & Johnson divested its consumer health business years ago, and all rights and liabilities associated with the sale of its over-the-counter products, including Tylenol (acetaminophen), are owned by Kenvue.\"",
      "In September, President Trump, standing alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.\u00a0 Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0announced\u00a0the FDA would immediately notify physicians \"that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.\"",
      "Kennedy said the FDA based its decision on studies that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including\u00a0one study\u00a0in the public health journal Environmental Health. He added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "After the Trump administration issued its warning about Tylenol, many top medical experts in the field\u00a0stressed\u00a0that scientific evidence does not support such concerns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000.",
      "She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",

      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",

    "story": [
      "A judge ruled Monday that the 22-year-old Utah man charged in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Attorneys for Tyler Robinson argued that images of him shackled and in jail clothing would spread widely in a case with extensive press coverage and public interest, which they said could prejudice future potential jurors.",
      "Judge Tony Graf approved limited measures to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn \"extraordinary\" public and media attention.",
      "\"Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent,\" Graf said during a virtual court hearing on Monday.",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was assassinated on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate.",
      "Robinson was charged last month with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray has said they will plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "While Robinson has no prior criminal history, Judge Graf said Monday that the charges he faces are extremely serious and present safety concerns in the courtroom. It's the court's highest priority to protect the attorneys, court staff and Robinson himself during what could be emotional hearings, Graf said before denying Robinson's request to appear without restraints. He did, however, prohibit members of the media from photographing or filming Robinson's restraints.",
      "Robinson was arrested on Sept. 12 when he showed up with his parents to turn himself in at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from Orem. He is being held at the Utah County Jail without bail and hasn't yet entered a plea.",
      "As law enforcement agencies were scouring the state for the shooter last month, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he received a phone call from a retired deputy saying he knew who killed Kirk.",
      "\"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily,'\" Brooksby said at the time.",
      "\"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" Brooksby said. \"So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen.\"",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources previously confirmed to CBS News that\u00a0Robinson's father saw the photos\u00a0released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:42:39 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump recently said a \"patriot,\" reported by the New York Times to be Timothy Mellon, donated $130 million in an effort to keep troops paid during the shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous \"patriot\" had given a donation of $130 million\u00a0 \u2014 money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the government shutdown.",
      "There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune.",
      "Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.",
      "Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, \"Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors.\"",
      "Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought.",
      "He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\"",
      "Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:",
      "At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election",
      "Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle \u2014 at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.",
      "Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced Project 2025, the policy blueprint the Trump administration has relied on in overhauling the federal government.",
      "$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign",
      "Mellon also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially.",
      "But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.",
      "$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth",
      "Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, \"never have been, never will be.\" The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion.",
      "340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.",
      "$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas",
      "In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress \u2014 the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.",
      "The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.",
      "In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.",
      "The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities \u2014 including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes \u2014 have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, \"The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.\"",
      "The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.",
      "Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities \u2014 and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.",
      "\"We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,\" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.",
      "Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.",
      "In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open.",
      "\"Some partners haven't been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said. \"We're delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\"",
      "Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings.",
      "\"When a clinic can't process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\"",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",

    "title": "Political violence has gripped the U.S. Experts say it's not as simple as left and right.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/political-violence-experts-left-and-right/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 16:09:52 -0400",
    "summary": "A nationwide string of threats and violent acts present a problem experts say is politically more complex than it seems.",
    "story": [
      "It's a bipartisan problem in a country beset by polarization: Since the start of 2025, political violence has killed, injured or threatened conservative and liberal political figures alike.",
      "This month, a pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to \"eliminate\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City, and a Minnesota man was charged with offering a $45,000 bounty for Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest in a jarring trend of threats and violent acts against political figures.",
      "In September, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on a Utah college campus. Afterwards, the alleged shooter told his roommate, \"some hate can't be negotiated out,\" according to court documents.",
      "Three months earlier in Minnesota, Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed at home, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were shot on the same night. Two months before that, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home was set on fire while he and his family slept.",
      "Also this year: Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in D.C. were fatally shot, a Republican Party of New Mexico office was targeted in an arson attack, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities were shot at and a California fertility clinic was bombed, among other violent incidents.",
      "And before that, President Trump survived two attempts on his life and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was beaten with a hammer at home. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's would-be assassin walked in front of his home, but then had second thoughts, called an emergency line and admitted traveling to Maryland to kill a Supreme Court justice.",
      "The trend has drawn a divided response. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused the \"radical left\" of fomenting violence, while Democrats argue that right-wing extremism is a problem, too.",
      "But while some of these perpetrators may have claimed political rationales for their violent acts, it's hard to argue any of them were adherents to a cohesive political cause. They were mostly lone actors driven by personal gripes, researchers who study political violence say \u2014 so some experts suggest the frame of partisan politics may not be the best way of understanding the problem.",
      "\"The rush to assign blame to the traditional binary of left versus right politically, I think, is an exercise in futility,\" said Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, \"because it's much more complicated than that a lot of times.\"",
      "\"Salad bar extremism\"",
      "There's some research on the political motives of violent acts. One report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found right-wing terrorism has been more common than left-wing terrorism in the U.S. over the last decade, but this year, left-wing incidents are on track to take the lead for the first time in over 30 years.",
      "It's difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from this report because the total number of acts of terrorism has dropped. From 2016 through last year, there were an average of 22.7 attacks and plots from the right and four from the left annually, while in the first half of this year, there were five left-wing incidents and just one on the right.",
      "Many people who carry out political violence have views that are tough to pin down, or they hold a mix of beliefs that don't align with either side of the partisan divide.",
      "Take the bombing at a Southern California fertility clinic that injured four people in May.\u00a0 Authorities say the perpetrator \u2014 who died in the attack \u2014 appeared to believe in \"anti-natalism\" and \"pro-mortalism,\" a set of obscure philosophies that argue it's wrong to bring children into the world against their will, or that view death as preferable to life.",
      "\"Not only are the people carrying out this violence not stooges of a political party or affiliated with the political parties, they're not really affiliated with the mainstream political ideologies that either espouses,\" said Kieran Doyle, North America research manager at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, which tracks political violence globally.",
      "Some violent actors hold \"a hodgepodge of different, sometimes apparently contradictory, political motivations,\" said Doyle, who called that phenomenon \"salad bar extremism.\"",
      "In some cases, the perpetrators' motives are hazy. Baumgartner pointed to Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shot at Mr. Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania last year, grazing the then-presidential candidate's ear and killing a rallygoer before he was fatally shot by the Secret Service. The 20-year-old's motives and political leanings are shrouded in mystery \u2014 he searched online for information about both Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News last year.",
      "And in other cases, perpetrators of violence have no obvious ideology at all.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel testified earlier this month that a large share of the bureau's domestic terror probes are focused on a category called \"nihilistic violent extremism,\" which he defined as violent acts that are \"motivated by a deep hatred of society.\"",
      "\"The reasons why they're carrying out these attacks are not inherently political,\" Baumgartner said of nihilistic extremists, which he said includes some recent school shooters in Nashville and Minneapolis. \"They are not doing it to further some political, religious, ethnonationalist \u2026 cause. They're just doing it for the sake of committing an act of violence.\"",
      "Violence dominated by lone wolves with personalized motives",
      "Perpetrators of violence also rarely belong to organized groups with clear goals and motives,\u00a0 experts say.",
      "Cionadh Raleigh, CEO of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, told CBS News that violent acts by groups like far-right militias are on a long-term decline. \"There are many groups, but they're very inactive,\" she said.",
      "But killings or assassinations by lone actors \"have been consistently high in the States now for decades,\" said Raleigh.",
      "Baumgartner said the only recent high-profile act of political violence with an obvious link to a wider group was the July shooting at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. More than a dozen people have been arrested in connection with that shooting, and authorities say many of the defendants harbored anarchist views or beliefs in line with antifa, a loosely defined left-wing movement. One of the suspects has been described as a cult-like leader.",
      "But in general, Baumgartner said, political violence is \"primarily conducted by individuals who have a highly personalized and individualized ideology, if you can call it that.\"",
      "In some cases, these lone actors are \"deeply immersed in niche online subcultures\" and have grown alienated from society for various reasons, he said. He argues that profile fits the Trump rally shooter Crooks, alleged Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson and Dallas ICE shooter Joshua Jahn.",
      "\"They end up basically becoming irony-poisoned, and anything that is transgressive or subversive and goes against social mores is what they find appealing,\" he said.",
      "Political threats on the rise",
      "The vast majority of Americans reject political violence \u2014 one CBS News poll released earlier this month found 86% of Americans believe it's unacceptable.",
      "But threats against public officials appear to be on the rise.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police is on track to investigate over 14,000 possible threats against lawmakers and their offices this year, Chief Michael Sullivan said last month, up from 9,474 in an already busy 2024. And the U.S. Marshals Service investigated 562 threats against federal judges in the 2025 fiscal year, up from 509 in 2024 but down from 630 in 2023.",
      "Lower-profile local politicians haven't been spared either. Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative recorded almost 300 instances of threats and harassment against mayors, city councilors and other local officials in the first half of 2025, up 9% year-over-year.",
      "Roudabeh Kishi, the initiative's chief research officer, said local officials \"across the spectrum\" have faced threats and violence \u2014 including those who hold nonpartisan offices.",
      "She believes politicians hold some responsibility to cool hostilities \u2014 including by avoiding baselessly casting blame.",
      "\"We really need leaders across the political spectrum to refuse calls for retribution [and] refrain from further normalizing violence,\" she said. \"Blaming whole groups of people or whole sides of the political spectrum is what really risks broader violence.\"",

      "Mr. Trump underwent a second examination\u00a0in early October \u2014 six months after a physical in April \u2014 just before departing for the Middle East. It's not clear if he had the MRI for preventative reasons or if there was a specific concern that prompted the scan. The president was asked if he received an MRI as a part of the \"advanced imaging\" his physician said he received at Walter Reed.",
      "\"I did, I got an MRI, it was perfect, yep,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, en route to Tokyo during\u00a0his Asia tour, adding, \"I gave you the full results. We had an MRI and the machine, you know, the whole thing, and it was perfect.\"",
      "Asked what the doctors were looking for, Mr. Trump responded, \"You could ask the doctors. In fact, we have doctors traveling with us. But I think they gave you a very conclusive \u2014 nobody has ever given you reports like I gave you.\"",

      "The president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbarella, said in a memo after Mr. Trump's checkup that he was in excellent health and his cardiac age \"was found to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 13:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he will consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states,\u00a0including a visit this past July to South Carolina,\u00a0which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is\u00a0on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure\u00a0he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department\u00a0said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "While Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of\u00a0Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.",
      "Newsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden\u00a0dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.",
      "Speaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.",
      "\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.",
      "According to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a\u00a0fearsome Category 5 storm, bringing heavy floodwaters across the country's southwest and catastrophic winds that tore roofs off buildings.",
      "The most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago and one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Melissa struck Jamaica with sustained winds of 185 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its 8 p.m. ET update that winds had decreased to 125 mph, now a Category 3 speed.",
      "The storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",
      "More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie. A section of the roof of Black River Hospital in southwestern Jamaica was damaged by the storm, and the hospital evacuated 75 patients, McKenzie said during a news conference.",
      "Melissa was expected to continue its path over Jamaica and be over southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, still as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, the NHC said. It could then reach the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, still as a hurricane.",
      "\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,\" World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said. She told reporters in Geneva that she expects catastrophic damage on the island, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Melissa could affect 1.5 million people in Jamaica, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies official Necephor Mghendi said in Geneva, warning there will be a \"massive impact,\" French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it, too, warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Melissa is forecast to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the hurricane center warned.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the hurricane center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, \"and [we] hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm was already blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",
      "In Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Camaguey province. Cuban officials said Monday that they were evacuating more than 600,000 people from the eastern region of the country, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city.",
      "Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas on Monday, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.",

    "summary": "A Florida couple traveled to Colombia to make their dream of a family a reality through the booming \"fertility tourism\" business.",
    "story": [
      "After two years of trying to get pregnant, Maggie Quinn and Ricardo Escobar faced a financial obstacle they hadn't expected: the cost of in vitro fertilization in the United States.",
      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",
      "\"It's a blessing, really,\" Escobar said. \"Being able to have the first one, and then being able to give our first boy a brother is, is just a blessing.\"",

      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A record 2023 heat wave all but eradicated two species of coral that historically served as the backbone of Florida's reefs, researchers said in a new report.",
    "story": [
      "A record-setting marine heat wave stripped huge portions of Florida's coral reef of their colors in 2023, triggering the ninth and worst mass bleaching event in the Caribbean. Temperatures soared for weeks, almost completely killing off two of the region's oldest and most important coral species, according to a new report that aims to shine a light on how warming waters can be lethal for the ecosystems they've historically sustained.",
      "Co-authored by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of South Florida and several nonprofit organizations, the report was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science. It shared striking findings from an investigation into the effects of that record heat wave on a 350-mile stretch of the Florida reef, which, researchers said, wilted as sea surface temperatures remained at or above 31 degrees Celsius \u2014 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 for an average of 40.7 days over the summer.",
      "The heat stress in pockets of the reef during that time was as much as four times greater than it had been during any previous heat wave or any prior year that scientists recorded temperature data for the area, said Ross Cunning, one of the report's lead authors and a biologist at the Chicago-based Shedd Aquarium, whose research centers around ways to make coral reefs more resilient against the effects of climate change.",
      "Among the heat wave's most devastating impacts were the deaths of two types of coral, staghorn and elkhorn, which are known as \"reef builders\" because they have provided the structural foundation from which Caribbean reef ecosystems can grow for thousands of years. According to the report, between 97.8% and 100% of coral belonging to those two species perished in the heat wave, marking what researchers characterized as \"their functional extinction from the region.\"",
      "\"Functional extinction\" means there is no longer enough of either coral species in the Caribbean in order for staghorn or elkhorn to continue performing their longstanding services to the reef at large.",
      "\"These corals are the ecosystem engineers of reefs,\" Cunning told CBS News. \"They literally build the three-dimensional framework that we know as the coral reef.\"",
      "Cunning likened the \"huge losses\" felt by the Caribbean reef in their absence to those a diverse forest might suffer after losing its largest and most vital trees: \"What you're left with is a range of smaller trees and shrubs and other plants, and they'll continue to grow and form together some type of forest,\" he said, \"but it's a forest transformed without these major contributors.\"",
      "The 2023 heat wave in Florida's reef has been\u00a0described as a bleaching event, when corals purge their colorful algae and appear white and brittle in response to warming oceans. Bleaching robs coral of nutrition and makes them more susceptible to disease, which kills them over the long term. But the circumstances in this case were so severe that they actually accelerated that process in some of the affected reefs, said John Parkinson, a professor at the University of South Florida who specializes in marine ecology and is another co-author of the new report.",
      "\"Coral bleaching is definitely a problem, but some of these corals didn't even get a chance to bleach,\" Parkinson told CBS News. \"They actually just started melting. Essentially, they were sloughing their tissue.\"",
      "Damages felt in the wake of the 2023 heat wave are most likely permanent, researchers said. A stark example of the warning call from climate scientists at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England, who earlier this month released a report of their own that found\u00a0coral reefs\u00a0had become the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" as global warming has increased ocean temperatures around the world.",
      "Around 25% of all marine life depend on coral reefs for protection and habitats, while the Global Systems Institute estimated that reefs provide crucial support for about 1 billion jobs. Climate scientists have also noted how reefs, in Florida and elsewhere, help shield coastlines and the communities that populate them from things like storm surge, flooding and erosion.",
      "Scientists expect heat waves to become more intense and more common without stronger efforts to reduce the prevalence of fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas emissions that linger in the atmosphere after burning them. In their new report in Science, the co-authors wrote, \"the frequency and severity of extreme climate and weather events, including marine heat waves, are increasing, resulting in widespread degradation of the function, structure, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems.\"",
      "Those aren't reasons to lose hope for a brighter future, they said. While Parkinson referred to the record heat wave as \"devastating\" and \"off the charts,\" he also told CBS News that he likes to remain optimistic about the possibility that things will change for the better.",
      "\"You know, some corals survived, and the people who are involved in restoration are still going at it, and we're still trying to keep corals around,\" he said. \"We all believe that we can, but we really need help from the people who have the power to adjust our approach to these climate policies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump heads Wednesday to Gyeongju, South Korea, for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to address the summit Wednesday morning, local time, and meet with Xi a day later. He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant partners with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for more access to China's market.",
      "The stop marks the final leg of his Asia tour, after visits to Malaysia and Japan in a five-day swing that's largely been focused on trade and economic ties in the South Pacific. Mr. Trump is aiming to cement trade deals and extract tariffs from other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that additional 100% tariffs that Mr. Trump had threatened on Chinese goods were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "Gyeongju, with a population of about 250,000 in southeastern Korea, sits on the opposite side of the country as Seoul, the nation's capital, and thus, is farther from neighboring North Korea. Mr. Trump has said he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, but no such meeting has been planned. In Mr. Trump's first term, he became the first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after he put an invitation to Kim on social media.",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, with promoting free trade being a major component of the forum \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries. APEC members include China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "Before leaving Tokyo, Mr. Trump also signed a trade deal with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry. And the president announced trade frameworks with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with China's Xi could be a tense one, as the two world powers have clashed on trade and tariffs for months.",
      "The president is pressing Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace, threatening 100% tariffs starting Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "The trade war has also led China to cut off purchases of U.S. soybeans, hitting American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday he expects the soybean boycott to end. And Mr. Trump needs Chinese approval for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent ByteDance.",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a Category 5 storm and is expected to bring \"catastrophic winds, flash flooding and storm surge,\" forecasters say.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica\u00a0as a fierce Category 5 storm, making landfall Tuesday afternoon as one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.",
      "\"This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "Melissa is expected to bring \"catastrophic winds, flash flooding and storm surge,\" especially to the western part of the island, before moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas.",
      "Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it has turned into the strongest Atlantic system this season and is tied for the second-strongest on record in terms of wind speed.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm made landfall along Jamaica's southwestern coast at around 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Melissa's wind speeds were later clocked at 125 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane, the hurricane center said in an 8 p.m. update. The storm was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph.",
      "With the NHC's latest update, the storm was located about 50 miles east-northeast of Jamaica's Montego Bay and about 160 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba.",
      "Peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica, 8 to 12 feet in Cuba, 5 to 8 feet in the southeastern Bahamas, and 2 to 4 feet in normally dry ground of Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica.\"",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound the island was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin, as well as the southeastern and central Bahamas.",
      "A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda.",
      "A tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti, the Cuban province of Las Tunas and Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving \"non-mission-essential\" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa. About 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the center emphasized.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots through Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding. Turks and Caicos Islands could see up to 4 inches of rain.",
      "In the Bahamas, forecasters said, a total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding. For Bermuda, heavy rain is expected Thursday night.",
      "Climate change fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told The AP.",

      "Jurors began deliberating late Tuesday morning in the murder trial for\u00a0former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0Sean Grayson, in the shooting death of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman who had called police for help.",
      "The jury received the case following closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys.",
      "In court on Tuesday, prosecutors held Massey's cooking pot up for the jury and sarcastically said, \"This is the dangerous pot that Sean Grayson was so afraid of.\"",
      "Prosecutors also for the second time showed unedited camera footage in court. Massey's family was visibly emotional and upset, and a juror wiped away tears as she cried while watching the video.",
      "In July 2024, Massey called 911 to report a prowler. Grayson was among the officers who responded.",
      "During their interaction, Massey walked towards a pot of water on the stove. Massey told officers, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before the officers pulled out their weapons, yelling for her to drop the pot. That's when Grayson shot Massey.",
      "Grayson, who faces three counts of first-degree murder, took the stand on Monday and offered his version of events. When he and his partner arrived at Massey's home in the Springfield area on July 6, 2024, Grayson's body-worn camera was not on.",
      "\"I should have turned it on when I saw the broken windows of the car outside,\" Grayson told jurors.",
      "Grayson said that the broken window, Massey's call for help, and having to wait four minutes for Massey to answer the door made him concerned that someone else could have been in the house.",
      "He also claimed, \"I believed she was possibly under the influence of something,\" and said that she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",
      "He said he turned his camera on as he began to question her. He testified that Massey had a pot of boiling water on the stove, and told the jury that he was scared of being hit with boiling hot water inside the pot, and when Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he perceived that as a threat and opened fire.",
      "\"I saw the bottom of the pot was turning red, so it seemed very hot,\" he said. \"Then she picked up the pot and walked towards me. \u2026 I wasn't quite sure what she was going to do.\"",
      "Grayson said Massey asked, \"Where are you going?\" and he responded, \"Away from your hot steaming water.\"",
      "\"I took it as a threat,\" he said. \"It raises a lot of concern for me, and I believe she's going to throw the water. \u2026 We were trained to use force that's going to gain compliance.\"",
      "Grayson said he was equipped with a Taser, but testified, \"She was wearing layers and both prongs have to stick in for the Taser to work.\"",
      "Grayson's attorneys during the trial called Massey the aggressor and accused her of escalating the encounter, leaving the former deputy with no other options.",
      "During closing arguments, Grayson's attorneys instructed the jury that this case is not a question of who shot and killed Massey\u2014rather, it's a question of whether or not Grayson was justified to do so under Illinois law. State prosecutors painted a picture of Grayson as a man trying to control the entire situation, but was unable to control himself and his own emotions the night he killed Massey.",
      "Jurors last week heard from Grayson's partner,\u00a0who said he wasn't afraid of Massey\u00a0but said he was afraid of Grayson.",
      "The\u00a0jury was selected for the trial\u00a0last week and is made up of nine women and three men. One juror is Black.",

That's the difference between being found guilty of potentially first-degree murder and second-degree murder.\u00a0 If the belief was unreasonable, that will be second-degree murder,\" Miller said.",
      "In August,\u00a0Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Sonya Massey Bill, which requires more thorough background checks for officers in the state.",

      "Monkeys that were being transported Tuesday on a Mississippi highway escaped after the truck carrying them overturned, and all but one have since been killed, authorities said.",
      "The crash happened approximately 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson. It's not clear what caused the truck to overturn. Video showed monkeys crawling through the tall grass on the side of Interstate 59 just north of Heidelberg, Mississippi, with wooden crates labeled \"live animals\" crumpled and strewn about.",
      "The Jasper County Sheriff's Department said the rhesus monkeys were from Tulane University, and initially wrote in a post on Facebook that \"they are aggressive to humans and they require PPE to handle.\" It's not clear how many monkeys were originally in the truck or how many were killed. The sheriff's department later said the driver of the truck relayed that \"the monkeys were dangerous and posed a threat to humans,\" and that it took \"appropriate actions after being given that information.\"",
      "Rhesus monkeys, which typically weigh around 16 pounds, are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. The escaped monkeys carry diseases but were not infectious, authorities said. They were being housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university.",
      "The monkeys \"are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery,\" a Tulane University spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.\"",
      "Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries is also on site, according to the sheriff's department. It's not clear who the monkeys belong to or where they were going.",
      "Rhesus macaque primates have brown fur with red faces and ears. They have close-cropped hair on their heads, which accentuates their very expressive faces. Rhesus macaques were imported to the United States in the 1970s for biomedical research in laboratories, according to the\u00a0New England Primate Conservancy. Rhesus macaques are \"bold, extremely curious and adventurous monkeys,\" and the species is \"highly adaptable to coexisting alongside humans,\" the conservancy says.",

      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

    "story": [
      "A Florida man convicted of raping and killing his next-door neighbor was executed Tuesday evening, the state's 15th execution this year.",
      "Florida has executed more people\u00a0than any other state this year, followed by Texas and Alabama with five executions each.",
      "Norman Mearle Grim Jr., 65, died by lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke at 6:14 p.m., according to the state's Department of Corrections. He was convicted of sexual battery and first-degree murder and sentenced to death for the 1998 killing of his neighbor, Cynthia Campbell.",
      "Campbell was reported missing in 1998, and her battered body was later found off the Pensacola Bay Bridge by a fisherman. Prosecutors said Campbell had suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her face and head that were consistent with being struck by a hammer, as well as 11 stab wounds in the chest. An autopsy revealed seven of the stab wounds penetrated her heart. Physical evidence, including DNA, tied Grim to her killing, and he was convicted in December 2000 and sentenced to death.",
      "After a death warrant is signed and an execution date is set, inmates have a last chance to appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. But Grim waived any appeals during a hearing earlier this month.",
      "On Tuesday, Grim awoke at 6 a.m. and later had a meal of fried pork chops and mashed potatoes with a chocolate milkshake and pie, according to Department of Corrections spokesman Ted Veerman. The spokesman said Grim did not meet with a spiritual adviser or any visitors ahead of his scheduled evening execution.",
      "A total of 40 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and at least 18 other people are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year.",
      "Two more executions are planned for next month in Florida under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "Bryan Fredrick Jennings, 66, is scheduled for Florida's 16th execution on Nov. 13. He was convicted of raping and killing a 6-year-old girl in 1979 after entering through a window and abducting her from her central Florida home. Richard Barry Randolph, 63, is set for Florida's 17th execution on Nov. 20. He was convicted of the 1988 rape and fatal beating of his former manager at a Florida convenience store.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest execution tally on record for the state had been eight people in 2014.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ups-layoffs-labor-market-jobs-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:17:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring when announcing the central bank's first rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate is still low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

      "At a press conference on Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted air traffic controllers' financial struggles\u00a0as they go without pay.",
      "\"This is day one,\" he said of controllers missing their first full paychecks. \"Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].\"",
      "Duffy also noted that controllers are calling in sick in larger numbers than usual, as some seek side gigs with companies like\u00a0Uber or DoorDash\u00a0to make ends meet\u00a0during the shutdown.",
      "Speaking at the same event, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels also emphasized the financial pressure on his members.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "On average this year, 5% of flight delays were attributed to air traffic controller shortages, Duffy said. The personnel shortages at some airports were responsible for roughly 44% of the\u00a08,700 flight delays\u00a0on Sunday, while accounting for 24% of Monday's delays, according to Duffy.",
      "Controllers were planning to gather outside at least 17 airports nationwide on Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown, according to The Associated Press.",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's lawyers on Monday filed their long-promised appeal of the Manhattan \"hush money\" criminal case that led to his felony conviction.",
      "The president's attorneys echoed arguments that Mr. Trump and his trial counsel made repeatedly throughout the proceedings in the spring of 2024. They said the case should not have been brought, the judge should have recused himself because he had previously made small donations to Democratic causes. They also argued the conviction should be discarded due to the Supreme Court's July 2024 ruling on presidential immunity. That decision was tied to another of Mr. Trump's criminal cases, but his lawyers said it has a bearing on Mr. Trump's conviction in the New York case. Many of these same arguments were rejected during the criminal trial in Manhattan.",
      "\"This case should have never seen the inside of a courtroom, let alone resulted in a jury conviction,\" the lawyers, led by Robert Giuffra Jr., wrote in the 96-page filing.",
      "The appeal is part of a multi-pronged effort by Mr. Trump to attempt to overturn the conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has also asked a federal appeals court to transfer his state case to federal court.",
      "The case revolved around Mr. Trump's efforts to cover up so-called \"hush money\" payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued during the trial that Mr. Trump, through his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election to suppress her story of an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The jury concluded that Mr. Trump authorized an effort to falsify records related to reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for that payment.",
      "The trial played out over seven weeks last spring, in effect relegating Mr. Trump's third presidential campaign to hallway gaggles outside the courtroom. As Mr. Trump himself did regularly before, during and after the trial, his lawyers accused Bragg on Monday of bringing the case for political gain.",
      "\"The DA, a Democrat, brought those charges in the middle of a contentious presidential election in which President Trump was the leading Republican candidate. These charges against President Trump were as unprecedented as their political context,\" Mr. Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "Bragg's office declined to comment on Mr. Trump's filing.",
      "Days before his return to the White House in January, Mr. Trump received a no-jail sentence. His felony criminal conviction, however, remains on the books unless the jury's verdict is overturned.",
      "Mr. Trump's lead attorney during the trial, Todd Blanche, is now the deputy U.S. attorney general. Another lawyer from his trial team, Emil Bove III, was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.",

    "summary": "Tylenol maker Kenvue said Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation.",
    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson, claiming the use of Tylenol leads to higher risk of autism and that the over-the-counter drug is deceptively marketed to pregnant women as safe.",
      "Many medical experts have disputed such claims.",
      "The lawsuit, dated Monday, alleges Johnson & Johnson and Tylenol maker Kenvue, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, knew for decades \"that acetaminophen \u2014 Tylenol's active ingredient \u2014 is dangerous to unborn children and young children. Yet they hid this danger and deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women.\"",
      "In the lawsuit, Paxton pointed to the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen's risks, saying that: \"the federal government confirmed what Defendants knew for years: acetaminophen use during pregnancy likely causes conditions like [autism] and [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder].\"",
      "Paxton also accused Johnson & Johnson of transferring its liabilities arising from Tylenol to Kenvue in order to shield its assets from potential lawsuits related to Tylenol and its alleged \"harmful impact\" on children.",
      "Kenvue said in a statement that Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation. It maintained that acetaminophen \"is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "\"We are deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children,\" Kenvue said.",
      "Kenvue also warned that failing to treat fevers and other ailments with acetaminophen could also expose pregnant women to health risks.",
      "\"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives,\" Kenvue's statement continued. \"High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.\"",
      "A Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News: \"Johnson & Johnson divested its consumer health business years ago, and all rights and liabilities associated with the sale of its over-the-counter products, including Tylenol (acetaminophen), are owned by Kenvue.\"",
      "In September, President Trump, standing alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.\u00a0 Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0announced\u00a0the FDA would immediately notify physicians \"that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.\"",
      "Kennedy said the FDA based its decision on studies that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including\u00a0one study\u00a0in the public health journal Environmental Health. He added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "After the Trump administration issued its warning about Tylenol, many top medical experts in the field\u00a0stressed\u00a0that scientific evidence does not support such concerns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is shaking up ICE's leadership, with plans to reassign as many as a dozen local leaders, as the agency faces pressure to ramp up arrests, sources told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.",
      "The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.",
      "In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.",
      "The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities \u2014 including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes \u2014 have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, \"The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.\"",
      "The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.",
      "Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities \u2014 and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.",
      "\"We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,\" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.",
      "Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.",
      "In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open.",
      "\"Some partners haven't been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said. \"We're delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\"",
      "Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings.",
      "\"When a clinic can't process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\"",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-jim-farley-on-steering-ford-through-trumps-tariffs/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything.

      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather.

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he will consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states,\u00a0including a visit this past July to South Carolina,\u00a0which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is\u00a0on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure\u00a0he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department\u00a0said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "While Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of\u00a0Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.",
      "Newsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden\u00a0dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.",
      "Speaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.",
      "\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.",
      "According to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

    "story": [
      "The White House may be the most well-known home in Washington D.C., but just blocks away from the presidential mansion sits a lesser-known home with its own piece of U.S. history.",
      "The Octagon is an approximately 10,000-square-foot home designed by William Thornton, who served as the first architect of the U.S. Capitol. The building sits at the corner of New York Avenue NW and 18th Street NW in Washington, D.C., and was completed in 1801.",
      "Built as a second residence for Virginia's prominent Tayloe family who were friends of George Washington, the more than 200-year-old building gets its name from the shape of the main room at the main entrance. Amanda Ferrario is the manager of the house, which now doubles as a museum and event space. It's owned and maintained by the Architects Foundation, the philanthropic partner of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), which purchased the property in 1902.",
      "\"The Octagon name comes from this room that we're standing in,\" Ferrario told CBS News during a tour of the home. \"In order to build a circular room, you make the structure out of an octagonal shape and then builds it in with various building materials to give this nice smooth circle,\" she added.",
      "Ferrario says the epicenter of the house was in the basement, where several enslaved people lived and worked mostly out of sight of the wealthy occupants.",
      "\"(The basement) is the absolute epicenter of all of the activity,\" Ferrario said. \"Not only for the enslaved who would live and work here, they were sleeping here. They were working here around the clock, but also in order to operate a house of this caliber,\" she added.",
      "The Octagon also served as a home for one of America's early first families. President James Madison and his wife, Dolley Madison, temporarily relocated to the home after the British burned down the White House in 1814. Ferrario says the rent for the temporary stay was about $6,000 for their 6-month stay. She also noted the specific reason why the British did not destroy the prominent home.",
      "\"But during this time, Mr. Tayloe was quite savvy, and invited a French ambassador to stay here. He knew that if there was a French flag flying, no one's going to touch this house,\" Ferrario said. \"And it was spared, and rightfully so, because in preparation for the British coming. And Dolley Madison did send over a few of her items that meant a lot to her, so that they would be extra protected.\"",
      "President Madison used the residence to conduct official business including signing the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812. He signed the document in the home's circular office, Ferrario told CBS News.",
      "Dolley Madison brought cherished items from the White House including curtains, silverware and her pet bird.\u00a0 The former first lady would go on to host what became known as \"squeezes\" in the first floor sitting room. The events were gatherings of Washington's elite at the time.",
      "Over the years, The Octagon was transformed for different uses, including a Catholic school for girls, a federal office building and later as tenement housing.",
      "Its storied past includes spooky and unexplained events reported by guests throughout the building's lifetime. Doors opening, lights flickering and security alarms going off without any explanation have been common occurrences in the building.",
      "\"We have an ongoing, I guess it's kind of an ongoing joke with our security monitoring company, that if the security monitors go off on the second or third floor, everything is okay. It's just our friends playing.\"",
      "Ferrario also says Jackie Kennedy Onassis \u2014 then known as Jackie Bouvier \u2014 may have had her own chilling experience in the home when she was working for a local newspaper.",
      "\"She wrote about a time when she came through to the Octagon and she was standing right where you're standing,\" Ferrario explained to CBS News. \"And she felt the overwhelming presence and a smell of lilac, which is equated to Dolley (Madison). And what she said was, it was like a former first lady looking over the shoulder of a future first lady.\"",
      "The building is currently undergoing renovations to become a prominent and cohesive part of the new headquarters for the AIA later this year. The house will also play a part in America's 250th Independence celebration after receiving a National Park Service grant for restoration efforts.",
      "Jennifer Calvert Hall serves as the Executive Director of the Architects Foundation. She hopes future visitors gain a sense of reverence for the architecture of America's early history.",
      "\"I want them to have this sense of that moment in time where our founding, sort of the people who founded the United States of America, were interested in very progressive ideas, and that those progressive ideas were reflected in its architecture. I want them to feel that,\" Calvert Hall said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-coral-reef-functionally-extinct-marine-heat-wave/",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A record 2023 heat wave all but eradicated two species of coral that historically served as the backbone of Florida's reefs, researchers said in a new report.",
    "story": [
      "A record-setting marine heat wave stripped huge portions of Florida's coral reef of their colors in 2023, triggering the ninth and worst mass bleaching event in the Caribbean. Temperatures soared for weeks, almost completely killing off two of the region's oldest and most important coral species, according to a new report that aims to shine a light on how warming waters can be lethal for the ecosystems they've historically sustained.",
      "Co-authored by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of South Florida and several nonprofit organizations, the report was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science. It shared striking findings from an investigation into the effects of that record heat wave on a 350-mile stretch of the Florida reef, which, researchers said, wilted as sea surface temperatures remained at or above 31 degrees Celsius \u2014 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 for an average of 40.7 days over the summer.",
      "The heat stress in pockets of the reef during that time was as much as four times greater than it had been during any previous heat wave or any prior year that scientists recorded temperature data for the area, said Ross Cunning, one of the report's lead authors and a biologist at the Chicago-based Shedd Aquarium, whose research centers around ways to make coral reefs more resilient against the effects of climate change.",
      "Among the heat wave's most devastating impacts were the deaths of two types of coral, staghorn and elkhorn, which are known as \"reef builders\" because they have provided the structural foundation from which Caribbean reef ecosystems can grow for thousands of years. According to the report, between 97.8% and 100% of coral belonging to those two species perished in the heat wave, marking what researchers characterized as \"their functional extinction from the region.\"",
      "\"Functional extinction\" means there is no longer enough of either coral species in the Caribbean in order for staghorn or elkhorn to continue performing their longstanding services to the reef at large.",
      "\"These corals are the ecosystem engineers of reefs,\" Cunning told CBS News. \"They literally build the three-dimensional framework that we know as the coral reef.\"",
      "Cunning likened the \"huge losses\" felt by the Caribbean reef in their absence to those a diverse forest might suffer after losing its largest and most vital trees: \"What you're left with is a range of smaller trees and shrubs and other plants, and they'll continue to grow and form together some type of forest,\" he said, \"but it's a forest transformed without these major contributors.\"",
      "The 2023 heat wave in Florida's reef has been\u00a0described as a bleaching event, when corals purge their colorful algae and appear white and brittle in response to warming oceans. Bleaching robs coral of nutrition and makes them more susceptible to disease, which kills them over the long term. But the circumstances in this case were so severe that they actually accelerated that process in some of the affected reefs, said John Parkinson, a professor at the University of South Florida who specializes in marine ecology and is another co-author of the new report.",
      "\"Coral bleaching is definitely a problem, but some of these corals didn't even get a chance to bleach,\" Parkinson told CBS News. \"They actually just started melting. Essentially, they were sloughing their tissue.\"",
      "Damages felt in the wake of the 2023 heat wave are most likely permanent, researchers said. A stark example of the warning call from climate scientists at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England, who earlier this month released a report of their own that found\u00a0coral reefs\u00a0had become the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" as global warming has increased ocean temperatures around the world.",
      "Around 25% of all marine life depend on coral reefs for protection and habitats, while the Global Systems Institute estimated that reefs provide crucial support for about 1 billion jobs. Climate scientists have also noted how reefs, in Florida and elsewhere, help shield coastlines and the communities that populate them from things like storm surge, flooding and erosion.",
      "Scientists expect heat waves to become more intense and more common without stronger efforts to reduce the prevalence of fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas emissions that linger in the atmosphere after burning them. In their new report in Science, the co-authors wrote, \"the frequency and severity of extreme climate and weather events, including marine heat waves, are increasing, resulting in widespread degradation of the function, structure, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems.\"",
      "Those aren't reasons to lose hope for a brighter future, they said. While Parkinson referred to the record heat wave as \"devastating\" and \"off the charts,\" he also told CBS News that he likes to remain optimistic about the possibility that things will change for the better.",
      "\"You know, some corals survived, and the people who are involved in restoration are still going at it, and we're still trying to keep corals around,\" he said. \"We all believe that we can, but we really need help from the people who have the power to adjust our approach to these climate policies.\"",

      "Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a\u00a0fearsome Category 5 storm, bringing heavy floodwaters across the country's southwest and catastrophic winds that tore roofs off buildings.",
      "The most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago and one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Melissa struck Jamaica with sustained winds of 185 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its 8 p.m. ET update that winds had decreased to 125 mph, now a Category 3 speed.",
      "The storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",
      "More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie. A section of the roof of Black River Hospital in southwestern Jamaica was damaged by the storm, and the hospital evacuated 75 patients, McKenzie said during a news conference.",
      "Melissa was expected to continue its path over Jamaica and be over southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, still as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, the NHC said. It could then reach the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, still as a hurricane.",
      "\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,\" World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said. She told reporters in Geneva that she expects catastrophic damage on the island, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Melissa could affect 1.5 million people in Jamaica, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies official Necephor Mghendi said in Geneva, warning there will be a \"massive impact,\" French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it, too, warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Melissa is forecast to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the hurricane center warned.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the hurricane center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, \"and [we] hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm was already blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",
      "In Cuba, a hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Camaguey province. Cuban officials said Monday that they were evacuating more than 600,000 people from the eastern region of the country, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city.",
      "Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas on Monday, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.",
      "And CBS News confirmed that a Hurricane Hunters aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was forced on Monday to abort its mission when it experienced \"severe turbulence\" in the storm's southwestern eyewall.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump heads Wednesday to Gyeongju, South Korea, for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to address the summit Wednesday morning, local time, and meet with Xi a day later. He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant partners with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for more access to China's market.",
      "The stop marks the final leg of his Asia tour, after visits to Malaysia and Japan in a five-day swing that's largely been focused on trade and economic ties in the South Pacific. Mr. Trump is aiming to cement trade deals and extract tariffs from other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that additional 100% tariffs that Mr. Trump had threatened on Chinese goods were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "Gyeongju, with a population of about 250,000 in southeastern Korea, sits on the opposite side of the country as Seoul, the nation's capital, and thus, is farther from neighboring North Korea. Mr. Trump has said he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, but no such meeting has been planned. In Mr. Trump's first term, he became the first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after he put an invitation to Kim on social media.",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, with promoting free trade being a major component of the forum \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries. APEC members include China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "Before leaving Tokyo, Mr. Trump also signed a trade deal with new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry. And the president announced trade frameworks with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with China's Xi could be a tense one, as the two world powers have clashed on trade and tariffs for months.",
      "The president is pressing Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace, threatening 100% tariffs starting Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "The trade war has also led China to cut off purchases of U.S. soybeans, hitting American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday he expects the soybean boycott to end. And Mr. Trump needs Chinese approval for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent ByteDance.",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica\u00a0as a fierce Category 5 storm, making landfall Tuesday afternoon as one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.",
      "\"This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "Melissa is expected to bring \"catastrophic winds, flash flooding and storm surge,\" especially to the western part of the island, before moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas.",
      "Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it has turned into the strongest Atlantic system this season and is tied for the second-strongest on record in terms of wind speed.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm made landfall along Jamaica's southwestern coast at around 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Melissa's wind speeds were later clocked at 125 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane, the hurricane center said in an 8 p.m. update. The storm was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph.",
      "With the NHC's latest update, the storm was located about 50 miles east-northeast of Jamaica's Montego Bay and about 160 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba.",
      "Peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica, 8 to 12 feet in Cuba, 5 to 8 feet in the southeastern Bahamas, and 2 to 4 feet in normally dry ground of Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica.\"",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound the island was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin, as well as the southeastern and central Bahamas.",
      "A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda.",
      "A tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti, the Cuban province of Las Tunas and Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving \"non-mission-essential\" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa. About 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the center emphasized.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots through Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding. Turks and Caicos Islands could see up to 4 inches of rain.",
      "In the Bahamas, forecasters said, a total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding. For Bermuda, heavy rain is expected Thursday night.",
      "Climate change fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told The AP.",

      "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
      "In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, \"People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future.\" Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while \"diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world.\"",
      "The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to innovate and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development \u2014 \"programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change.\" He argued for putting \"human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,\" including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.",
      "In years past, Gates, the author of \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" struck a more alarmist tone.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: \"If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature.\" He added, \"You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later.\"",
      "Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that same year that climate change is \"way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented.\"",
      "Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce carbon emissions.",
      "Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.",
      "Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world.",
      "\"Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a \"breathtaking misread\" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.",
      "\"I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for \u2014 the global poor.\"",
      "Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.",
      "\"Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously,\" he said. \"There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame.\"",
      "Gallaudet believes moving away from \"climate doomsday alarmism\" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.",
      "Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.",
      "In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon \"don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.\"",
      "Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere.",
      "\"We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones,\" he told CBS News. \"I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient.\"",
      "With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.",
      "\"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he has ordered the army to immediately carry out \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza, and Hamas responded by saying it would delay handing over the body of a hostage, putting new pressure on the tenuous U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Associated Press reporters and witnesses heard tank fire and saw explosions in various parts of Gaza, including in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the\u00a0[Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn't been an official announcement yet.",
      "There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it had recovered the body of a hostage, but after Netanyahu announced the plans to strike Gaza, Hamas said in a statement it would delay the handover.",
      "An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.",
      "The slow return of hostages' bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas Tuesday of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "This is the second time since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.",
      "During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas' body was returned a day later.",
      "The remains returned overnight have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu's office said.",
      "Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.",
      "Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.",
      "Tzarfati's family said in a statement that this is the third time \"we have been forced to open Ofir's grave and rebury our son.\"",
      "In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel's stepped-up military activity in the territory since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.",
      "Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants \"took part in terror activity in Jenin,\" but gave no further details.",
      "Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.",
      "An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.",
      "Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a \"comrade,\" but no additional details about him were given.",
      "Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.",
      "Over 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.",

      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, Mr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",
      "They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before smiling for a photo together, then walked inside the palace for a roughly half-hour meeting that the White House described as a \"courtesy call.\"",

      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",

      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",

      "Israel's government said Tuesday that a set of partial hostage remains returned by Hamas the previous day belonged to a deceased hostage recovered by the military around two years ago, not one of those whose remains are still missing in Gaza. The prime minister's office called it a violation of the U.S.-brokered peace deal, and said it was considering its response.",
      "\"After completing the identification process this morning, it was found that last night remains belonging to the fallen hostage Ofir Tzarfati, who had been returned from the Gaza Strip in a military operation about two years ago, were returned,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the [Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "Israeli media reported the meeting between Netanyahu and his top security chiefs had concluded without any firm decisions taken about next steps. Veteran journalist Barak Ravid, with Israel's Channel 12, said Netanyahu had told his senior aides that any response would have to be discussed with the Trump administration.",
      "An Israeli group campaigning for the release of hostages held in Gaza urged authorities to \"act decisively\" against Hamas, accusing the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group of violating the peace deal brokered by President Trump by returning only the partial remains of the previously recovered hostage, Tzarfati, rather than one of the 13 whose bodies remain in Gaza.",
      "\"In light of Hamas' severe breach of the agreement last night ... the Israeli government cannot and must not ignore this, and must act decisively against these violations,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many of the hostage families, said in a statement.",
      "The forum has urged Israel's leaders to declare Hamas in breach of the peace deal since it started handing over the remains of 28 deceased hostages that had been held in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Later Tuesday the Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "The IDF did not identify the remains involved in the incident, but the family of Tzarfati released a statement saying they were his.",
      "In a statement shared by the hostage families forum, the Tzarfati family said Hamas had inflicted a deception \"upon our family as we try to heal.\"",
      "\"This morning we were shown video footage of our beloved son's remains being removed, buried, and handed over to the Red Cross \u2014 an abhorrent manipulation designed to sabotage the deal and abandon the effort to bring all the hostages home,\" the family was quoted as saying.",
      "Hamas did not have an immediate response to that allegation, but it has said it needs more time, assistance and heavy equipment to locate and recover the remaining 13 bodies still in the Palestinian territory, and that work has ramped up in recent days, with Egypt sending a team to assist and help coordinate, and the Red Cross confirming to CBS News on Monday that its staff were accompanying recovery teams on the ground.",
      "President Trump warned on Saturday that he was \"watching very closely\" to ensure that Hamas returned more bodies within 48 hours.",
      "\"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not,\" he wrote on his Truth Social network.",
      "Speaking with the Al Jazeera network on Tuesday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the group was communicating all logistical details about its effort to locate and retrieve hostage remains with a joint operations room established in Cairo. He said Hamas was updating the mediators on developments regularly and he accused Israel of obstructing the efforts by not allowing sufficient heavy equipment into Gaza to find and recover remains.",
      "Israel has permitted some digging machines into Gaza, and Al Jazeera aired live video on Tuesday that appeared to show a Hamas member emerging from a newly-cleared entrance to a tunnel in the southern city of Khan Younis holding several fingers up, possibly indicating that additional remains had been found.",
      "There was no immediate word from Hamas about the discovery of any additional bodies.",
      "\"Hamas is fully and completely committed to the ceasefire agreement on the Gaza Strip, which includes, among other things, the handover of Israeli captives \u2014 alive and dead,\" Qassem told Al Jazeera. \"Over the past period we have worked to hand over whatever remains of the captives' bodies are available. Now the occupation threatens and vows retaliation. It knows perfectly well that the obstacles preventing the retrieval of more bodies are caused by the occupation itself.\"",
      "He said Israel's two-year bombardment had \"destroyed the Gaza Strip and altered the landmarks of cities, streets and roads \u2014 all the markers the resistance [Hamas] could use to locate the remaining bodies,\" and accused Israel of using the incomplete handover of remains \"as a pretext to sustain its war\" in Gaza.",
      "In its statement on Tuesday, the IDF rejected Hamas' claims of a shortage of heavy equipment as false.",
      "It said such equipment \"is clearly unnecessary for the transfer of remains, and therefore these claims do not constitute an obstacle to the return of the remaining deceased hostages.\"",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",

      "An expedition to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.",
      "\"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too,\" Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. \"Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon.\"",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan\u00a0disappeared\u00a0while Earhart \u2014 flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra \u2014 tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.",
      "Researchers previously said there is \"very strong\" evidence that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said \"maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances.\"",
      "\"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The gunman accused of killing Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe pleaded guilty Tuesday, three years after the assassination in broad daylight shocked the world.",
      "The slaying forced a reckoning in a country with little experience of gun violence, and ignited scrutiny of alleged ties between prominent conservative lawmakers and a secretive sect, the Unification Church.",
      "\"Everything is true,\" Tetsuya Yamagami said at a court in the western city of Nara, admitting to the murder of the country's longest-serving leader in July 2022.",
      "\"There is no doubt that I have done all this,\" Yamagami added, according to the Japan Times.",
      "The 45-year-old was led handcuffed into the room with a rope around his waist.",
      "When the judge asked him to state his name, Yamagami, who was wearing a black T-shirt and had his long hair tied back, replied in a barely audible voice.",
      "His lawyer said they would contest certain charges, including violations of arms control laws for allegedly using a handmade weapon.",
      "More than 700 people lined up to be one of the 32 allowed in a lottery to sit in the courtroom's public gallery for the trial, the Japan Times reported.",
      "Yamagami pleaded guilty on the same day that two of Abe's former allies, incumbent Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and visiting U.S. President Donald Trump, met in Tokyo.",
      "Yamagami's trial had been a long time coming after the discovery of a suspicious item \u2014 later found to be harmless \u2014 caused its last-minute cancellation and the evacuation of the Nara court building in 2023.",
      "One issue central to the case was whether extenuating circumstances applied due to \"religious abuse\" in Yamagami's childhood stemming from his mother's extreme devotion to the Unification Church, according to Japanese media reports.",
      "In a recent interview with TBS News, cited by the Japan Times, she said her faith grew even stronger after the her son assassinated Abe.",
      "Prosecutors told the court that Yamagami started building up resentment toward the church, which he thinks derailed his life.",
      "\"He began to think he needed a gun\" to attack church executives, but having failed to procure one \"he decided that he had to make one himself,\" a prosecutor said.",
      "Yamagami \"thought he could draw public attention to the church ... if he killed someone as influential as Abe,\" the prosecutor said.",
      "Some Japanese expressed sympathy for Yamagami, especially those who also\u00a0suffered as children of followers of the Unification Church, which is known for pressuring adherents into making big donations and is considered a cult in Japan.",
      "The former prime minister had spoken at events organized by some of the church groups and received some criticism for doing so.",
      "\"Life was ruined by the church\"",
      "Yamagami reportedly resented Abe for his perceived ties to the Church, which was established in South Korea in 1954 and whose members are nicknamed \"Moonies\" after its founder Sun Myung Moon.",
      "The Church has been accused of fomenting child neglect among its members and financially exploiting them, claims it denies.",
      "Yamagami's lawyers on Tuesday said his life collapsed because of the sect, with his mother convinced \"throwing all her money and assets into the Church will salvage her family\" after the suicide of her husband and the illness of one of her sons.",
      "In the end, she donated around 100 million yen ($1 million at the time) to the sect, the lawyer said.",
      "Yamagami gave up on advancing to higher education and joined the military instead, while his mother declared bankruptcy, according to the lawyer.",
      "He also attempted suicide in 2005.",
      "\"He began to think his whole life was ruined by the church,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Investigations after Abe's murder led to cascading revelations about close ties between the Church and many conservative lawmakers in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, prompting four ministers to resign.",
      "Earlier this year, the Tokyo District Court issued a dissolution order for the Church's Japanese arm, saying it caused \"unprecedented damage\" to society.",
      "The assassination was also a wake-up call for a nation with some of the world's strictest gun controls.",
      "Gun violence is so rare in Japan that security officials at the scene failed to immediately identify the sound made by the first shot, and came to Abe's rescue too late, a police report after the attack said.",
      "The debacle prompted lawmakers to pass a bill in 2024 further strengthening arms controls to prevent people from making homemade guns.",
      "Under the new rules, uploading tutorial videos on making firearms and propagating information about gun sales on social media can result in a fine or imprisonment of up to one year.",

    "summary": "Trump meets Japan's new, first female prime minister, and they sign a bilateral trade deal before going together to greet troops on the USS George Washington.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000.",
      "She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",
      "Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening.",
      "On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo's imperial palace.",
      "Trump to visit South Korea next \u2014 and meet with China's Xi Jinping",
      "South Korea is the next and final stop on the president's trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2014 a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump also said he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are no such plans for a meeting.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa\u00a0intensified to Category 5 early Monday as it neared Jamaica, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding, landslides and widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. The storm is forecast to dump up to 30 inches of rain on Jamaica, along with life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast.",
      "Melissa is expected to make landfall on the island on Tuesday and cross southeastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday. The U.S. State Department on Monday issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.",
      "As of the National Hurricane Center's latest update, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph and was inching north-northeast\u00a0at a slow pace, just 2 mph.",
      "Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, for storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph \u2014 catastrophic strength capable of destroying many of the homes in its path.",
      "\"Destructive winds and storm surge and catastrophic flooding will worsen in Jamaica through the day and into tonight,\" CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said Monday.",
      "Melissa is expected to be the most powerful storm to ever hit Jamaica, and, potentially, the most powerful storm on record to ever make landfall anywhere, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said Monday. The storm's slow pace, which it was forecast to maintain while traversing Jamaica, increased the likelihood that it would bring \"profound\" devastation to the island, according to Gilmore.",
      "\"All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica over the next 36 hours,\" he said.",
      "Melissa forces Hurricane Hunters aircraft to turn around, NOAA says",
      "CBS News confirmed that a Hurricane Hunters aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was forced on Monday to abort its mission when it experienced \"severe turbulence\" in the storm's southwestern eyewall.",
      "The crew on one of NOAA's P-3 aircraft, the N42RF \"Kermit,\" experienced the turbulence, which triggered a mandatory maintenance action, and they had to return to the Aircraft Operations Center in Lakeland, Florida, a NOAA spokesman told CBS News. The aircraft underwent inspection and maintenance and was scheduled to continue with planned missions on Monday. Another of NOAA's P-3 aircraft, the N43RF \"Miss Piggy,\" was slated to support flights into Hurricane Melissa starting Tuesday.",
      "Storm surge in Jamaica could peak up to 13 feet, forecasters say",
      "In addition to the rainfall, Melissa is likely to cause a life-threatening storm surge on Jamaica's southern coast, peaking as much as 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall, forecasters said.",
      "Mandatory evacuations were ordered in seven flood-prone communities, where buses carried people to shelters, according to Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management there.",
      "In addition to the impact on Jamaica, western Haiti could get 16 inches of rain, bringing the threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides there, too, the hurricane center warned.",
      "The slow-moving storm has already killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing, according to authorities.",
      "\"I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,\" said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. \"Do not gamble with Melissa. It's not a safe bet.\"",
      "The hurricane was expected to make another landfall later Tuesday in eastern Cuba, where authorities have ordered some 650,000 people to evacuate, according to the country's president. A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.",
      "Around 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ahead of Melissa's arrival, a U.S. defense official told CBS News. Meanwhile, some U.S. Navy ships in the region were repositioned out of the hurricane's direct path but remained actively deployed, the official said.",
      "Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, also warned Melissa could be the strongest hurricane Jamaica has experienced in decades. He said cleanup and damage assessment could be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.",
      "\"Don't make foolish decisions,\" warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. \"We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.\"",
      "The storm has already dropped heavy rain in the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.",
      "Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the Dominican Republic, displacing more than 3,760 people and leaving more than half a million without drinking water services, emergency officials said. Floodwaters have also cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.",
      "In Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 37 acres of maize, at a time when at least 5.7 million people \u2014 more than half the country's population \u2014 are experiencing crisis-level hunger, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency-level hunger.",
      "\"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,\" the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization said.",

      "For decades, BMI (body mass index) has been the go-to number doctors use to decide whether someone is underweight, \"normal,\" overweight or obese.",
      "But new global research suggests it's possible to have a normal BMI, look thin in clothes and still meet the medical definition of obesity.",
      "A large study published in JAMA Network Open based on World Health Organization (WHO) survey data examined health data from more than 471,000 adults across 91 countries.",
      "RESEARCHERS SAY BEING 'FAT BUT FIT' COULD BE LESS DEADLY THAN BEING UNDERWEIGHT",
      "The researchers looked at people whose BMI fell in the normal range (18.5\u201324.9) but who carried extra fat around their midsection, measured by waist circumference.",
      "The results showed that roughly 1 in 5 people with a normal BMI had abdominal obesity, a large waistline linked to serious health risks.",

      "Benefits of NAD+",
      "Research has shown that boosting NAD+ can improve mitochondrial and stem cell function, improve energy metabolism, enhance focus and mood, and support tissue repair, according to Dr. Amanda Kahn, a board-certified internist and longevity expert in New York City.",
      "\"From a longevity standpoint, NAD+ is one of the most central molecules in maintaining youthful cellular function,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"It activates \u2026 longevity pathways that protect against DNA damage and inflammation.\"",

      "\"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance while supporting detoxification.\"",
      "\"Oral NAD precursors can modestly raise NAD+ levels and are convenient for daily maintenance,\" Kahn said. \"In contrast, injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery.\"",

      "Health start-up 'SpotitEarly' is using dogs to help sniff out the four most common types of cancer, helping people detect the disease early.",
      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

      "That year, the Ford originally departed for a deployment to Europe in May, but eventually spent the tail end of it in the Eastern Mediterranean after Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "Now, the Navy\u2019s most advanced carrier finds itself at the foreground of yet another critical conflict as it heads to the Caribbean amid President Donald Trump\u2019s crusade against drugs, which is exerting even more pressure on Venezuela.",

The carrier\u2019s command center for the ship is placed closer to the rear of the Ford to create more space on the flight deck, so more aircraft can be ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice.",
      "Additionally, the carrier is outfitted with a new electromagnetic aircraft launch system, or EMALS, which is designed to offload aircraft from the ship rather than using a steam-powered catapult system, like the ones installed on every other carrier.",
      "During its deployment to the Caribbean, the Ford likely will be conducting strike operations on land, and providing close air support for special operations troops, according to experts. While the new technologies aren\u2019t likely a huge game changer in the Caribbean conflict, the carrier\u2019s presence does give the U.S. military additional flexibility to conduct operations there, according to experts.",

Meanwhile, Trump routinely has said for weeks he is considering employing land operations against Venezuela, following his directed strikes at sea.",
      "\"The Ford\u2019s arrival in SOUTHCOM area is not unprecedented but given the ongoing attacks on Cartel boats significant. I see this move as intended to deter Venezuela from escalating the crisis and providing the President extra options should he want to increase the attacks on the Cartels,\" Sadler said in an email to Fox News Digital on Monday. \"That said, I would anticipate the Ford\u2019s air wing being very active in air surveillance and defense.\"",

      "\"These are not isolated incidents or clerical errors,\" Dan Backer, a national campaign finance expert and president of the Coolidge Reagan Foundation, told Fox News Digital. \"This was a sustained pattern of foreign money flowing into a New York City mayoral race which is a clear violation of both federal law and New York City campaign finance rules.

      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest in the legal battle that Kilmar Abrego Garcia faces on 'Special Report.'",
      "Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain in the U.S. through at least the last week of November, according to a new court filing submitted Tuesday morning, as his months-long legal fight with the Trump administration continues to play out in multiple federal courts.",
      "The update comes as Abrego Garcia's dueling criminal and civil cases have emerged as a major flashpoint in the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown. Two separate federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland are currently weighing Abrego's current legal status, and whether the Justice Department acted with \"selective\" and \"vindictive\" prosecution in bringing a criminal case against him earlier this year.",
      "The new schedule ordered by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis allows Abrego Garcia to participate in a two-day evidentiary hearing ordered by another federal judge in Nashville to consider his assertion that his criminal case was motivated in part by the government's desire for retaliation.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw is currently weighing a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers to subpoena the second-highest-ranking Justice Department official, Todd Blanche, for testimony in that hearing. He also ordered the Justice Department to produce various government documents and communications stemming from Abrego's case, including on its decision to open an investigation into the 2022 traffic stop earlier this year.",

      "The proposed schedule was submitted jointly Tuesday morning to Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland who issued an order in August keeping Abrego Garcia in the U.S. for now. She later memorialized the proposed dates in a minute order, including ordering both parties to appear back in her court on Nov. 21 for a motions hearing.",
      "Senior Trump administration officials told her Monday that they planned to deport Abrego Garcia to the third country of Liberia as early as Friday, Oct. 31, regardless of the status of his ongoing criminal case in Tennessee. \"If there were no prohibition, we would remove him on Friday,\" Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign told her. It is unclear what assurances, if any, the Liberian government has provided regarding Abrego Garcia\u2019s status in that country or whether it has agreed not to return him to his home country of El Salvador, in keeping with a 2019 court order.",
      "Justice Department officials reiterated on Monday they have no plans to allow Abrego Garcia to remain in the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee, where he was indicted by a federal grand jury in May on two charges related to immigrant-smuggling. Both charges stemmed from a 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Federal prosecutors acknowledged to Judge Xinis earlier this year that the Justice Department began investigating Abrego Garcia on April 28, 2025 \u2014 at the same time Trump officials were telling her they had \"no power to produce\" Abrego Garcia in the US, in compliance with a court order she issued in March.",

      "The Justice Department declined to comment on what, if anything, prompted it to update their proposed schedule and allow him to remain in the U.S. for the evidentiary hearing.",
      "Instead, the proposed schedule suggests brief deadlines for Nov. 7 and Nov. 14, and asks that Judge Xinis review them by the third week of November, at the earliest.",

      "Separately on Monday, Judge Crenshaw scolded DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to limit their comments on Abrego Garcia's ongoing criminal case in Tennessee, in violation of a local court rule, and ordered prosecutors to notify all employees at the Justice Department and DHS about the rule to prevent any future public remarks.",

      "Crenshaw said Monday that he will review these documents privately before next week's evidentiary hearing kicks off in Nashville, and will later rule on what information the Justice Department must turn over to Abrego Garcia's lawyers before then.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:00:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Revolutionary retinal implant restores central vision in 80% of patients with advanced macular degeneration, offering hope where treatments once only slowed blindness.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",
      "This breakthrough offers new hope for people living with advanced macular degeneration. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Passkeys are a major upgrade over traditional passwords, but we're not living in an all-passkey world just yet. Many sites still rely on passwords, and you'll need backups if something happens to your device. Supplementing passkeys with a password manager is the best move right now; it lets you store, sync and protect both passkeys and passwords under one roof. The good news is that setting up passkeys takes just a few minutes, and once they're enabled, logging in becomes faster and more secure.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",

The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

Here are the top ways to defend yourself against phishing threats and financial fraud.",
      "Adding two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",
      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",

If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",

      "LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION",
      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "The legal fight against deepfake abuse",
      "States across the U.S. are responding to the rise of AI-generated sexual content. More than 45 states have passed or proposed laws to make deepfakes without consent a crime. In New Jersey, creating or sharing deceptive AI media can lead to prison time and fines.",

      "Why legal experts say this case could set a national precedent",
      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",
      "On its official website, the company includes a short disclaimer addressing the ethics of its technology. It states, \"Is it ethical to use AI generators to create images? Using AI to create 'deepnude' style images raises ethical considerations. We encourage users to approach this with an understanding of responsibility and respect for others' privacy, ensuring that the use of undress app is done with full awareness of ethical implications.\"",

      "Parents and educators worry about how quickly this technology spreads through schools. Lawmakers are under pressure to modernize privacy laws. Companies that host or enable these tools must now consider stronger safeguards and faster takedown systems.",
      "What this means for you",

The court's ruling could influence how future AI laws evolve and how victims seek justice.",

      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing.

    "summary": "A cyberattack on SimonMed Imaging exposed personal information of 1.2 million patients, including medical records, financial details and identity papers.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "More than 1 million patients have been affected by a data breach involving SimonMed Imaging, one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and medical imaging providers. The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "NEARLY A MILLION PATIENTS HIT BY DAVITA DIALYSIS RANSOMWARE ATTACK",
      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

      "Spotify is rolling out a major update for parents who want more control over what their children listen to.

      "TEENS FACE NEW PG-13 LIMITS ON INSTAGRAM",
      "A safer way for kids to explore music",
      "Spotify's new managed accounts are built for kids under 13. They offer a music-only experience inside the main Spotify app. Parents can use their Family Plan settings to filter explicit lyrics, block certain artists or songs and hide videos or looping visuals called Canvas. Unlike the limited Spotify Kids app, these accounts exist within the regular Spotify platform. Kids get a familiar interface with features like Discover Weekly and Daylist, but with restrictions that fit their age.",
      "Parents can now guide what their kids listen to while enjoying music together on Spotify. (Spotify)",
      "How managed accounts work",
      "Premium Family subscribers can set up a managed account directly from their Spotify settings. Choose\u00a0\"Add a Member,\" then select \"Add a listener aged under 13.\" Parents control what content plays, while kids build their own playlists and get personalized recommendations based on their listening habits.

      "Managed accounts make family streaming safer, simpler and more personalized for young listeners. (Spotify)",
      "Why this matters for parents",

Managed accounts let parents turn off videos, block podcasts and make sure no age-restricted content slips through. It provides peace of mind for families who love streaming music together.",
      "Kids get their own playlists and recommendations without changing what parents hear. (Spotify)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you already subscribe to the Premium Family plan, this update adds even more value. You still get six individual accounts, and now you can include a customized child account.

      "What is WEEX?",
      "WEEX is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade digital assets, including gold-backed tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT). These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks. While WEEX operates as a legitimate platform, scammers often exploit the name of real exchanges to sound credible. They'll encourage victims to \"trade gold\" through what seems like an official account but actually directs them to fake sites or wallets designed to steal money.",
      "Why this could be a scam",
      "John's experience shows several red flags. The conversation began with a friendly invitation, then quickly shifted to a financial pitch. That's a classic move in online relationship scams. The younger person builds an emotional connection, then uses that trust to promote an \"opportunity.\" Scammers often promise guaranteed profits or claim they'll \"help you trade\" to make the process sound easy.",
      "But the truth is, once you send money or crypto, it's nearly impossible to get it back. Even if WEEX itself is legitimate, the person encouraging you to use it may not be.",

      "How to tell if you're being targeted",
      "You can spot trouble early by asking simple questions. If someone can't explain how the investment works or avoid details about how to withdraw your money, that's a warning sign. Be cautious if they promise fast profits or \"zero-risk\" returns.",
      "Real investments always involve risk. Watch out for anyone who pressures you to act quickly or says the deal is \"private.\" Those urgency tactics are designed to keep you from thinking clearly.",

      "One day, we might see glowing cities of glass scattered across the Moon's surface, shining softly under Earth's light. NASA is teaming up with Skyeports, a California-based company, to explore how lunar dust could be turned into massive glass spheres strong enough to live in. These futuristic, transparent habitats could become the first real homes for astronauts on the Moon.",

      "Skyeports\u2019 vision begins with melting lunar dust in microwave furnaces to create durable glass. (Skyeports)",
      "Turning moon dust into homes",
      "Skyeports has developed a way to transform lunar dust, known as regolith, into durable glass that can be shaped into massive spheres. Using a microwave furnace, the regolith melts and expands like a bubble before cooling into a hard, transparent shell. These spheres could one day serve as living and working spaces for astronauts.",
      "The innovation lies in building directly on the Moon using local materials. No costly shipments from Earth are required. The same pipes used to blow the molten glass will become entrances, while 3D printers inside the spheres will create furniture and fittings using lunar materials.",
      "SPACE STARTUP UNVEILS 1-HOUR ORBITAL DELIVERY SYSTEM",
      "The spherical glass design evenly spreads pressure, forming strong, transparent habitats that can withstand micrometeorites and extreme lunar conditions. (Skyeports)",
      "Self-healing and solar-powered living",
      "The planned glass spheres go far beyond simple shelters. They are designed as self-sustaining ecosystems. The glass can repair small cracks caused by micrometeorites or moonquakes, and built-in solar panels will allow each habitat to generate its own energy.",
      "Inside, temperature layers could create condensation to support plant growth. This would produce oxygen, water and food, making each sphere a self-contained life-support system.",
      "The science behind the glass sphere design",
      "The spherical shape is more than a design choice. It evenly distributes pressure, giving the structure incredible strength. By adding elements like titanium, magnesium and calcium, the glass becomes even tougher and stronger than steel.",
      "Dr. Martin Bermudez, CEO of Skyeports, shared that current prototypes are only a few inches wide, but future spheres could stretch up to 1,640 feet across. His long-term vision is a network of glass cities connected by transparent bridges across the lunar landscape.",

      "NASA\u2019s Innovative Advanced Concepts program supports this research as part of its push to prepare for long-term human life on the Moon under the Artemis mission. (Skyeports)",
      "Future plans to test glass sphere habitats on the moon",
      "This concept is part of NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts program, which funds forward-thinking projects that could transform future missions. With the Artemis program aiming to return humans to the Moon soon, finding safe and sustainable habitats is a top priority.",
      "The Skyeports team plans to test the glassblowing technique in a thermal vacuum chamber, followed by parabolic flight experiments that simulate microgravity. Future trials are scheduled aboard the International Space Station to see how the process performs in real space conditions. If all goes well, tests on the lunar surface could happen within the next few years.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The idea behind these lunar glass spheres reaches far beyond space exploration. It represents a new approach to sustainable design, one that could reshape how we build on Earth. The same techniques could lead to eco-friendly, energy-efficient buildings for our own planet's future. If these glass structures can protect astronauts from extreme lunar conditions, they might inspire a new generation of sustainable architecture here at home.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Malware targeting Android devices has grown increasingly sophisticated. From fake banking apps to phishing campaigns, attackers are finding new ways to trick you into giving up sensitive data.",
      "One of the newest threats comes in the form of malicious apps that appear legitimate but can take full control of your device. Security researchers are now warning Android users to delete a fake VPN and streaming app that can allow criminals to take over your phone and drain your bank account.",

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",
      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store. From there, Klopatra bypasses Android's built-in protections and reaches deep into the system to gain persistence and control.",

      "The Klopatra Trojan gives hackers full control of infected Android devices. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Fake VPNs are a growing problem",
      "VPNs are widely promoted as privacy tools that hide your IP address and encrypt internet traffic. Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed. Criminals exploit both the popularity of VPNs and the prevalence of pirated streaming services to distribute malware effectively. This growing ecosystem of risky apps underscores how important it is to research, verify and only download software from reputable sources.",

      "If you suspect that you've downloaded a fake app from the internet, there's no need to panic. The steps below will help you stay protected and keep your data safe.",
      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",
      "Carefully review what access an app requests. If it asks for control over your device, settings or accessibility services unnecessarily, do not install it. Legitimate VPNs rarely require full device control.",

      "The National Park Service (NPS) announced that three people were convicted of illegal BASE jumping in a national park, and the agency warned would-be outlaws it\u2019s still enforcing the law despite the federal shutdown.",
      "\"We do not tolerate illegal activity in Yosemite National Park,\" Yosemite Superintendent Raymond McPadden said. \"Our law enforcement rangers remain efficient, effective and vigilant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These convictions demonstrate the professionalism and dedication of Yosemite\u2019s protection team in upholding federal regulations and ensuring the safety of both visitors and first responders.\"",
      "Though Yosemite was once a hub for the sport in the 1970s, BASE jumping has been banned in national parks since the 1980s. The activity, an acronym for building, antenna, span and earth, involves jumping from fixed objects with a parachute. It has been linked to numerous injuries, fatalities and risky rescue operations, endangering both jumpers and emergency personnel.",
      "Violators can face fines up to $5,000 or jail time under federal law. Offenders also risk losing their equipment and can be banned from parks. Despite the ban, enthusiasts have continued to jump in secret, often at dawn or dusk to avoid detection.",

      "\"We are aware of reports of BASE jumping in Yosemite and investigate all reports,\" a department spokesperson said. \"BASE jumping is illegal in all national parks, including Yosemite, due to the significant safety risks it poses to participants, the public and first responders.\"",

They are highly trained and, as in any other year at this time, are handling both front country and backcountry patrols as needed.\"",
      "The DOI said Yosemite continues to see normal seasonal visitation levels and that law enforcement rangers are responding to incidents as they normally would. Since the start of the shutdown, there have been three reported and documented BASE jumping complaints, which remain under active investigation.",
      "The department also noted that the use of unmanned aircraft, or drones, is prohibited in Yosemite without a special permit. Violations can result in fines of up to $5,000 or six months in jail.",
      "Officials said drone violations have increased in recent years, driven by the availability of consumer models. In response, Yosemite has expanded signage at entrances and visitor areas to remind the public of these restrictions. During the current shutdown, there have been sporadic reports of unauthorized drone use, and law enforcement rangers are responding as normal.",

Visitor cooperation and volunteer stewardship remain strong, and we appreciate the public\u2019s continued care for these sites.\"",
      "The department added that it is \"proud of the dedicated employees and partners who continue to serve the public during this challenging time\" and said teams are \"working hard to keep parks accessible, safe and welcoming.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic leaders from 25 states are suing the USDA over the looming suspension of SNAP benefits, which is set to begin Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic leaders from 25 states are suing the Agriculture Department over the looming suspension of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Benefits are expected to run dry across the country this weekend because of the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Massachusetts district court, argues that the USDA is legally required to continue providing SNAP benefits during the shutdown as long as it has funding. It calls on the court to compel the USDA to use contingency funds appropriated by Congress to keep the program running.",
      "Up to 42 million people rely on SNAP food assistance, and recipients would ordinarily see their EBT cards get reloaded on Nov. 1. But the USDA website states that the agency will not allocate more funding while the shutdown persists \u2014 an unprecedented situation that could cause widespread hunger across the country.",
      "The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cMillions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cSNAP is one of our nation\u2019s most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running.\u201d",
      "James and her fellow plaintiffs argue that by not allocating contingency funds, the USDA is violating the Food and Nutrition Act, which protects access to SNAP benefits. They also allege that the USDA\u2019s actions are arbitrary and capricious and therefore violate the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "The leaders are seeking a temporary restraining order that would require the USDA to maintain SNAP benefits through November in their states.",
      "When asked for comment about the lawsuit, a USDA spokesperson responded with a statement: \u201cWe are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\u201d",
      "(WIC refers to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, which provides free food to low-income pregnant women, moms and children under 5. The program is similarly in danger of a funding shortfall because of the shutdown.)",
      "If SNAP benefits are suspended, it would be the first time in the program\u2019s 60-year history that the federal government stopped issuing them during a shutdown.",
      "At a news conference about the lawsuit, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, one of the plaintiffs, said he believes the USDA has up to $6 billion in contingency funds \u2014 enough to cover SNAP in November.",
      "\u201cThey are doing this on purpose. It is deliberate. It is intentional. They have the funds. They\u2019re just not using them,\u201d he said.",
      "Bonta added that the USDA acknowledged during the 2019 government shutdown that contingency funds could be used to maintain SNAP benefits.",
      "In a September planning document ahead of the current shutdown, the USDA also said it could use multiyear contingency funds to pay for SNAP benefits and keep state operations running. But that document has been removed from the USDA website, and the department told SNAP directors this month that it did not have enough funding to pay full benefits in November if the shutdown persists.",
      "In a follow-up memo, the USDA said contingency funds were \u201cnot legally available to cover regular benefits.\u201d It said the funds were earmarked for situations like natural disasters and could not be used to supplement regular monthly benefits because Congress has not passed a federal budget. Transferring money from other sources would mean less funding for school meals and infant formula, the department added.",
      "Because October funding for SNAP was allocated prior to the shutdown, benefits have not yet been disrupted. Most states have warned SNAP recipients that they will lose access to benefits at the start of November. Some states are already directing recipients to food banks or suggesting they use any remaining benefits to buy shelf-stable items.",
      "At the news conference Tuesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Republican governors for not joining the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cThe impacts in their states, ironically, are disproportionate,\u201d he said.",
      "The USDA website, however, blames Democrats: \u201cSenate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program,\u201d it says, referring to the standoff over the 2026 federal budget. \u201cBottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\u201d",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now, a person who relies on federal benefits like SNAP, or someone who is feeling the effects of other shuttered services in your everyday life.

    "summary": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene ripped into the shutdown strategy of her fellow Republicans and White House staff during a heated conference call on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., ripped into the shutdown strategy of her fellow Republicans and White House staff during a heated conference call on Tuesday.",
      "Her chief complaint, which she has also aired publicly, is that Republicans are not doing anything to address the looming health care cliff, she confirmed on X after the call. Some funding for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act expires at the end of this year, and many Americans could see their monthly premium costs double or even triple.",
      "The issue has increased urgency because open enrollment begins on Saturday, Nov. 1, and there are concerns that people may drop their coverage for 2026 if they see a spike in prices.",
      "On Tuesday, Greene accused her party of letting the country down, according to a Republican source who was on the conference call. Greene later confirmed the comments herself, even adding more detail, in the latest sign of a rift between her and her party.",
      "Greene has long been one of President Donald Trump's most vocal backers, but in recent weeks, she's bucked her party on a number of high-profile issues, including the administration\u2019s strikes on Iran, the conflict in Gaza and its handling of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.",
      "Not long after Tuesday's call ended, the Georgia Republican began posting on X and confirming reports that she had reamed out her party leadership and expressed frustration with the White House's political team.",
      "\"I said I have no respect for the House not being in session passing our bills and the President\u2019s executive orders. And I demanded to know from Speaker Johnson what the Republican plan for healthcare is,\" she wrote.",
      "Greene also argued that Republicans' shutdown strategy has angered the American people and hurt Trump\u2019s popularity, according to the source on the call.",
      "She advocated for the Senate to get rid of the filibuster and for the House to come back into the session, this person said, although she also simultaneously argued Republicans need to get outside of Washington to listen to the anger of real Americans. The House has not been in session since Sept. 19, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., keeping members out of town to put pressure on Senate Democrats to end the shutdown.",
      "Johnson, who was leading the call, pushed back on Greene. He argued that Republicans are working day and night on a health care solution and that conversations on the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies are ongoing, according to the source on the call.",
      "Greene confirmed as much on X, but said she was unsatisfied with his answer.",
      "\"Johnson said he\u2019s got ideas and pages of policy ideas and committees of jurisdiction are working on it, but he refused to give one policy proposal to our GOP conference on our own conference call. Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan!!!\" she wrote, referring to secure areas for reviewing classified material.",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now, a person who relies on federal benefits like SNAP, or someone who is feeling the effects of other shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Johnson also pushed back on Greene's call for the Senate to nuke the legislative filibuster, according to a second source on the call. Most legislation requires 60 votes to pass the Senate, but Greene and others have suggested doing away with that rule to allow Republicans to reopen the government themselves. Proponents of keeping the filibuster in place worry that nuking it could come back to bite Republicans the next time Democrats take control of the Senate.",
      "Johnson's office declined to comment."

    "story": [
      "As the government shutdown drags on, federal employees who support the country's airports, such as air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers, say they are still in the dark about when they will be paid next.",
      "On Tuesday, workers received their first zero-dollar paycheck, reflecting two weeks of unpaid work amid the ongoing government shutdown. During the nearly monthlong shutdown, these individuals, whose roles are deemed essential, have been required to show up for work without the promise of a paycheck at the end of a standard pay period.",
      "Their last payout was a partial paycheck that included funds for time worked in September before the shutdown began on Oct. 1.",
      "Also Tuesday, controllers took matters into their own hands, pushing back on the work the government is demanding of them by handing out leaflets that describe the impact of the shutdown on aviation workers and how people can contact their members of Congress to call for the shutdown to end. The actions were scheduled to take place at nearly 20 airports nationwide.",
      "\"We are here to ensure that the flying public is safe every time they get on an airplane. We have to be 100% focused, 100% of the time,\" Pete LeFevre, an air traffic controller out of Washington Dulles International Airport, said in an interview with NBC News. \"And all we\u2019re looking for is to be relieved of the financial uncertainty that comes with the government shutdown, and we\u2019d like to be paid as soon as possible.\"",
      "While these federal employees will eventually receive back pay when the government shutdown ends, thanks to a 2018 law, the uncertainty of when that will be has air traffic controllers taking up side gigs to stay afloat.",
      "Some of these workers are now driving for DoorDash or Uber after their grueling work schedules, prompting a few to call in sick due to the job's stress and the extra hours off the clock. The air traffic control industry is understaffed, and current controllers had already been working six-day weeks, 10-hour shifts, before the shutdown.",
      "\"They should never work a side job, that they should never get off a night shift and then go wait tables,\" Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the Tuesday news conference that he has been encouraging controllers to go to work and \"do really important work for our country,\" while acknowledging the unease of working without assured pay.",
      "\"They can\u2019t make it without two paychecks,\" Duffy said of controllers, adding later, \"controllers and those other critical employees need our government to be open and they need to be paid.\"",
      "He acknowledged that there have been \"less problems\" in the airspace this time around compared with prior shutdowns, due to his asking controllers to go to work.",
      "LeFevre added that the lack of pay adds another layer of stress to the already high-stress position.",
      "\"It\u2019s uncomfortable,\" he said. \"We do our best to leave all of our stress and worry at the door, but financial stress is challenging and it\u2019s unique and it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s permeating.\"",
      "The air traffic controller made clear that flying is still safe, and that his colleagues are working to ensure safety in the skies \u2014 something Duffy also called out during the news conference. Duffy has said that if there aren't enough controllers to handle the workload on any given day, flights will be delayed and canceled to mitigate risk.",
      "Within the U.S., 2,109 flights had been delayed as of 1 p.m., according to flight tracking website FlightAware. At least 118 flights had been canceled. It was not immediately clear whether those delays and cancellations were a direct result of controllers calling out of work due to the shutdown.",
      "But the lack of immediate pay is also having a notable impact on real people in their lives outside the office.",
      "LaShanda Palmer, a TSA worker and the president of Local 333, which represents TSA airport employees in Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, said this is the \"most trying\" shutdown she's been through in her 23 years in the industry.",
      "\"We\u2019re all one step away from being out on the street right about now,\" Palmer told NBC News. \"I have officers calling me honestly. They don\u2019t have money for gas, they don\u2019t have money to get child care, they don\u2019t have food. It is extremely hard this go around. It\u2019s hard to get help.\"",
      "She said she's in a similar situation, with a mortgage payment due Saturday that she isn't sure how she'll pay \u2014 her bank account is in the negative, and her bank keeps hitting her with overdraft fees.",
      "\"The oath that I took, nothing has came down on our watch, and I don\u2019t think people even consider that,\" Palmer said. \"We\u2019re doing what we're supposed to do, we should get our check.\""

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Steve Kornacki explores how Andrew Cuomo could close the gap with Zohran Mamdani in the final week of the NYC mayoral race. Plus, Ben Kamisar digs into how Republicans are shifting more of their ad money down ballot in Virginia.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "What Cuomo's narrow path to a NYC comeback would look like",
      "The New York City mayoral election may not be a done deal for Zohran Mamdani.",
      "The Democratic nominee has enjoyed sizable leads in polling and benefitted from an opposition that\u2019s been divided among multiple rival candidates. And he remains the favorite to win next Tuesday.",
      "But there are signs Mamdani has not put the race away yet, chief among them a new Suffolk University poll that shows his lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo slipping to 10 points \u2014 half of what it was when the same pollster surveyed voters last month. That tightening comes after Mayor Eric Adams dropped his own re-election bid a few weeks ago, with much of his support now moving to Cuomo.",
      "Overall, Mamdani leads with 44% support, with Cuomo at 34% and Republican Curtis Sliwa at 11%, according to the new Suffolk poll. That Mamdani\u2019s support level remains under 50% four months after winning the Democratic nomination suggests some real resistance to his candidacy and leaves him vulnerable to any further consolidation of the opposition. Half of Cuomo\u2019s support, the poll finds, is from voters who say they are simply voting against Mamdani.",
      "Sliwa remains adamant that he won\u2019t leave the race, and obviously the more support he retains, the safer Mamdani\u2019s position will be. But there\u2019s risk for Mamdani, a democratic socialist, in the volatility of this final week. The volume of attacks is louder, public scrutiny is heightened, and far more New Yorkers are tuned in to absorb it. Reservations about Mamdani that already exist can be reinforced and new ones can be sown. In this atmosphere, the danger for Mamdani is that voters recognize Cuomo as the only viable alternative and essentially do the consolidating themselves \u2014 that is, they shun Sliwa, hold their noses, and check off Cuomo\u2019s name.",
      "Extrapolating from pre-Election Day voting data can lead to deceptive conclusions, but it\u2019s at least worth noting that the first few days of early voting in New York City have so far yielded an electorate that is older and broader than what was seen in the June Democratic primary. Any chance for Cuomo depends on this becoming a reality. In the Suffolk poll, he leads with voters over 45 years old and gets clobbered among those under 45.",
      "Cuomo himself remains a highly imperfect vehicle for the opposition to Mamdani. He continues to be unpopular, with an upside down 42%/47% favorable rating. If this election is a referendum on him, he will lose, easily. And if he wins, it will be in spite of himself \u2014 and only because just enough voters ended up having even deeper reservations about his opponent.",
      "Virginia Republicans are spending more on the race for attorney general than for governor",
      "In states with high-profile governor\u2019s races, candidates further down the ballot typically rely on the top of the ticket for a boost.",
      "But in Virginia, that dynamic has been flipped on its head in the closing stretch of this year\u2019s campaign, at least on the airwaves.",
      "Republicans have spent more on TV ads in recent weeks on the race for attorney general \u2014 where past violent text messages by the Democratic nominee have roiled the race \u2014 than the higher-profile contest for governor, where the GOP candidate is the underdog.",
      "The bulk of Republicans\u2019 ad spending in these two races in the state, where campaign finance rules allow outside groups to donate directly to candidates, have come from Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the gubernatorial nominee, and Attorney General Jason Miyares.",
      "According to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, Earle-Sears\u2019 campaign spent more than $8.1 million on ads in September, compared to about $5.5 million from the Miyares camp.",
      "But those numbers flipped in October \u2014 $10.2 million from Miyares and $7.5 million from Earle-Sears.",
      "A week-by-week analysis of the ad spending in Virginia underscores how GOP spending has jumped in the attorney general\u2019s race in the final month, as Democratic nominee Jay Jones has faced criticism for suggesting in private text messages three years ago that the then-Republican speaker of the state House get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d",
      "Recent public polling has shown Earle-Sears trailing Spanberger by anywhere from 7 to 12 percentage points, while finding that the two attorney general candidates are locked in a dead heat.",

      "\u201cWe want all international treaties to be respected,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We do not agree with these kinds of attacks, so I have requested that, within the framework of the security agreement we have with the United States, the ambassador be called in and that this situation be reviewed.\"",
      "Based on official estimates from the Defense Department, the U.S. military has launched 13 strikes so far, three of them Monday, which in total have killed 57 people. Eight strikes occurred in the Caribbean Sea, and five took place in the eastern Pacific.",
      "The most recent strike before Monday happened Friday in the Caribbean. Later that day, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said Hegseth directed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford strike group, which had been stationed in the Mediterranean, to relocate to the Caribbean to support President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and counter narcoterrorism.",
      "The attacks are an escalation of Trump's threats to crack down on drug smugglers, even amid bipartisan pushback. Six sources told NBC News this month that members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that the administration isn't being transparent enough about the strikes.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., a Marine Corps veteran, said Sunday in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the strikes amounted to \"murder.\"",
      "\u201cIf this president feels that they\u2019re doing something illegally, then he should be using the Coast Guard,\" Gallego said. \"If there\u2019s an act of war, then you use our military, and then you come and talk to us first. But this is murder.\u201d",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., accused the administration Sunday of violating the Constitution by pursuing military action without congressional approval.",
      "\"I\u2019ve been invited to no briefing, but a briefing is not enough to overcome the Constitution,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it.\"",
      "After another set of strikes last week, Trump said that his administration had the legal authority to carry them out and that the operations could eventually expand to targeting drug traffickers on land.",
      "\u201cWe will hit them very hard when they come in by land,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re totally prepared to do that. And we\u2019ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we\u2019re doing when we come to the land.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported in late September that U.S. military officials were preparing options to target traffickers inside Venezuela. Four sources said at the time that those strikes could take place in a matter of weeks."

      "Her prediction was right. Hours later, the high school senior would go viral for her fast-acting bravery and earn a name within Eilish\u2019s fandom: The \u201cred bandana girl.\u201d",
      "At the concert, Eilish stepped down from the stage and walked through the crowd, greeting fans with smiles and high-fives. Then came a shocking moment: Eilish\u2019s outstretched arm was yanked by concertgoer. He pulled her into the crowd on the other side of the barricade.",
      "The concertgoer has not been identified. The Miami police Department said in a police department that the individual was \u201cejected\u201d from the venue, NBC News reported. There are no criminal charges pending, police said.",

      "Looking back, Saint-Surin reflects on concert etiquette, especially at at time when behavior like concertgoers throwing things at performers is a trend. She hopes the moment encourages people to \u201cenforce more respect (toward) an artist when they\u2019re performing.\u201d",
      "As for what made her the type of person who would intervene when she sees \"disrespect,\" in her words?",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s zero foundation, technique, quality, understanding of the partnership. Bro, I\u2019m getting emotional,\u201d Chmerkovskiy said of Ravnik, who traveled the world with Swift as an \u201cEras Tour\u201d dancer.",
      "Ravnik\u2019s resume includes collaborations with several other pop stars, including Paula Abdul, Bruno Mars and Mariah Carey. Ravnik danced alongside Carey in her 2021 television special \u201cMariah\u2019s Christmas: The Magic Continues,\u201d and also performed on the Billboard Music Awards and Dick Clark\u2019s \u201cNew Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve,\u201d according to his bio on the Joffrey Ballet School\u2019s website.",
      "\u201cIt is absurd, and this is unreal how blind we have to be and God forbid say what\u2019s obviously there,\u201d Chmerkovskiy added.",
      "Chmerkovskiy cited as an example Ravnik and Affleck's foxtrot routine, which earned the couple 32 out of 40 points from the judges.",
      "\u201cHe had no idea what (the) foxtrot is supposed to look like. How are you going to expect him to teach it and deliver that message in a format that is completely different from even ballroom dancing?\u201d asked Chmerkovskiy. \u201cWe had this criticism weeks ago, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Bro, is anybody going to explain it to him?\u2019\u201d",
      "Murgatroyd, 39, said she appreciated the \u201cmoody and dramatic\u201d quality of the couple\u2019s foxtrot and also admired their beautiful \u201cpartner work.\u201d But, the actual \u201cfoxtrot elements\u201d simply \u201cdidn\u2019t hit,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s learning,\u201d Murgatroyd, who danced as a \u201cDWTS\u201d pro for 15 seasons, added of Ravnik. \u201cHe\u2019s learning slowly. It\u2019s his first season. We have to give him grace for not understanding foxtrot technique.\u201d",
      "Murgatroyd agreed with her husband that being partnered with Ravnik has put Affleck at a \u201cmajor disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel bad because she\u2019s not getting taught the basics that she needs to,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s not getting taught the base of the dance.\u201d",
      "Chmerkovskiy, who said he had nothing against Ravnik personally, agreed with Murgatroyd that Ravnik\u2019s lack of ballroom dancing skill is \u201cnot his fault.\u201d",
      "Ravnik\u2019s history with Swift is \u201can obvious reason\u201d he was cast on \u201cDWTS,\u201d noted Murgatroyd.",
      "\u201cApart from that, he\u2019s a lovely guy. He looks great. He obviously is a great dancer, but ...hiring a non-ballroom dancer to teach ballroom dancing to a celebrity as a job is outrageous,\u201d she said.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Ravnik and ABC for comment and did not immediately hear back."

      "Asked if he can name the best thing he\u2019s ever eaten during a TODAY Food segment, Craig visibly flips through his Rolodex of memories, finally shaking his head.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because every month or two, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d he says, his eyes lighting up.",

      "Also in attendance, a slew of super-fans watch TODAY Food segments happen in real life, mingle with the anchors and world-class chefs, and enjoy bites from the demos.",
      "\u201cWe had some Korean fried chicken this morning; she\u2019s here tonight,\u201d Craig says of chef Judy Joo and her recipe. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the most amazing Korean fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Craig adds that earlier in the week, chef Brian Lewis prepared his Herbed Pork Roast during the 3rd Hour, and he thought the same thing: \u201cOh, my God, this is the best pork I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he remembers.",
      "Sheinelle Jones has a similar reaction to another one of Lewis\u2019 dishes that day: the Roasted Beet and Burrata Salad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a beet salad, but it\u2019s not just any beet salad,\u201d she says, waving her hands in the air, emphatically. \u201cIt had fennel and pistachio. It was, like, amazing.\u201d",
      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook. While sampling those foods, attendees are also being served wine, beer and cocktails like Savannah\u2019s Savanita, provided by Diageo, Rockaway Brewing Company and Brooklyn Winery.",

      "Craig says his favorite thing about food segments is the expertise on display.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the quality of food,\u201d he says, especially from culinary stars like Siri Daly, Edy Massih and Priyanka Naik, who are all in attendance.\u2029\u201cThe untold part of the TODAY Food story is the TODAY Food team, and they just do a remarkable job.\u201d",
      "He enjoys most things he eats on the show, but every now and again, he tries a dish that\u2019s not his thing \u2014 and his face makes that clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t hide it,\u201d Craig admits.",
      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",
      "\u201cMy kids don\u2019t like their food to touch, so they\u2019re still in the like, \u2018We like chicken, we like potatoes,\u2019 so sometimes I\u2019ll bring something home, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m called out on a lot on how much food I\u2019m eating,\u201d Dylan says during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by the best-of-the best chefs, you want to taste their food.",
      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

      "Netanyahu's instructions come just weeks after Israel and Hamas agreed to the ceasefire. The deal led to the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and prompted high hopes that fighting would end.",
      "The conflict in Gaza had raged largely uninterrupted since Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas-led attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel and led to nearly 250 being taken hostage. Since then, Israeli forces have killed nearly 70,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, and devastated the enclave, leaving a vast majority of the population with inadequate access to food, shelter and medical care. Famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.",
      "In the weeks after the ceasefire deal, the Israeli military has struck Hamas \u201cto eliminate the threat\u201d posed by militants and \u201cdismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity.\u201d",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has reasserted its control over parts of the enclave that Israel has withdrawn from \u2014 deploying armed police officers, clashing with rival clans, directly firing on and killing Israeli troops and carrying out at least one public execution."

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Burevestnik is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile announced in 2018 by Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",
      "Others see Putin's announcement as a response to sanctions this month by the European Union and Trump.",
      "Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did little to disabuse this idea when asked about it during his daily news briefing Monday.",
      "\"Ensuring security is a vital issue for Russia, especially given the militaristic sentiment we are currently hearing primarily from Europeans,\" he said.",
      "\"Despite all our openness to establishing a dialogue with the United States, Russia, first of all, and the president of Russia, is guided by our own national interests,\" Peskov added.",
      "Some observers, such as Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project, part of Norway's University of Oslo, were not too concerned.",
      "\u201cI celebrate every ruble Russia invests in this useless and unnecessary missile,\u201d he posted to X."

      "Administration officials have told Trump to expect Xi to seek a public declaration from him that the United States \u201copposes\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s as consistent as it\u2019s been for decades,\u201d the official said Monday.",
      "China sees democratic and self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland by military force if necessary. Taipei rejects Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty and seeks to maintain its de facto independence even if it is not formally recognized by most countries.",

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."

      "Two suspects with histories of jewel thefts had been tracked for days after their DNA was recovered from the museum and were arrested Saturday shortly before one of them was set to board a flight out of the country, a police official told NBC News.",
      "The breakthrough came a week after robbers broke into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatening guards and drilling into display cases before escaping on scooters with eight of France\u2019s crown jewels worth an estimated $102 million.",
      "A major police operation has been underway to track down the thieves, who were captured fleeing on camera. But there was still no sign of the jewels themselves.",
      "Police said DNA samples discovered at the crime scene helped identify the suspects.",
      "\"They left gloves, a walkie-talkie, a vest and a can of gasoline,\" Axel Ronde, spokesman for the French police union CFTC, said in an interview Monday.",
      "\"And that allowed my colleagues from the forensic team to find these DNA traces,\" he said.",
      "Ronde added that the two arrested suspects are men in their 30s, who had prior convictions and were known to police as having previously targeted jewelry stores.",
      "They are both from Aubervilliers, a suburb in northeast Paris, Ronde said. He said police decided to move in on Saturday when it became clear that one suspect was planning to flee to Algeria. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport 40 minutes before the flight was due to take off.",
      "While police can hold suspects for up to 48 hours without charge, in organized crime investigations like this one, detention can be extended to 96 hours.",
      "\"I think there is going to be more arrests quickly,\" said Robert Wittman, a former FBI art crime investigator.",
      "He added that the arrest of the first suspects would allow police to gather more evidence through searches of their homes and cellphone data.",
      "While investigators worry that the thieves may melt down or dismantle the jewels to sell them off as soon as possible, there remains hope that the stolen artifacts can be recovered intact.",
      "Wittman said the thieves may have good reason to preserve the jewels rather than destroy them right away.",
      "\"In places like France, and Europe, they can use those to get out of jail free,\" he said, adding that destroying the jewels would leave the thieves with no \"bargaining tools\" if they were arrested.",
      "Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators continued to search for the stolen jewels and the remaining suspects but that it was \"too early\" to provide the public with any more detail.",
      "\"I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody,\u201d she said, adding that she did not want to hinder the investigation.",

      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",

Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",

      "Trump also signed a trade agreement with Malaysia, which U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said would be \u201cmodifying its tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\u201d Malaysia is also subject to a 19% U.S. tariff rate.",
      "In addition, Trump signed deals with Malaysia and Thailand on critical minerals, which are key components of electronic devices and defense technologies.",
      "Finding alternative sources of critical minerals has become a matter of urgency for the U.S. after China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, announced export controls as part of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.",
      "Speaking at the signing of the U.S.-Malaysia trade deal, Greer said it was important to secure supply chains for critical minerals \u201cfor our people and security of our economies.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is the first stop on Trump\u2019s Asia trip, which will also take him to Japan and South Korea.",
      "While in Malaysia, Trump is also attending the annual summit for ASEAN, a regional group with 11 members after East Timor was formally admitted on Sunday.",
      "During his first term as president, Trump attended the ASEAN summit only once, raising questions about his administration\u2019s commitment to a strategically important region being courted by both the U.S. and China.",
      "Attending this year\u2019s summit \u201csends the enduring message that the U.S. is back and is ready to provide strong countermeasures and deterrence against China in economic and security capacities,\u201d said Collins Chong Yew Keat, a foreign affairs, security and strategy analyst at Universiti Malaya in Kuala Lumpur."

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan tries to placate President Donald Trump amid contentious trade talks, officials may be eyeing an icon of American manufacturing that has virtually no presence there: The Ford F-150 pickup truck.",
      "Trump, who is visiting the key U.S. ally next week as part of his first trip to Asia since returning to office, has long criticized the lack of American vehicles sold in Japan, citing what he believes are non-tariff barriers.",
      "Japanese auto brands such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Subaru are ubiquitous in the United States, where Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Cars are Japan\u2019s top export to the U.S., though according to JAMA most Japanese cars sold there are actually assembled in North America.",
      "By contrast, Japanese brands account for more than 90% of new cars sold in Japan, which imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",
      "In August, Trump suggested that there would soon be a market in Japan for American cars, specifically the Ford F-150.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re taking the very beautiful Ford 150, which does very well and I\u2019m sure will do very well there,\u201d he told CNBC. The model has long been the best-selling vehicle in America, according to industry outlets.",
      "Reuters reported this week that Ford F-150s were part of a purchase package being finalized to present to Trump during talks in Tokyo next week, citing two sources with knowledge of the preparations. It said the trucks might be used in Japan as snow plows.",
      "Local media in Japan have also said the government is considering buying the trucks.",
      "Japanese officials have not confirmed the reports, and the new trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, was not asked about them at his first news conference on Friday.",

      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",
      "Many of the vehicles sold in Japan are mini or \u201ckei\u201d cars that are far smaller and more fuel efficient than the ones produced by American automakers. They are required by law to be no more than about 11.2 feet long and 4.9 feet wide, compared with the F-150 which is typically more than 17 feet long and 6.6 feet wide.",

      "\u201cUnlike European car companies, Ford and General Motors (GM) don\u2019t have dedicated port facilities or dealerships,\u201d Smitka said in emailed comments. \u201cThey\u2019d be very expensive to import, expensive to market, and because there\u2019s no network, expensive to service.\u201d",
      "Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In 2016, the company said that it would close all operations in Japan, saying it had struggled to gain market share and saw \u201cno reasonable path to profitability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t try to sell pickups because they understand the market,\u201d Smitka said.",

    "summary": "Russia reacted with outrage after President Donald sanctioned Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil.",
    "story": [
      "Russia reacted with outrage Thursday after the United States imposed substantial sanctions on its two largest oil companies, the first economic punishments slapped on Moscow by President Donald Trump during his second term.",
      "Experts said it remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this move may damage the Russian economy or Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine, as Trump hopes to pressure Moscow to halt its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Days after canceling a planned summit with Putin, citing a lack of progress in the negotiations, Trump took the major step by effectively blacklisting Rosneft and Lukoil.",
      "The announcement was welcomed by Kyiv and its European allies, which added their own new raft of sanctions on Moscow, earning the ire of Russian officials and the state-controlled media.",
      "Speaking to journalists at the Kremlin on Thursday, Putin called the sanctions an \"unfriendly act\" but quickly brushed off their likely impact. \"They are serious in nature and will have certain consequences, but they will not have a significant impact on the health of our economy,\" he said.",
      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

      "Top U.S. officials have hit out at the Israeli parliament's move toward annexing the already occupied West Bank, labeling it an \u201cinsult\u201d that could damage Washington's efforts to keep the Gaza ceasefire on track and build toward a more lasting peace deal.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that if the vote in the Knesset was a \u201cpolitical stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally took some insult to it.\u201d Speaking with reporters, Vance called the vote \u201cweird\u201d and said, \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t happy about it.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio separately warned Wednesday night as he prepared to depart for Israel that the Knesset's actions could imperil President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict. Rubio was set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Thursday.",
      "A bill seeking to apply Israeli law to the West Bank, a move seen as amounting to annexation of the land that Palestinians view as part of a future state, gained preliminary approval from Israel\u2019s parliament earlier Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a vote in the Knesset, but obviously I think the president\u2019s made clear that\u2019s not something we\u2019d be supportive of right now,\u201d Rubio told reporters late Wednesday on the tarmac.",
      "Vance, meanwhile, maintained that \"the West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel,\" adding that that was the \"policy of the Trump administration\" and that it would \"continue to be our policy.\"",
      "In a statement after their comments, Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the vote was a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\" during Vance's visit to Israel.",
      "It said Netanyahu's Likud party did not vote for the bills, except for one \"disgruntled\" member who it said was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee. \"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it said.",
      "Trump said weeks ago that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. The vote was the first of four needed to pass the law, according to Reuters.",
      "Time magazine reported that Trump said in an interview over the phone last week that Israel \u201cwould lose all of its support\u201d from the United States if it annexed the West Bank.",
      "\"It won\u2019t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries,\" he said. \"It will not happen. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.\"",
      "Rubio was the latest U.S. official to make his way to Israel in recent days, on the heels of Vance, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "On Wednesday, Vance sought to emphasize that U.S. officials were not flocking to Israel to babysit the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after a flare-up in violence raised fears the truce could collapse. He stressed that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions around the next steps in Trump\u2019s peace plan grew.",
      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire. The two sides also clashed over delays in returning hostage bodies held by Hamas and ongoing barriers to aid access in the enclave.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast War, and it has defended the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, but much of the international community views them as illegal.",
      "A rise in settler violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have been viewed as directly imperiling the Palestinian cause and as major impediments to resolving the decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex part of the world,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday. \u201cI think every day is going to bring opportunities and it\u2019s also going to bring some challenges, OK? We\u2019re dealing with decades and decades of this stuff.\u201d",
      "Despite warning of the impact the Knesset\u2019s moves toward annexation could have on peace efforts, Rubio still projected optimism over the future of the current ceasefire deal.",
