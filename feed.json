      "The 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist Brigitte Bardot has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In addition to being a 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist, Brigitte Bardot was a muse to many \u2014 in particular, musicians.",
      "Her name, with its alliterative cadence, became synonymous with a kind of classic beauty. In songs, Bardot is often not Bardot the woman, but a symbol for desire \u2014 shorthand for a bombshell. Decades removed from the peak of her screen fame, contemporary performers continue to sing her name despite her many controversies, including being convicted five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred and provocative comments about the #MeToo movement.",
      "It may not be her main legacy, but Bardot, who died Sunday in southern France, will live in on the songs that mention her. Across genre and language, here is a sampling.",
      "The last track of the canonical \u201cThe Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan\u201d exhibits Dylan's wicked verbosity and elastic folk. \u201cWell, my telephone rang it would not stop / It\u2019s President Kennedy callin\u2019 me up / He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow? I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnita Ekberg / Sophia Loren / Country\u2019ll grow.\u201d",
      "The Brazilian artist Caetano Veloso composed the protest song at the beginning of the tropicalismo movement; it became a hallmark of his career and one of the best-known Brazilian songs of all time. In it, he sings, \u201cEm caras de presidentes / Em grandes beijos de amor / Em dentes, pernas, bandeiras / Bomba e Brigitte Bardot\u201d (\u201cIn faces of presidents / In big kisses of love / In teeth, legs, flags / Bombs and Brigitte Bardot\u201d).",
      "A central architect of French pop, singer Serge Gainsbourg wrote this duet for himself and Bardot. It's styled after a poem the outlaw Bonnie Parker wrote, titled \u201cThe Trail\u2019s End,\u201d shortly before she and partner Clyde Barrow were killed.",
      "Jaunty piano and Elton John's ascendent vocal melodies, all for a song with a less-than-optimistic title. John sings the words from his longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin: \u201cI\u2019d make an exception / If you want to save my life / Brigitte Bardot gotta come / And see me every night.\u201d",
      "The Pretenders know a little something about the social power of Bardot. The English rock band's principal songwriter and frontperson Chrissie Hynde sings: \u201cWhen love walks in the room / Everybody stand up / Oh, it\u2019s good, good, good / Like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d",

      "Maybe it's a bit unfair to include Billy Joel's classic here, which name-drops more than most pop hits, but it's telling that Bardot gets a shoutout alongside \u201cBudapest, Alabama, Khrushchev / Princess Grace, Peyton Place, trouble in the Suez,\u201d and just after \u201cEinstein, James Dean, Brooklyn\u2019s got a winning team / Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland.\u201d Not an obscure name in sight.",
      "\u201cStratford-On-Guy,\u201d from influential indie rocker Liz Phair's seminal album \u201cExile in Guyville,\u201d takes aim at the dude-centric music scene. But it also uses Bardot to describe a flight attendant who reminds her that while communities can be insular, they all look the same from 30,000 feet. \u201cThe stewardess came back and checked on my drink / In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot,\u201d she sings. \u201c\u2019Cause I had on my headphones along with those eyes / That you get when your circumstance is movie-sized.\u201d",
      "In the second verse of \u201cWarlocks,\u201d from the funky California rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers, singer Anthony Kiedis near-scats, \u201cRing side and blow-by-blow / Another main event at the old Rainbow / We\u2019re comin\u2019 right on top of the tupelo / When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d It's a descriptive image of Los Angeles \u2014 even with the inclusion of Bardot.",
      "Kali Uchis and Jorja Smith's dreamy collaboration imagines \u201cBardot\u201d as shorthand for a make-out session with a complicated partner. \u201cThe world\u2019s been asking us to lose control,\u201d Uchis swoons. \u201cAll we ever do is French like Brigitte Bardot (Brigitte Bardot).\u201d",
      "Olivia Rodrigo is best known for her spirited punk-pop, but she's also a power balladeer, lest anyone forget it was \u201cdrivers license\u201d that made her a household name. \u201cLacy,\u201d a cut from \u201cGuts,\u201d is soft and slow, with Rodrigo obsessing over a woman she is not. It's a jealous song, and ripe for a Bardot mention. \u201cSmart, sexy Lacy, I\u2019m losin\u2019 it lately / I feel your compliments lik\u0435 bullets on skin,\u201d she whisper-sings. \u201cDazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnat\u0435 / Well, aren\u2019t you the greatest thing to ever exist?\u201d",
      "It arrives right at the top to describe an addictive crush. \u201cShe was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot,\u201d the pop powerhouse Chappell Roan sings over springy synths and cheery guitar riffs. \u201cShe showed me things I didn\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91",
      "PARIS -- Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant media attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broken into her house two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.",
      "Nicolas\u2019 father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor who she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\u201cI was looking for roots then,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI had none to offer.\u201d",
      "In her 1996 autobiography \u201cInitiales B.B.,\u201d she likened her pregnancy to \u201ca tumor growing inside me,\u201d and described Charrier as \u201ctemperamental and abusive.\u201d",
      "Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, and they divorced three years later.",
      "Among her films were \u201cA Parisian\u201d (1957); \u201cIn Case of Misfortune,\u201d in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960); \u201cPrivate Life\u201d (1962); \u201cA Ravishing Idiot\u201d (1964); \u201cShalako\u201d (1968); \u201cWomen\u201d (1969); \u201cThe Bear And The Doll\u201d (1970); \u201cRum Boulevard\u201d (1971); and \u201cDon Juan\u201d (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",
      "\u201cIt was never a great passion of mine,\u201d she said of filmmaking. \u201cAnd it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.\u201d",
      "Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St. Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after \u201cThe Woman Grabber.\u201d As fans brought flowers to her home Sunday, the local St. Tropez administration called for \"respect for the privacy of her family and the serenity of the places where she lived.\"",
      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewelry to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.",
      "Depression sometimes dogged her, and she said that she attempted suicide again on her 49th birthday.",
      "Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking why the U.S. Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.",
      "She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",
      "In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.",
      "Environmental campaigner Paul Watson, who was beaten on a seal hunt protest in Canada alongside Bardot in 1977 and campaigned with her for five decades, acknowledged that \u201cmany disagreed with Brigitte\u2019s politics or some of her views.\u201d",

      "Hollywood has wrapped up a turbulent 2025 with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cMarty Supreme.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood wrapped up a turbulent year with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a box-office hit for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet with \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d over a busy holiday weekend in movie theaters.",
      "As expected, James Cameron\u2019s latest trip to Pandora dominated ticket sales, collecting $88 million over the four-day Christmas-to-Sunday period and $64 million on the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though \u201cFire and Ash\u201d initially opened notably softer domestically than its 2022 predecessor, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d it held better in its second weekend. It dipped just 28%, whereas \u201cWay of Water\u201d fell 53%.",
      "In two weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has quickly amassed $217.7 million in North America for The Walt Disney Company. But the $400 million-budgeted film has been a massive draw internationally, grossing $542.7 million thus far overseas. To reach the box-office heights of the previous films, both of which rank among the biggest blockbusters ever, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will need to sustain business through New Year\u2019s and early January. If it does, \u201cAvatar\u201d could become the first franchise with three $2 billion movies.",
      "But much of the heat in theaters over Christmas and on the weekend belonged to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d A24\u2019s biggest budget release, Josh Safdie\u2019s 1950s-set table tennis drama collected $27.1 million over the four-day weekend, a smash success for the indie studio.",
      "Chalamet went to great lengths to promote the acclaimed release, including appearing atop the Sphere in Las Vegas. The strong opening proved that the 30-year-old star has drawing power beyond most of his contemporaries, and it marked a rare box-office win for a wholly original film. Safdie\u2019s film carries a price tag of about $70 million.",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d even bested the film most analysts expected to rank number two: Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cAnaconda.\u201d The big-screen comedy, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, collected $23.7 million over the four-day holiday weekend. That\u2019s still good for comedy, a genre most studios have abandoned in recent years. But \u201cAnaconda\u201d (50% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) was surely dinged by poor reviews.",
      "Hollywood is ending the year with its best Christmas Day box office since before the COVID-19 pandemic, a celebratory final note in what\u2019s been a rough year for the film industry. Going into the year, expectations were high for the industry\u2019s first year this decade not marred by pandemic or strike.",
      "\u201cIt was a really solid end to a tumultuous year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt's been a roller-coaster ride. I think the best news for the industry \u2014 I know we kind of say this every year \u2014 but if you look at the lineup for 2026, it's pretty incredible.\u201d",
      "But domestic ticket sales on the year are ending roughly on par with the disappointing $8.75 billion in 2024. With three days left in 2025, the box-office total is $8.76 billion, according to Comscore. By comparison, in 2019, that total was $11.4 billion.",
      "That\u2019s a worrying development for theaters, which are now nervously watching Netflix attempt to buy one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios in Warner Bros. The highest grossing film of the year was a Chinese production, the $2 billion-generating \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d The most-watched movie of 2025 was \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d a movie Sony Pictures sold to Netflix. Even the Oscars are headed to YouTube.",
      "What worked in 2025? PG-rated movies. For the second year in a row, PG-rated movies outperformed PG-13 ones. Domestically, PG films generated $2.87 billion, according to Comscore, while PG-13 movies collected $2.78 billion.",
      "The three biggest Hollywood blockbusters were all PG-rated: \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($1.42 billion globally), \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion) and \"A Minecraft Movie\u201d ($958.2 million).",
      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d even outranked the newcomers over the traditional weekend. In its fifth weekend, it earned another $20 million. Propelled by \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney became the first studio since 2019 to cross $6 billion worldwide in the year.",
      "Yet expectations are already growing for a rebound year at the box office in 2026. Among the major titles upcoming are \u201cThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Brand New Day,\u201d the live-action \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cToy Story 5\u201d and \u201cThe Mandalorian and Grogu.\u201d",
      "The coming week, when schools are out and many people are off work, should be one of the busiest weeks of the year in theaters. Aside from the top films, a number of other releases will hope to capitalize.",
      "That includes Lionsgate's \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the Paul Feig thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried ($46.7 million in two weeks); \u201cDavid,\u201d the animated David and Goliath film from Angel Studios ($49.8 million in two weeks); Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants\u201d ($38.2 million in two weeks); and Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",

      "Fernando D\u00e1vila, a 72-year-old artist in Florida, paints vibrant works despite being colorblind",
      "DORAL, Fla. -- When Fernando D\u00e1vila was 8 years old in Colombia, he failed a drawing class because he painted donkeys red.",
      "There was a reason for that: He is colorblind.",
      "Now the 72-year-old D\u00e1vila is an established and respected artist whose vibrant paintings have been exhibited in South America, Europe and the United States.",
      "\u201cI have the most wonderful job in the world, which is painting every morning,\u201d D\u00e1vila said from his studio in a Miami suburb. \u201cTo mix colors. To have joy to share with the world, that's really my passion.\u201d",
      "He started off painting only in black and white until he was around 30 years old because of his colorblindness, a congenital condition which makes it difficult for people to tell the difference between certain colors, particularly red and green, and shades of color. There is no cure for the condition, which for D\u00e1vila also makes the colors pink, violet, turquoise and yellow-green confusing.",
      "Since the mid-1980s, D\u00e1vila has painted in color through the help of glasses developed by an ophthalmologist in New York, where D\u00e1vila was living at the time. One lens is transparent and the other is shaded red, and they help him discriminate between contrasting shades that normally blur together. With the lenses, he can see almost two-thirds of the colors, but without them he only sees around 40% of the colors.",
      "D\u00e1vila compared his condition to having a box of chocolates but only being able to eat a sample of the selection. He says he has such a strong desire to see every color.",
      "\u201cIt's something that I miss in my life, that if somebody says, \u2018Look at this flower,\u2019 which is bright, bright pink, I want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's something that comes from my heart so passionately. I can feel the vibration of color.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for the man accused of killing iconic rapper Tupac Shakur are pushing to suppress evidence that was collected in what they say was an unlawful nighttime search",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an \u201cunlawful nighttime search.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a \u201cmisleading portrait\u201d of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there\u2019s a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning.",
      "In reality, Davis, an ex- gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed.",
      "\u201cThe court wasn\u2019t told any of this,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the motion. \u201cAs a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality \u2014 a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.\u201d",
      "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, \u201cpurported marijuana\u201d and tubs of photographs \u2014 declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents.",

      "His attorneys claim Davis\u2019 arrest stems from false public statements Davis had made in which he claimed to be present in the white Cadillac from which Shakur was shot. They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present. He dodged drug charges by telling the story in a proffer agreement, and he has made money by repeating it in documentaries and his 2019 book, according to his attorneys.",

      "Christian music is growing in popularity while other genres struggle to grow new listenership",
      "NEW YORK -- It is one of the most surprising music stories of the year. While streams of new music \u2014 releases from the last 18 months \u2014 were down from last year, one genre is on the rise: Christian and gospel music, according to industry data and analytics company Luminate\u2019s 2025 Midyear Report.",
      "Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, said the shift is led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship, who are connecting with a \u201cyounger, streaming-forward fan base\u201d that's 60% female and 30% millennial. In fact, for the first time in 11 years, two contemporary Christian music songs \u2014 Frank\u2019s \u201cYour Way\u2019s Better\u201d and Lake\u2019s \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah\u201d with Jelly Roll \u2014 broke through the Billboard Hot 100's all-genre Top 40, placing them in direct competition with mainstream artists.",
      "It's also why traditionally secular artists like Jelly Roll, Killer Mike and T.I. are nominated in Christian music categories at the forthcoming 2026 Grammys \u2014 the lines are blurring.",
      "\u201cChristian music (is) unlike any other genre that\u2019s defined by a sonic component. Christian music is defined by its lyrical component,\u201d says Holly Zabka, the president of Provident Entertainment, a Sony Christian music subsidiary. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a narrow definition. It\u2019s a lyrical component that can appeal to anyone\u2019s musical preference.\u201d",
      "From a label perspective, she\u2019s interested in pursuing artists that \u201cdon\u2019t have to fit within that narrow lane of Christian bookstore and Christian radio. It can be rap, hip-hop, it can be rock, it can be country, and that\u2019s appealing to a broader audience because it\u2019s what they\u2019re already listening to,\u201d she says. \u201cVery few people listen in a vacuum and only listen to one genre.\u201d",
      "But for many years, CCM jas held a reputation for being unimaginative \u2014 what writer John Jeremiah Sullivan infamously referred to as \u201cexcellence-proof\u201d \u2014 for its tendency to mimic and water down popular, contemporary mainstream sounds for a religious audience.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s been an improvement in quality,\u201d says Zabka. \u201cWhen all the music has to live side by side on these streaming platforms, we can\u2019t just be the cheap alternative. \u2018Oh, you like Taylor Swift? You will like this lesser version offering in the Christian genre.\u2019 We want to be the greatest art.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to imitate before you innovate,\u201d Chris Brown, singer and worship leader at Elevation Worship, jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as many rigid lines stylistically within Christian music as maybe there was 10 years ago or certainly like 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a period of time where people idealized Christian music as like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have this look, we\u2019re going to sound like this,\u2019\u201d says two-time Grammy-winning Christian and pop musician Lauren Daigle. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more artistry now. People are very expressive. They\u2019re able to share their creativity. And that also comes with different types of people represented.\u201d",
      "Zabka says her genre is experiencing \u201ca special moment and \u2026 a perfect storm.\u201d Streaming and the ability to connect on social media have democratized music discovery, she says, allowing CCM to compete with secular music.

The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, says that he called off the performance in the wake of the White House announcing last week that President Donald Trump's name would be added to the facility.",
      "As of last Friday, the building's facade reads The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision, which scholars have said violates the law. Trump had been suggesting for months he was open to changing the center's name.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\u201d Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \u201cJazz Jams\u201d at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \u201cKeter\u201d Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump's name from the building once he leaves office and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.",

      "Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs are asking a federal appeals court in New York to order his immediate release from prison",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a federal appeals court in New York late Tuesday to order his immediate release from prison and reverse his conviction on prostitution-related charges or direct his trial judge to lighten his four-year sentence.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime.",
      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",
      "They noted that Combs was convicted of two lesser counts, prostitution offenses that didn\u2019t require force, fraud, or coercion. They asked the appeals court, which has not yet heard oral arguments, to acquit Combs, order his immediate release from prison or direct Subramanian to reduce his sentence.",
      "\u201cDefendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses \u2014 even when coercion, which the jury didn\u2019t find here, is involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cThe judge defied the jury\u2019s verdict and found Combs \u2018coerced,\u2019 \u2018exploited,\u2019 and \u2018forced\u2019 his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy. These judicial findings trumped the verdict and led to the highest sentence ever imposed for any remotely similar defendant,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "At the trial, former girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified that Combs ordered her to have \u201cdisgusting\u201d sex with strangers hundreds of times during their decade-long relationship that ended in 2018.

      "He added: \u201cYou abused the power and control that you had over the lives of women you professed to love dearly. You abused them physically, emotionally, and psychologically. And you used that abuse to get your way, especially when it came to freak-offs and hotel nights.\u201d",

      "Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be resentful you\u2019re not part of any of them, not even the one where Tom Waits plays Adam Driver\u2019s dad. To be fair, all the groupings are pretty cool on paper. In the first chapter, siblings Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Mayim Bialik) drive together to visit their father (Waits) for the first time in a while. In the second, a mother (Charlotte Rampling) awaits her grown daughters Tim ( Cate Blanchett ) and Lilith ( Vicky Krieps ) for their annual tea. And in the third, all that\u2019s left of Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy\u2019s (Luka Sabbat) parents are things.",
      "But these are awkward and strained hangouts, none connected to one another literally, and all in different parts of the world. Yet there are little threads throughout \u2014 Rolex watches, toasting with water, red clothing, and the idiom \u201cbob\u2019s your uncle,\u201d for instance. And then there\u2019s the more cosmically haunting realization that familiarity and closeness are not always in the cards when it comes to family. In \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d everyone would rather be anywhere but where they are. Same same, but different, you know?",
      "The film opens with \u201cFather,\u201d and siblings Jeff and Emily reluctantly doing a kind of wellness check on theirs. They\u2019re both very buttoned up and formal, both in appearance (blazers, sweaters, combed hair) and demeanor. Waits, as their father, is very much the opposite \u2014 one might imagine that he doesn\u2019t even own a blazer, or a comb for that matter. His home is as rumpled as his zip up hoodie sweatshirt and he is a little bumbling himself, rattling off all the drugs he\u2019s not taking (anymore). The chasm between him and his children is vast and growing. Besides the death of their mother, it doesn\u2019t even seem like there was even some inciting incident that might explain some level of estrangement \u2014 they\u2019re just very, very different. And the father might not be as helpless and destitute as he\u2019s presenting to his children. After they leave, he tidies the place up and calls a friend to go out to a nice dinner.",
      "Blame it on the age of the people who get to make the movies, but the parents are often the afterthoughts, the supporting characters in the children\u2019s stories. Jarmusch slyly inverts this in the \u201cFather\u201d segment, which perfectly tees up expectations for his next entry, \u201cMother,\u201d in which Rampling is on the phone, presumably with a therapist, mentally preparing for her daughters to arrive. They all live around Dublin, but rarely see one another, making this tea a bit of a dreaded ritual. Blanchett\u2019s Tim, a quintessential first born, is very stressed about being late. Krieps\u2019 Lilith, meanwhile, is all about posturing \u2014 bragging about material things and accomplishments that she doesn\u2019t have the receipts for and knows on some level no one believes anyway. These women aren't connecting either.",
      "In the final segment, the parents are gone. They\u2019ve died and left behind only mementos in a Parisian apartment that\u2019s three months overdue on rent. This is both a puzzle and a mess that their children now have to clean up and make sense of. \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d is in some ways deeply cynical about family bonds and the possibility of ever really knowing ones' parents. It\u2019s devoid of warm, fuzzy sentiment and trite revelations, just the crushing idea that no matter what bloodlines might exist, we\u2019re all fundamentally strangers.",

      "\u201cCome on, fall,\u201d urges You Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) as he grills an eel for dinner for his family in the opening moments of Park's film. He's eager for the season to start but unprepared for the amount of cyclical collapse \u2014 familial, economic, even existential \u2014 that Park has in store.",
      "Man-su pronounces the very thing no movie protagonist ever should: \u201cI've got it all.\u201d He lives with his wife, Miri (Son Ye-jin), and two children (Kim Woo Seung, Choi So Yul) in a handsome modernist house in the woods, with two golden retrievers. But almost as soon as he says that, Man-su's fortunes turn. After 25 years at a paper mill, Man-su is laid off, as are many others, with little fanfare or apology. Desperation begins to set in. He's forced to sell the home he loves so dearly, including the attached greenhouse where he tends to plants and bonsai trees. They even have to, horror of horrors, cancel Netflix.",
      "Another movie might have sunk with Man-su into bankruptcy and midlife struggle, following his quest to find a new line of work and restart his life. This is not that movie. Man-su, considering his prospects, decides he needs to better his odds of new employment. After posting a fake job listing and comparing all the incoming resumes, he decides he's about the fifth best option for any new paper mill managerial jobs. He decides to kill the ones with better credentials.",
      "The concept, a Grade-A barnburner of a movie idea, is not new. \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d South Korea's Oscar submission, is based on Donald Westlake\u2019s 1997 crime novel \u201cThe Ax,\u201d which Costa-Gavras also made into a film in 2005. But Park, the filmmaker of such diabolical movies as \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d and \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d is exquisitely suited to the material. This is a director capable of conjuring menacing brutality with nothing but a hallway and hammer.",
      "And in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d he remains at the peak of his powers, archly and elegantly spinning a yarn about a murderous rampage that accumulates wider and wider reverberations. \u201cHitchcockian\u201d is a term that often, understandably, finds Park. He is, like Hitch, a seemingly polite and erudite man with a latently dark imagination. But for more than two decades, Park has cut his own bloody, unyieldingly meticulous path in movies that are rarely predictable, very funny and sneakily revelatory.",

He is probably the preeminent filmmaker of putting wild, outrageous happenings into cleverly formal, eminently stylish imagery. As Man-su bumbles from target to target, each potential murder is a window into another family reckoning with unemployment. The way Man-su spies on them (or worse) adds delicious layers of satire. Relish, especially, the way Park uses reflections and trees.",
      "How \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d puts capitalism in the crosshairs, with a handsome house in the center, will no doubt bring to mind another Korean satire: Bong Joon Ho's \u201cParasite.\u201d Park had been wanting to make his film for almost two decades. Either way, the two movies would make one hell of a destabilizing double feature.",
      "If \u201cParasite\u201d was the feat of an ensemble, \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d belongs to Lee. His Man-su is no killer at heart, and his attempts to become one are as comical as they are Dostoyevskian. The tone is so farcical that the gruesomeness of some of Man-su's acts come slyly. How many movies have we seen about a parent driven, heroically, to extremes to defend their family? Man-su's circumstance is frightfully understandable. \u201cOur family is in a war,\u201d he says. To keep them happy \u2014 in particular Miri \u2014 Man-su thinks whatever it takes is necessary.",
      "But what makes \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d brilliant is how it shows that perceived predicament as a ubiquitous mistake of modern life. I won't spoil the incredible final minutes of Park's film, but they expand the notion of necessary termination \u2014 of a job, of a life \u2014 to automation, AI and beyond. The leaves falling in \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d aren't coming back in the spring.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet squints as he gazes out at the Manhattan shoreline. It\u2019s a few hours before the premiere of his new movie, \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d but at this moment, he\u2019s sitting on a quiet bench at the end of a West Side pier.",
      "It\u2019s brisk and there\u2019s snow on the ground, but it\u2019s sunny and Chalamet, dressed warmly in a parka, is enjoying the perspective looking back at the city. For him, it\u2019s like looking back on himself.",
      "\u201cNow in my late 20s, there should be every reason to go, \u2018All right, career\u2019s good. Let me start shilling out,\u2019\u201d says Chalamet, who turns 30 just after Christmas. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I\u2019ve quadrupled down on the original pursuit of my life. I\u2019ve gotten out of the pool and redived from a higher board.\u201d",
      "That high dive is \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s hyperkinetic 1950s-set New York tale of a singular striver. Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a Jewish kid working at a shoe store who aspires to be the best table tennis pro in the world. The character is loosely based on a real-life player, Marty Reisman, but the movie is just as much a reflection of Chalamet and Safdie\u2019s own whatever-it-takes ambitions.",
      "\u201cThe gift of my life is this work,\u201d Chalamet says while seagulls fly overhead. \u201cYou want to honor it. Not in some Keynesian way \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right economist to cite. Capitalistic is not what I mean. I mean: If you\u2019re not going up, you\u2019re kind of going down. \u2018He not busy being born is busy dying,\u2019 the great Dylan quote. Ooh, is that on the money.\u201d",
      "Since his breakthrough performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d Chalamet has been on an ever-ascending path that seemed to reach a culmination when he, soon after finishing shooting on \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d declared that he\u2019s \u201cin pursuit of greatness\u201d while accepting the best actor award from the Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "But \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is yet another new level for Chalamet. His Marty, far from a period-piece study, is a blur of forward motion. (To shoot the film\u2019s sprinting poster, Safdie closed down two blocks, so Chalamet would be up to full speed.) To make his dreams a reality, Marty uses every desperate scheme and every bit of grandiose swagger. He's a quintessentially American hustler, and it\u2019s probably the defining performance of Chalamet\u2019s young career. A year after he came so close, it may win him his first Academy Award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a long arc thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m chasing a feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d which opens wide Thursday, is a big test. A24 spent some $70 million on it, making it one of the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted movies ever. To build the hype, Chalamet has unveiled some very Marty-esque stunts, including an 18-minute video of a pseudo-Zoom call about the movie\u2019s marketing. That led to a real orange blimp, emblazoned with \u201cDream Big,\u201d flying over Los Angeles.",
      "When The Associated Press caught up with Safdie at his Chelsea office, he had recently returned from promoting the movie in London, Brazil and Los Angeles. For him, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d could hardly be more personal. Pingpong paddles filled his office, as did an old piece of awning scrounged from Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s New York comedy club. Safdie once tried to turn pro at table tennis, himself, before moviemaking became his obsession.",
      "\u201cMy dad is the ultimate dreamer,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cHe still dreams to this day. When I was a kid, I\u2019d ask him where I came from. And he\u2019d say, \u2018You came from the stars.\u2019 It put this intense feeling inside me that there was huge future ahead of me.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother, Benny, set out to make films, they had a New York hustler mentality. For their second feature, \u201cDaddy Longlegs,\u201d they approached the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, then working as a projectionist, and told him he had to star in the film. Bronstein wasn't even an actor.",
      "\u201cI thought: This guy is made out helium and I\u2019ve had my feet stuck in lead for six years,\u201d recalls Bronstein, who co-wrote \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "The hardscrabble life of independent filmmaking made Safdie accustomed to giving everything to get his movies made. To convince a potential financier to pay for the basketball portions of 2019's \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Safdie, a non-drinker, remembers downing half a dozen whiskies during a meeting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re at their beck and call,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother finished \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d years of pouring everything into Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler\u2019s character in the film) left him feeling purposeless. \u201cYou start to ask yourself: What is the purpose of a dream?\u201d",

      "Safdie and Chalamet first met back in 2017, at the premiere of \u201cGood Time,\u201d just months before the release of \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the guy. Some agent told me he was the next big superstar. And you hear that a lot from agents,\u201d says Safdie. \u201cBut you got the sense that he saw it. And he had a vision for it. He had this energy to him. He was Timmy Supreme.\u201d",
      "Safdie sent Chalamet a video of table tennis players from 1948 set to Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cI Have the Touch.\u201d The suggestion was: This is a period movie told with contemporary topspin. For years, while working on other movie sets, Chalamet built up his table tennis skills.",
      "\u201cJosh wanted me to tap into a period of my life when my audacity was all I had,\u201d Chalamet says. Immediately, he saw himself in Marty. \u201cI was singularly driven starting at 14.\u201d",
      "Safdie and Chalamet are now launching something almost anathema in theaters this holiday season: a wholly original, big-budget, R-rated movie fronted by star power. Signs suggest audiences aren\u2019t just ready, they\u2019re hungry for it. The limited opening of \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d in six cinemas, set per-screen records. There were 92 sellouts.",
      "\u201cI said this when I went to (former high school) LaGuardia last year: Don\u2019t act for other actors. Act for real audiences,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cWhile we were shooting \u2018Dune 3\u2019 over the summer, Denis (Villeneuve) said at some point he realized it was more about pleasing real people. You look at the business structure of the film industry, how it\u2019s been contracting since the \u201980s, it\u2019s ludicrous to be focused on anything but real audiences.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see more original movies made,\u201d adds Chalamet. \u201cThey\u2019re the most exciting ones to see. Every original film I\u2019ve seen this year, I like it before I even start it. That\u2019s a whole new mentality I\u2019ve had, just feeling like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is also a part of the proud lineage of New York movies, and self-consciously crafted in an American movie tradition. It may feel like a millennial watershed, but its production design is by a legend of an earlier era, Jack Fisk. The 74-year-old Bronx filmmaker Abel Ferrara appears in it. They're veterans of a grittier, more handcrafted time stretching back to the 1970s that's been particularly influential to Safdie. Robert Altman\u2019s 1902-set 1971 film \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d he notes, is the exact same time difference between when it takes place and when it was shot as \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe tradition, particularly of New York filmmaking, movies like \u2018French Connection,\u2019 I try to let them seep into me,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m casting Abel Ferrara. I\u2019m trying to at least cultivate those influences.\u201d",
      "That \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a deeply New York film, and maybe a new classic one, is also a special point of pride for Chalamet, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Leaning forward as the afternoon winter light brightens the waterfront, Chalamet remembers he used to play soccer as a kid on this pier.",
      "\u201cJust to be here, back where I\u2019m from. What a dream,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cI also feel like my artistry has grown, not as a talking point or as hyperbole, but as a humble fact of foundation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the kind of thing Marty might say. Indeed, some of Chalamet\u2019s recent declarations have struck some like he\u2019s still in character. Asked whether he\u2019s sincere or engaging in a little Method marketing, Chalamet takes a long pause and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d",

Same goes for low-fat yogurts \u201cmade with real fruit,\u201d \u201corganic\u201d plant-based milks and bottled \u201csuperfood\u201d smoothies.",
      "Buyer beware: Healthy grocery buzzwords like those often cover up an unhealthy amount of sugar.",
      "Added sugars are difficult to quickly spot because many companies use clever marketing to distract consumers, said Nicole Avena, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical School and Princeton University who has studied added sugars.",
      "Avena said while some health-forward brands know people are starting to become aware of the hazards of added sugars, \"a lot of the bigger brands don\u2019t worry so much about people\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s how to spot hidden sugars and what to do about it.",
      "Along with saturated fat and salt, eating excess sugar is linked to heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other health risks.",
      "The average American consumes 17 grams of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, according to the American Heart Association. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.",
      "To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.",
      "Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren\u2019t considered \u201cadded sugars\u201d under FDA regulations.",
      "\u201cNow our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,\u201d Avena said.",
      "Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what\u2019s in a typical can of soda.",
      "But that might be too flexible, Popp said.",

      "The key is to be mindful of what you\u2019re eating, even if the product seems healthy or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars. So can English muffins and Greek yogurt.",
      "One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.",
      "Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.",
      "Although they lower the calorie content of foods, artificial sweeteners like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said. She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.",
      "That\u2019s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn\u2019t affect blood sugar.",
      "But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",

      "A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died",
      "WASHINGTON -- Medicaid programs made more than $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died, according to a new report from the independent watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "But the department's Office of Inspector General said it expects a new provision in Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill requiring states to audit their Medicaid beneficiary lists may help reduce these improper payments in the future.",
      "These kinds of improper payments are \u201cnot unique to one state, and the issue continues to be persistent,\u201d Aner Sanchez, deputy regional inspector general in the Office of Audit Services told The Associated Press. Sanchez has been researching this issue for a decade.",
      "The watchdog report released Tuesday said more than $207.5 million in managed care payments were made on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 to July 2022. The office recommends that the federal government share more information with state governments to recover the incorrect payments \u2014 including a Social Security database known as the Full Death Master File, which contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "Sharing the Full Death Master File data has been tightly restricted due to privacy laws which protect against identity theft and fraud.",
      "The massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer expands how the Full Death Master File can be used by mandating Medicaid agencies to quarterly audit their provider and beneficiary lists against the file, beginning in 2027. The intent is to stop payments to dead people and improve accuracy.",

Since 2016, HHS' inspector general has conducted 18 audits on a selection of state programs and had identified that Medicaid agencies had improperly made managed care payments on behalf of deceased enrollees totaling approximately $289 million.",
      "The government had some success using the Full Death Master File to prevent improper payments earlier this year. In January, the Treasury Department reported that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave Treasury temporary access to the file for three years as part of the 2021 appropriations bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the SSA has been making unusual updates to the file itself, adding and removing records, and complicating its use. For instance, the Trump administration in April moved to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers to crack down on immigrants who had been temporarily allowed to live in the U.S. under programs started during the Biden administration.",

      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "Two gunmen are accused of shooting 15 people dead and wounding another 40 in an attack on a Hannukah festival on Bondi Beach on Dec. 14.",
      "In an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, 17 families of the dead and wounded called for a federal inquiry known as a royal commission to investigate a rise in antisemitism in Australia since the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023 and consequent security agency failures.",
      "Royal commissions are the most powerful form of public investigation in Australia and witnesses can be jailed for deliberately withholding evidence.",
      "\u201cWe need to know why clear warning signs were ignored, how antisemitic hatred and Islamic extremism were allowed to dangerously grow unchecked, and what changes must be made to protect all Australians going forward,\u201d the letter said.",
      "But Albanese continued to resist calls from the families, Jewish leaders and opposition lawmakers to establish such a royal commission, saying it would take years to provide answers.",
      "Instead, he announced the terms of an inquiry by retired bureaucrat Dennis Richardson that would examine potential failings in procedures and laws that led to the shooting, which was allegedly inspired by the Islamic State group. That inquiry will report in April next year.",
      "\u201cMy heart breaks for the families of the victims of the Bondi terrorist atrocity,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cAnd my heart goes out to them at what is an incredibly traumatic time.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy job, as the Australian prime minister, is to act in the national interests. It is in the national interest for us to do the Richardson review on national security,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said federal authorities would support a royal commission promised by the New South Wales state government, which is based in Sydney.",
      "The families\u2019 letter says a state inquiry is not enough.",
      "\u201cThe rise of antisemitism in Australia goes far beyond one state jurisdiction. It is a national crisis that demands a powerful response,\u201d the families said.",
      "As the nation reels from its worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996, the usual New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations have been canceled at Bondi. Tickets sold to an annual music festival at Bondi will be refunded, organizers said.",
      "Security will be tightened at Sydney\u2019s main celebration with heavily armed police expected to be visible. More than 1 million revelers are expected to crowd the waterfront to see a fireworks display centered on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said he was discussing with the federal government getting the army involved in bolstering security in Sydney.",
      "The New South Wales Police Operation Shelter was established within weeks of the Hamas attack on Israel to reduce antisemitic and antisocial behavior and other hate crime activity in Sydney. The operation has been provided with additional resources following the Bondi attack.",

      "More than 43,000 people around the world have donated more than 2.5 million Australian dollars ($1.7 million) to a fundraising campaign set up to thank him for his intervention.",
      "Al Ahmed, who was released from a Sydney hospital last week after multiple surgeries, told U.S.-based CBS News his soul had asked him to save lives.",

      "The clashes came two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers. Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere.",
      "Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven't publicly identified a suspect in Friday's bombing. Funerals for the dead were held Saturday.",
      "A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday commuted to Cheong Wa Dae, the country\u2019s traditional presidential palace, for the first time since taking office in June, more than three years after his ousted predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol moved the presidential office to the Defense Ministry compound.",
      "It was the first time a president had commuted to Cheong Wa Dae since May 9, 2022, the final day of former President Moon Jae-in\u2019s term, before Yoon began his presidency working out of a converted Defense Ministry building. Following the relocation, Yoon opened parts of Cheong Wa Dae to the public as a tourist site, which drew millions of visitors.",
      "Lee, who won a snap presidential election in June following Yoon\u2019s removal over a brief declaration of martial law in December 2024, spent weeks relocating the presidential office back to Cheong Wa Dae, also known as the Blue House, as he seeks to erase the legacy of his now-jailed predecessor.",
      "Cheong Wa Dae is nestled on the lower slopes of a mountain in northern Seoul, occupying about 250,000 square meters (62 acres) behind the historic Gyeongbokgung Palace. The site, which has undergone several renovations over the decades, has served primarily as the country\u2019s presidential office since the government\u2019s founding following independence from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II.",
      "Ahead of Lee\u2019s commute, officials raised a presidential flag featuring two phoenixes at Cheong Wa Dae at midnight, marking the palace\u2019s return as the official presidential office. Guards saluted as Lee\u2019s motorcade passed the compound gates, as dozens of supporters nearby waved the South Korean flag and chanted his name.",
      "Lee\u2019s office later released a video of him holding a tea meeting with senior aides in one of Cheong Wa Dae\u2019s rooms.",
      "He later inspected Cheong Wa Dae\u2019s National Crisis Management Center, an underground bunker for security and disaster response coordination that was refurbished ahead of his return, and carried out his first approval at the palace by formally accepting Benin\u2019s ambassador-designate to South Korea, presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said.",

      "Martial law lasted only hours, after a quorum of lawmakers broke through a military blockade and voted to lift the measure. Yoon was impeached later that month, removed from office in April by a Constitutional Court ruling and re-arrested in July. He now faces serious criminal charges, including rebellion, which carries a possible life sentence or the death penalty.",

      "Sunday\u2019s launches were the latest weapons display by North Korea ahead of its planned ruling Workers\u2019 Party congress early next year. Keen outside attention on the congress, the first of its kind in five years, will be on whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will establish new priorities in relations with the U.S. and respond to Washington's calls to resume long-dormant talks.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim expressed \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d over Sunday's launches, which occurred off the country\u2019s west coast.

      "Touad\u00e9ra is one of Russia\u2019s closest allies in Africa and analysts say a third term win for him would likely consolidate Russia\u2019s security and economic interests in the country even as Moscow faces growing scrutiny over its mercenaries\u2019 roles in Africa.",
      "The Central African Republic was among the first in Africa to welcome Russia-backed forces, with Moscow seeking to help protect authorities and fight armed groups. Tensions, though, have grown this year over Moscow\u2019s demand to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with the Russian military unit Africa Corps.",
      "Some 2.4 million voters were registered to vote in Sunday\u2019s national elections, which was unprecedented in scope as it combines the presidential, legislative, regional and municipal ballots.",
      "The voting process was generally smooth after initial delays at some polling stations. Voting ended around 7 p.m. local time followed by the counting of ballots. Electoral officials had yet to share any assessment of voter turnout.",
      "Provisional results are expected in a week\u2019s time. A runoff will be held if no presidential candidate gets more than 50% of the votes cast.",
      "Touad\u00e9ra faced challenges from six candidates, including prominent opposition figures Anicet-Georges Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 and Henri-Marie Dondra, both former prime ministers. The election is being held without the main opposition coalition, the Republican Bloc for the Defense of the Constitution, which said in October that it will boycott the election after denouncing what it called an unequal political environment. Neither Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 nor Dondra are part of it.",
      "Analysts say Touad\u00e9ra is a clear favorite after consolidating his control of state institutions in recent years, and due to the absence of strong opposition.",
      "Backed by Russia, he has hinged his campaign on efforts to achieve peace, stability and economic recovery in the country of about 5.5 million people, long battered by conflict.",
      "The landlocked country has been plagued by fighting between pro-government forces and armed groups, particularly since 2013 when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced then President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 from office. A 2019 peace deal only partially lessened the fighting, and some of the 14 armed groups that signed it later withdrew from the agreement and continued their fighting.",

      "The U.K. prime minister is facing criticism after celebrating the return of human rights activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah from Egypt",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. prime minister is facing criticism after he celebrated the return to Britain of a human rights activist who was recently released from an Egyptian prison but whose past social media posts apparently contained violent and antisemitic language.",
      "Successive British governments have campaigned for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a dual national who had been imprisoned in Egypt for most of the past 14 years. He returned to the U.K. on Friday after Egyptian authorities lifted a travel ban that had forced him to remain in the country since he was freed in September.",
      "But a senior member of the opposition Conservative Party on Saturday criticized Prime Minister Keir Starmer for giving a \u201cpersonal, public endorsement\u201d to Abd el-Fattah when Starmer said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d the activist had been reunited with his family in Britain.",
      "Robert Jenrick, the Conservative spokesman on justice issues, demanded to know whether Starmer knew about historical social media posts in which Abd el-Fattah allegedly endorsed killing \u201cZionists\u2019\u2019 and police. Jenrick also called on Starmer to condemn Abd el-Fattah\u2019s statements and withdraw his \u201cunalloyed endorsement\u201d of the activist.",
      "\u201cNobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily nor for peaceful dissent,\u2019\u2019 Jenrick wrote. \u201cBut neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed.\"",
      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement that it had been \u201ca long-standing priority\u201d of governments under both major parties to work for Abd el-Fattah\u2019s release. But that does not imply an endorsement of his social media posts, the spokesman said.",
      "\u201cThe government condemns Mr. El-Fattah\u2019s historic tweets and considers them to be abhorrent,\u201d the statement said, using a slightly different style for his last name.",
      "Abd el-Fattah\u2019s family in the U.K. had vigorously campaigned for his release, arguing that he had spent most of the past 14 years behind bars because of his opposition to the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.",

      "But soon after Abd el-Fattah arrived at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, critics began circulating historical social media posts in which he appeared to endorse the killing of Zionists and police.",
      "The Times of London reported that Abd el-Fattah has previously said the comments were taken out of context and were part of a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d that took place during an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Abd el-Fattah\u2019s press team didn\u2019t immediately response to a request for comment, and it was not immediately clear whether the posts were authentic.",

      "TAMBACOUNDA, Senegal -- On a blazing afternoon in Senegal, 33-year-old farmer Filly Mangassa heaved peanut plants onto a horse-drawn cart, sending clouds of dust swirling.",
      "Ten years ago, he left his village for the capital, Dakar, dreaming of becoming a professor. But the high cost of living and lack of jobs put that dream out of reach.",
      "\u201cParticularly after COVID, companies weren't hiring and prices were rising,\u201d said Mangassa, who has a masters degree in criminology. \u201cI thought: My father and my grandfather were farmers, so why not use that experience and go back to my hometown and try to make a living in agriculture.\u201d",
      "Across much of Africa, farming has long been seen as low-status work, pushing young people to cities in search of office jobs.",
      "\u201cFor my father and some people in my family, they sort of saw me returning to the countryside as a step back,\u201d Mangassa said.",
      "But that perception is changing. Rising food prices, investments in irrigation and access to new technologies are making agriculture more profitable. Governments and nonprofits now fund programs that teach advanced farming skills and support farmers with equipment, fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.",
      "\u201cWhen my father saw that I had a clear, thorough business plan, he encouraged me and helped me with the administrative process to acquire land,\u201d Mangassa said.",
      "He is part of a trend of young Africans leaving cities to try their luck at farming. Mangassa says he makes a profit of around 2 million CFA ($3,500 a year), far above Senegal's average yearly income of about $2,500.",
      "Africa is the world\u2019s fastest-urbanizing region, with cities growing at an average rate of 3.5% per year. As city populations increase, so does the cost of living.",
      "Median rents and grocery prices in places like Dakar or Kenya\u2019s capital of Nairobi are approaching those of major European cities, despite median salaries being significantly lower, according to the World Bank.",
      "Meanwhile, between 10 and 12 million young Africans enter the job market each year while only about 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the African Development Bank.",
      "\u201cA lot of my friends who graduated at the same time as me now work as motorcycle taxi drivers and barely make a living,\u201d Mangassa said.",
      "Mangassa now owns a 32-acre farm where he grows peanuts, corn, vegetables and fruit. He received some funding to buy land from a World Food Program initiative helping young Africans start careers in agriculture.",
      "Launched in 2023 and set to run through early 2027, it has supported around 380,000 people in launching agricultural businesses.",
      "It works with local governments to allow young farmers to acquire land \u2014 often a challenge because of complex ownership systems and young people's difficulty in obtaining loans because they are seen as high risk.",

      "Political parties in Thailand have registered their candidates to become prime minister after the upcoming general election, marking the unofficial start of campaigning",
      "BANGKOK -- Political parties in Thailand on Sunday registered their candidates for the next prime minister, marking the unofficial start of campaigning for the Feb. 8 general election.",
      "Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved Parliament earlier this month to call early polls, after the main opposition party prepared to seek a no-confidence vote over constitutional change. Calling a new election allows Anutin and his Bhumjaithai Party to build up their numbers in the House of Representatives to gain a more secure grip on government.",
      "Voters will simultaneously cast ballots in a referendum asking whether they want a new constitution, a move promoted by progressive parties who claim the current powers held by the bureaucracy and unelected bodies are undemocratic.",
      "The election is seen as primarily pitting Anutin\u2019s conservative party against the progressive People\u2019s Party, which under a different name and leadership won the highest number of House seats in the 2023 election. It ended up being blocked by conservative lawmakers from gathering enough support to form a government.",
      "The populist Pheu Thai Party, backed by billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is another major contender. It took power after the 2023 election, when the People\u2019s Party\u2019s effort was stymied. Thaksin remains the dominant figure behind Pheu Thai even though he is serving a prison term for convictions related to corruption and abuse of power.",
      "Anutin has held office for only three months after the court-ordered removal of his predecessor, Thaksin\u2019s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, for what were judged ethical lapses.",
      "Anutin\u2019s government saw a slip in popularity following deadly flooding in southern Thailand and high-profile scandals that ensnared several officials and business figures. However, he may have boosted his appeal by adopting an aggressive military posture appealing to nationalists as Thailand engaged in large-scale combat with Cambodia over a long-standing border dispute.",
      "The Election Commission says 68 people from 32 parties registered as prime minister candidates, while 1,502 people from 52 parties are running as \u201cparty list\u201d nominees, who gain seats according to each party\u2019s proportional share of the vote.

      "Anutin won the September vote to become prime minister with support from the People\u2019s Party in exchange for a promise to dissolve Parliament within four months and organize a referendum on the drafting of a new constitution by an elected constituent assembly. However, the People\u2019s Party at the same time insisted on acting as an opposition party.",

      "South Korea is chasing a coal-free future in efforts to slash carbon emissions, an ambitious goal for the fossil fuel-dependent country",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.",
      "At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
      "Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world\u2019s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.",
      "But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country\u2019s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.",
      "Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.",
      "South Korea\u2019s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.",
      "Still, it's unclear how South Korea will \u201cmanage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.",

      "South Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists\u2019 expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.",
      "\u201cThis range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,\u201d said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping \u2018America First\u2019 tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.",
      "As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.",
      "The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.",
      "LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea\u2019s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.",
      "South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.",

    "story": [
      "The month after Christmas has been dubbed \u201cReturnuary\u201d for good reason",
      "The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning.",
      "The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year.",
      "A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens.",
      "\u201cClothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,\u201d said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management.",
      "Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it.",
      "If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel.",
      "If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again.",
      "And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%.",
      "Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling.",
      "If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility.",
      "\u201cIt can be quite expensive,\u201d said Sarkis. \u201cAnd if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you\u2019ll get. You\u2019ll get another return and you\u2019ll lose a customer who\u2019s unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.\u201d",
      "Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff \u2014 think a bathing suit or a bra \u2014 is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that.",
      "And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental \u2014 and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free.",
      "\u201cRefurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,\u201d said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said Cardiff University logistics and operations management lecturer Danni Zhang.",
      "If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season.",

      "Another tip: in-person shopping is better than online because purchases get returned less often, and in-person returns are better, too \u2014 because those items get resold more often. Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances.",
      "\u201cIf I can return in-store, then I definitely will,\" Zhang said. \u201cThe managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Obviously the best thing consumers can do is minimize returns. Many shoppers engage in \u201cbracketing behavior,\u201d or buying multiple sizes of the same item, keeping what fits, and returning the rest.",
      "\u201cThis behavior of bringing the dressing room to our homes is not sustainable,\u201d said Faires.",
      "If you're buying for someone else, you can also consider taking the guesswork out of the equation and going for a gift card.",
      "\u201cI know we do really want to pick up something really nice to express our love for our friends or our family. But if we are more sustainable, probably the gift card will be much better than just purchasing the product,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Sarkis wants to see companies provide more information in product descriptions about the environmental impact of returning an item, or how much of the purchase price factors in return costs.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they want to send a negative message,\" he said. \u201cIf you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.\u201d",
      "Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already Amazon is requiring customers pay in certain situations.",
      "On the tech side, Blue Yonder\u2019s recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them.",
      "\u201cHaving that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,\u201d said van Gendt. \u201cSo that\u2019s a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.\u201d",
      "Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.",

      "Final results won't be known until after two more rounds of voting are completed later in January. It's widely expected that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has governed Myanmar since an army takeover in 2021, will then assume the presidency.",
      "The military government has presented the vote as a return to democracy, but its bid for legitimacy is marred by the absence of formerly popular opposition parties and reports that soldiers used threats to force voters\u2019 participation.",
      "While more than 4,800 candidates from 57 parties are competing for seats in national and regional legislatures, only six are competing nationwide with the possibility to gain political clout in parliament. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is by far the strongest contender.",

      "Final results are expected to be announced by February. It wasn't clear if or when the authorities would release aggregate figures of Sunday's voting, although counts were publicly announced at local polling stations.",
      "Critics of the current system say that the election is designed to add a facade of legitimacy to the status quo. Military rule began when soldiers ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It blocked her National League for Democracy party from serving a second term despite winning a landslide victory in the 2020 election.",

      "Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels over similar charges in the region. In November, Iran seized a ship as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over what it said were violations, including carrying an illegal consignment.",
      "The West has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",

    "story": [
      "In a breathless year of tariffs unleashed by the administration of President Donald Trump, perhaps no one has had to live the reality of every fluctuation of trade policy than customs brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- After a half-century immersed in the world of trade, customs broker Amy Magnus thought she\u2019d seen it all, navigating mountains of regulations and all sorts of logistical hurdles to import everything from lumber and bananas to circus animals and Egyptian mummies.",
      "Then came 2025.",
      "Tariffs were imposed in ways she\u2019d never seen. New rules left her wondering what they really meant. Federal workers, always a reliable backstop, grew more elusive.",
      "\u201c2025 has changed the trade system,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect before, but it was a functioning system. Now, it is a lot more chaotic and troubling.\u201d",
      "Once hidden cogs in the international trade machine, customs brokers are getting a rare spotlight as President Donald Trump reinvents America\u2019s commercial ties with the world. If this breathless year of tariffs amounts to a trade war, customs brokers are its front lines.",
      "Few Americans have been exposed as exhaustively to every fluctuation of trade policy as the customs broker. They were there in the opening days of Trump\u2019s second term, when tariffs were announced on Canada and Mexico, and two days later, when those same levies were paused. They were there through every rule on imports of steel and seafood, on cars and copper, on polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, and on and on. For every tariff, for every carve-out, for every order, brokers have been left to translate policy into reality, line by line and code by code, in a year when it seemed every passing week brought change.",
      "\u201cWe were used to decades of a certain way of processing, and from January to now, that universe has been turned kind of upside-down on us,\u201d says Al Raffa, a customs broker in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who helps shepherd containerloads of cargo into the U.S. packed to the brim with everything from rounds of brie to boxes of chocolate.",
      "Each arrival of products imported to the country requires filings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and often, other agencies. Importers often turn to brokers to handle the regulatory legwork and, with a spate of new trade rules unleashed by the Trump administration, they\u2019ve seen their demand grow alongside their workloads.",
      "Many shipments that entered duty free now are tariffed. Other imports that had minimal levies that might cost a company a few hundred dollars have had their bills balloon to thousands. For Raffa and his crew, the ever-expanding list of tariffs means a given product could be subjected to taxes under multiple separate tariff lines.",
      "\u201cThat one line item of cheese that previously was just one tariff, now it could be two, three, in some cases five tariff numbers,\u201d says 53-year-old Raffa, who has had jobs in trade since he was a teenager and who has a button emblazoned with \u201cMake Trade Boring Again.\u201d",
      "Government regulations have always been a reality for brokers, and the very reason for their existence. When thick tomes of trade rules changed in the past, though, they typically were issued long ahead of their effective dates, with periods for comment and review, each word of policy crafted in an attempt to project clarity and definition.",
      "With Trump, word of a major change in trade rules might come in a Truth Social post or an oversized chart clutched by the president in a Rose Garden appearance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d be remiss not to be looking at the White House website on a daily basis, multiple times a day, just to see what executive order is going to be announced,\u201d Raffa says.",
      "Each announcement sends brokerage firms into a scramble to attempt to dissect the rules, update their systems to reflect them and alert their customers who may have shipments en route and for whom any shift in tariffs could mean a major hit to their bottom line.",
      "JD Gonzalez, a third-generation customs broker in Laredo, Texas, and president of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, says the volume and speed of changes have been challenging enough. But the wording of White House orders has often left more unanswered questions than brokers are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cThe order is kind of vague sometimes, the guidance that\u2019s being provided is sometimes murky, and we\u2019re trying to make the determination,\u201d 62-year-old Gonzalez says.",

      "\u201cIt was maybe taken for granted how that wonderful piece of gourmet cheese got on the shelf, or that Gucci bag,\u201d says Raffa. \u201cUp until this year, people were clueless what I did.\u201d",
      "Magnus, who is in her 70s and based on Marco Island, Florida, spent 18 years at U.S. Customs before starting at a brokerage in 1992. She came to find comfort in the precision of rules governing every import she cleared the way for, from crude oil to diamonds.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t like to have any doubt, we don\u2019t like to leave anything up to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ourselves are struggling, trying to interpret and understand the meaning of some of these things, it is a very unsettling place to be.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the White House orders that have complicated her work.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting blitz under billionaire Elon Musk led to layoffs and retirements of trusted government workers that brokers turn to for guidance. A shutdown slowed operations at ports. And fear of being out of step with the administration has some federal employees cautious about decoding trade orders, making answers on interpretation of tariff rules sometimes tough to come by.",
      "Magnus was befuddled by moves that seemed at odds with everything she knew of trade policy. Canada as adversary? Switzerland subjected to 39% tariffs? It defied how she had come to see the choreography of cargo and what it says about the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an incredible ballet to be able to trade with all these countries all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my own mind, I always felt that as long as we were trading and we were friendly with each other, we were reducing the chance of war and killing each other.\u201d",
      "Work has been so hectic this year that Magnus hasn\u2019t managed to take a vacation. Weekends have so frequently been upended by Friday afternoon edicts announcing a tariff is going into effect or being taken away that it has become an inside joke with colleagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cIs everybody watching?\u201d",
      "A couple hours after Magnus repeats this, the next White House order is posted, undoing a slew of tariffs on agricultural products and sending brokers into another scurry.",

      "Consumers increased their spending, particularly on items like gadgets and clothing, for the first seven weeks of the holiday shopping period",
      "NEW YORK -- Consumers stepped up their spending, particularly on items like gadgets and clothing, for the first seven weeks of the holiday shopping period. But the pace was slower than a year ago amid worries about higher prices and other economic concerns, according to new data from Visa released Tuesday.",
      "From Nov. 1 through Sunday, holiday sales rose 4.2%, a slower clip from the 4.8% increase during the same period a year ago, according to the company's Visa Consulting & Analytics division, which analyzed a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S.",
      "The figure includes all methods of payment including cash and card.",
      "The data, which exclude sales from auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants, are not adjusted for inflation including the impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "When adjusted, retail sales rose a more modest 2.2% for that time frame, according to Visa's principal U.S. economist Michael Brown. That compares to the inflation-adjusted 3% sales gain last year.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",
      "Retailers have described shoppers as being selective when making holiday purchases, choosing to focus on gifts for under the tree instead of holiday decor like ornaments for the tree, for example. Many households are struggling with higher prices in groceries, rent and imported goods hit by tariffs. The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",
      "As a result, consumers' mood has been gloomy, though it improved last month as worries about inflation eased a bit, according to the University of Michigan.",
      "When all the numbers are in, Visa expects holiday sales data will more or less be in line with its prediction of a 4.6% sales increase for the November and December period combined.",
      "Still to come are several of the holiday shopping season's top 10 busiest days including Tuesday, the day after Christmas and the Saturday after Christmas, according to Sensormatic, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "The Visa data is in line with the forecast from the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail industry trade group. It expects sales over November and December of between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion. That would be up 3.7% to 4.2% over last year.",

A big drag on October data was a drop in sales at motor vehicles and auto parts dealerships, hurt by the expiration of federal government subsidies that sliced demand for battery-powered electric cars.",
      "According to Visa, e-commerce sales rose 7.8% for the first seven weeks of the period, fueled by promotions that started early in the season.",
      "Still, shopping at physical stores dominates \u2014 73% of holiday payment volume was in physical stores, while 27% of retail spending happened online, Visa said.",
      "Sales at general merchandise stores, or big discounters like Target and Walmart that sell all types of merchandise, rose 3.7%, Visa said.",
      "Electronics have emerged as the hottest category, with sales rising 5.8% during this time frame, fueled in part by devices, powered by artificial intelligence, Visa said.",
      "Tariffs played a key role in how shoppers bought, Brown said.",
      "Clothing and accessories sales accelerated at a 5.3% pace from Nov. 1 through Dec. 21 from a 4.1% increase last year. The category wasn't as affected by tariffs as other areas like holiday home decor, which is predominantly made in China, Brown said. That category saw a slim 0.8% sales gain.",
      "And a still weak housing market hurt sales of home improvement items like building materials and garden accessories, which recorded a 1% sales increase, Visa said.",

Most airlines operate with fewer than 200 employees per aircraft, a common benchmark of productivity.",

      "The Panthers' defense appeared ready to get off the field on Seattle's next possession, but two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jaycee Horn was flagged for grabbing Smith-Njigba's facemask on a third-down reception on third-and-21, more than 15 yards behind the first-down marker.",
      "That gave Seattle a first down, and the Seahawks cashed in with Jason Myers' 30-yard field goal to make it a two-possession game with eight minutes remaining.",

      "\u201cCredit to them,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey made adjustments to the game plan and did a better job of executing it. We are going to go up against different schemes and teams that are going to make adjustments. We need to be able to react to that and counter it.

      "\u201cI have full confidence we\u2019ll go home and win next week,\" said Aaron Rodgers, who was 21 of 39 passing for 168 yards.",
      "It is the first time since Dec. 10, 2009, that the Browns (4-12) defeated the Steelers and held them without a touchdown. It is also the seventh time in Rodgers' 256 starts that his offense hasn't reached the end zone. Only one of those resulted in a win.",
      "\u201cOutstanding, and a bunch of individual efforts. Obviously, Myles getting all the attention he got. I thought (cornerback) Tyson (Campbell) was outstanding,\" coach Kevin Stefanski said. \u201cI thought (linebacker) Carson (Schwesinger) battled and fought like he always does and ends up tackling the guy to the ground. You know, just a bunch of individual efforts and just that was what was required today.\u201d",
      "The Steelers came into the game without top wide receiver DK Metcalf, who was serving the first of a two-game suspension following an altercation with a fan at Detroit last week.",
      "Pittsburgh's game plan though seemed to be more geared to making sure Garrett didn't set the sack record against the Steelers than trying to wrap up a playoff spot.",
      "Garrett finished with a team-high six pressures on 39 pass rushes. He was chip-blocked or double-teamed 16 times. When the All-Pro was single covered, the Steelers either had Rodgers roll out to the opposite side or he threw a quick pass.",
      "\u201cThey kind of fell into the same line of thinking that the Packers did (in Week 3). You know, we\u2019ll just throw everything at them and see if we can muster effort to win without it,\u201d Garrett said.",

Denzel Ward blanketed Valdes-Scantling on a pass to the right corner of the end zone on fourth-and-goal with 17 seconds remaining as Pittsburgh turned it over on downs.",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\u201cThe existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\u201d said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court. The president also rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \u201cin line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\u201d",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",

      "Dec 15, 6:39 PM",
      "The new system will \u201cimplement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\u201d foreign workers, according to Tuesday\u2019s press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master\u2019s degree or higher.",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Bolivia\u2019s new government on Tuesday issued a decree that will allow global satellite internet companies such as Starlink or Kuiper to provide internet access across the Andean nation as it tries to upgrade its technology and speed up its notoriously slow connectivity rates.",
      "Bolivia\u2019s centrist President Rodrigo Paz signed the decree, which waives the restrictions placed on international satellite companies by the socialist administration of his predecessor, Luis Arce.",
      "Last year, Arce\u2019s government refused to grant a license to SpaceX, which owns Starlink, to operate in Bolivia, citing data protection and national sovereignty concerns.",
      "For years, Bolivia has tried to improve internet access in remote areas with a satellite purchased from China during the government of left-wing leader Evo Morales. When the satellite was acquired in 2013, Morales promised it would \u201cenlighten the people, after years of living in obscurity.\"",
      "However, the Chinese satellite, known as the Tupac Katari, failed to significantly speed up internet connections on mobile phones or in homes, because it relies on geostationary technology and orbits Earth at a distance of about 35,000 kilometers (about 21,800 miles) from the surface.",
      "In contrast, satellites used by Starlink orbit the planet at a distance of 550 kilometers (some 340 miles). Modern satellites used by Starlink and its competitors stay closer to Earth, which enables them to transmit data at faster rates.",
      "A report published in November by Ookla, a connectivity intelligence company, found that Bolivia had the slowest internet speed for mobile phones and fixed broadband in South America. Brazil is the regional leader in internet speed.",

      "\u201cWe became spectators while the rest of the world advanced,\u201d said Paz, who was elected in October. \u201cBut that is over. With new technologies we will be able to make up for lost time.\u201d",
      "Paz also said international companies \u2014 including Tesla, Amazon, Tether and Orcacle \u2014 plan to invest in data centers that Bolivia will set up near the cities of El Alto and Cochambamba.",
      "The president has been trying to draw international investment to Bolivia, as part of an effort to overcome an economic crisis, characterized by severe shortages of U.S. dollars.",
      "Earlier this week, Paz signed a decree to eliminate fuel subsidies that had hobbled public finances and worsened the dollar shortages. Labor unions across the Andean nation took to the streets on Monday to protest the elimination of the fuel subsidies.",

      "Lopez, a 41-year-old nurse who lives in Bakersfield, California, didn\u2019t know she was pregnant with her second child until days before giving birth.",
      "When her belly began to grow earlier this year, she thought it was her ovarian cyst getting bigger. Doctors had been monitoring the mass since her 20s, leaving it in place after removing her right ovary and another cyst.",
      "Lopez experienced none of the usual pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness, and never felt kicks. Though she didn\u2019t have a period, her cycle is irregular and she sometimes goes years without one.",
      "For months, she and her husband, Andrew Lopez, went about their lives and traveled abroad.",
      "But gradually, the pain and pressure in her abdomen got worse, and Lopez figured it was finally time to get the 22-pound (10-kilogram) cyst removed. She needed a CT scan, which required a pregnancy test first because of the radiation exposure. To her great surprise, the test came back positive.",
      "Lopez shared the news with her husband at a Dodgers baseball game in August, handing him a package with a note and a onesie.",
      "\u201cI just saw her face,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand she just looked like she wanted to weep and smile and cry at the same time.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the game, Lopez began feeling unwell and sought help at Cedars-Sinai. It turned out she had dangerously high blood pressure, which the medical team stabilized. They also did blood work and gave her an ultrasound and an MRI. The scans found that her uterus was empty, but a nearly full-term fetus in an amniotic sac was hiding in a small space in her abdomen, near her liver.",
      "\u201cIt did not look like it was directly invading any organs,\u201d Ozimek said. \u201cIt looked like it was mostly implanted on the sidewall of the pelvis, which is also very dangerous but more manageable than being implanted in the liver.\u201d",
      "Dr. Cara Heuser, a maternal-fetal specialist in Utah not involved with the case, said almost all pregnancies that implant outside the uterus \u2014 called ectopic pregnancies \u2014 go on to rupture and hemorrhage if not removed. Most commonly, they occur in the fallopian tubes.",

      "Many retirement developments serve as a tranquil refuge for older people who can no longer traveling to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures",
      "LOS GATOS, Calif. -- Like many retirement communities, The Terraces serves as a tranquil refuge for a nucleus of older people who no longer can travel to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures.",
      "But they can still be thrust back to their days of wanderlust and thrill-seeking whenever caretakers at the community in Los Gatos, California, schedule a date for residents \u2014 many of whom are in their 80s and 90s \u2014 to take turns donning virtual reality headsets.",
      "Within a matter of minutes, the headsets can transport them to Europe, immerse them in the ocean depths or soar them on breathtaking hang-gliding expeditions while they sit by each other. The selection of VR programming was curated by Rendever, a company that has turned a sometimes isolating form of technology into a catalyst for better cognition and social connections in 800 retirement communities in the United States and Canada.",
      "A group of The Terraces residents who participated in a VR session earlier this year found themselves paddling their arms alongside their chairs as they swam with a pod of dolphins while watching one of Rendever's 3D programs. \u201cWe got to go underwater and didn't even have to hold our breath!\u201d exclaimed 81-year-old Ginny Baird following the virtual submersion.",
      "During a session featuring a virtual ride in a hot-air balloon, one resident gasped, \u201cOh my God!\u201d Another shuddered, \u201cIt's hard to watch!\u201d",
      "The Rendever technology can also be used to virtually take older adults back to the places where they grew up as children. For some, it will be the first time they've seen their hometowns in decades.",
      "A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in Silicon Valley about 55 miles south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt isn't just about being able to see it again, it's about all the memories that it brings back,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cThere are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Adrian Marshall, The Terraces' community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out \u2014 even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that's popular in the community.",
      "\u201cIt turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,\u201d Marshall said of Rendever's VR programming. \u201cIt helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.\u201d",
      "Rendever, a privately owned company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers.",
      "Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk of too much screen time,\" Katherine \u201cKate\u201d Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. \u201cBut if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.\u201d",

      "VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults.",
      "\u201cThe stereotypes that older adults aren\u2019t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,\u201d Bhowmick said. \"Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, \u2018Grandpa is cool!\u2019\"",
      "Rendever CEO Kyle Rand's interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWhat really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,\u201d Rand said. \u201cA group of elderly residents who don't really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.\u201d",
      "It's a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities.",
      "Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That's how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology.",
      "Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years.",
      "Sallie Rogallo, who doesn't have dementia, said the experience brought back fond memories of the couple's visits to the same park during the more than 30 years they spent cruising around the U.S. in their recreational vehicle.",
      "\u201cIt made me wish I was 30 years younger so I could do it again,\u201d she said of the virtual visit to Glacier. \u201cThis lets you get out of the same environment and either go to a new place or visit places where you have been.\u201d",
      "In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset.",
      "\u201cThat was quite a session we had there,\u201d Schultz said with a big grin after she took off her headset and returned to reality.",

      "LONDON -- Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev praised U.S. President Donald Trump's \"peace efforts\" after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the White House on Sunday to discuss a possible peace deal to end Russia's full-scale invasion of the country.",
      "\"The whole world appreciates President Trump and his team's peace efforts,\" Dmitriev, who also serves as the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and has been closely involved in negotiations with U.S. representatives, said in a post to X.",
      "Dmitriev also posted criticism of what he called \"UK/EU warmongers\" for their continued backing of Ukraine, echoing the established Kremlin narrative that seeks to frame U.S. diplomatic efforts as being undermined by NATO and European allies.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy met at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone, according to Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov. The call was \"organized at the initiative of Trump,\" Ushakov said, as quoted by Russia's state-run Tass news agency.",
      "After his meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters that the negotiating teams are \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to achieving a peace deal to end Russia's full-scale invasion, which Moscow launched in February 2022.",
      "\"We had a terrific meeting. We discussed a lot of things. As you know, I had an excellent phone call with President Putin that lasted for over two hours. We discussed a lot of points, and I do think we're getting a lot closer,\" Trump said.",

      "Russia wants Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the entirety of the Donbas -- which is formed of Donetsk and Luhansk regions -- in exchange for a peace deal. Zelenskyy has instead proposed a \"demilitarized zone\" covering the area.",
      "Trump also again dismissed the idea of an immediate ceasefire to facilitate subsequent peace negotiations, which Ukraine has repeatedly proposed. Instead, Trump indicated sympathy with Putin's demand for a full peace deal before any halt to the fighting.",
      "\"He feels that look, you know, they're fighting and to stop and then, if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn't want to be in that position,\" Trump said of Putin. \"I understand that position.\"",
      "Zelenskyy nonetheless gave a positive readout of his White House visit in subsequent posts to social media.",
      "\"Thank you to President Trump and his team for the negotiations,\" he wrote on Telegram. \"Thank you to the United States for their support. Together, we have and can implement our vision of a series of steps towards peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy described the talks as \"a wonderful meeting,\" which included \"a meaningful discussion on all issues and highly appreciate the progress made by the Ukrainian and American teams over the past few weeks.\"",

      "\"We discussed all aspects of the peace framework and achieved significant results. We also discussed the sequence of further actions,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "\"We agree that security guarantees are key to achieving lasting peace, and our teams will continue to work on all aspects. We agreed that our teams will meet next week to finalize all discussed issues,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The New York City transit system is retiring the MetroCard after more than 30 years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the MetroCard replaced the New York City subway token in 1994, the swipeable plastic card infused much-needed modernity into one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest transit systems.",
      "Now, more than three decades later, the gold-hued fare card and its notoriously finicky magnetic strip are following the token into retirement.",
      "The last day to buy or refill a MetroCard is Dec. 31, 2025, as the transit system fully transitions to OMNY, a contactless payment system that allows riders to tap their credit card, phone or other smart device to pay fares, much like they do for other everyday purchases.",
      "Transit officials say more than 90% of subway and bus trips are now paid using the tap-and-go system, introduced in 2019.",
      "Major cities around the world, including London and Singapore, have long used similar contactless systems. In the U.S., San Francisco launched a pay-go system earlier this year, joining Chicago and others.",
      "The humble MetroCard may have outlasted its useful life, but in its day it was revolutionary, says Jodi Shapiro, curator at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn, which opened an exhibit earlier this month reflecting on the MetroCard\u2019s legacy.",
      "Before MetroCards, bus and subway riders relied on tokens, the brass-colored coins introduced in 1953 that were purchased from station booths. When the subway opened in 1904, paper tickets cost just a nickel, or about $1.82 in today\u2019s dollars.",
      "\u201cThere was a resistance to change from tokens to something else because tokens work,\u201d Shapiro said on a recent visit to the museum, housed underground in a decommissioned subway station. \u201cMetroCards introduced a whole other level of thinking for New Yorkers.\u201d",
      "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched public campaigns to teach commuters how to swipe the originally blue-colored cards correctly, hoping to avoid the dreaded error message or lost fares. Officials even briefly toyed with the idea of an quirky mascot, the Cardvaark, before coming to their senses.",
      "The cards quickly became collectors items as the transit system rolled out special commemorative editions marking major events, such as the \u201cSubway Series\u201d between baseball\u2019s New York Mets and the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series. At the time, a fare cost $1.50.",
      "Artists from David Bowie and Olivia Rodrigo to seminal New York hip hop acts, such as the Wu-Tang Clan, the Notorious B.I.G. and LL Cool J, have also graced the plastic card over the years, as have iconic New York shows like Seinfeld and Law & Order.",
      "\u201cFor me, the most special cards are cards which present New York City to the world,\u201d said Lev Radin, a collector in the Bronx. \u201cNot only photos of landmarks, skylines, but also about people who live and make New York special.\u201d",
      "Perfecting the correct angle and velocity of the MetroCard swipe also became something of a point of pride separating real New Yorkers from those just visiting.",
      "During her failed 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Senator from New York, took an excruciating five swipes at a Bronx turnstile. In fairness, her chief Democratic opponent at the time, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a native Brooklynite, didn't even appear to realize tokens had been discontinued.",

      "President Donald Trump says Ukraine and Russia are \u201ccloser than ever before\u201d to a peace deal, but he acknowledges that negotiations could still break down and leave the war dragging on for years",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump on Sunday insisted Ukraine and Russia are \u201ccloser than ever before\u201d to a peace deal as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, but he acknowledged the negotiations are complex and could still break down, leaving the war dragging on for years.",
      "The president\u2019s statements came after the leaders met for talks following what Trump said was an \u201cexcellent,\u201d two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war nearly four years ago. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.",
      "\u201cRussia wants to see Ukraine succeed,\u201d Trump said during a late afternoon news conference as he stood with Zelenskyy after their meeting. He repeatedly praised his counterpart as \u201cbrave.\u201d",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure it's not invaded again in the future. After their discussion, they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland.",
      "Zelenskyy said Trump had agreed to host European leaders again, possibly at the White House, sometime in January. Trump said the meeting could be in Washington or \u201csomeplace.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his work. \u201cUkraine is ready for peace,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side and was \u201cfriendly, benevolent and businesslike.\u201d Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again \u201cpromptly\u201d after Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "But Ushakov added that a \u201cbold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv\u201d on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a \u201ccomplete cessation\u201d of hostilities.",
      "Both leaders identified deciding the future of the Donbas region as a major sticking point.",
      "Trump said the parties were inching closer to agreement. \u201cThat's a very tough issue but one that I think will get resolved,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said: \u201cOur attitude is very clear. That's why President Trump said this is a very tough question and, of course, we have with Russia different positions on it.\u201d",
      "Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is \u201cvery serious\u201d about ending the war, even as Russia continued striking targets in Ukraine as Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. Trump said, \u201cI believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also.\u201d",
      "He held out the possibility that negotiations could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cIn a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think,\" Trump said. \"We could have something where one item that you\u2019re not thinking about is a big item, breaks it up. Look, it\u2019s been a very difficult negotiation. Very detailed.\u201d",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy's sit-down underscored the apparent progress made by Trump\u2019s top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans to end the fighting. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is \u201cabout 90% ready\u201d \u2014 echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump\u2019s chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin this month.",
      "During the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country\u2019s bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.",

Gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day. Indeed, on Sunday, Trump referred multiple times to the complexity of the negotiations.",
      "After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and \u201cstop at the battle line,\u201d implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.",
      "Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow\u2019s forces haven\u2019t captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.",

      "Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -\u2013 one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region \u2014 even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.",

      "HONOLULU -- Mike Lambert heard fewer illegal fireworks exploding in his suburban Honolulu neighborhood in the months after a chain of blasts at a house party last New Year's Eve led to the deaths of six people, including a 3-year-old boy.",
      "As the director of Hawaii's Department of Law Enforcement, Lambert wondered if the tragedy had sparked a shift in Hawaii residents' penchant for igniting illegal fireworks. In some neighborhoods, it would be common to hear loud booms any time of day or night \u2014 for sporting events, celebrations or no apparent reason at all.",
      "But this year, authorities are armed with stiffer laws created in the wake of the tragedy and will be giving out citations to offenders, Lambert warned.",
      "\u201cWe have no delusions that you can have a tragedy New Year\u2019s, you can sign a law in July and then not have anything go off the following year,\u201d he said. Still, he expects that some people will decide not to set off fireworks, either because of last year's deadly accident or the stepped-up enforcement and new laws.",
      "\u201cBefore, you could shoot it off with impunity,\u201d said state Rep. Scot Matayoshi, who authored two of the five anti-fireworks bills. \u201cEveryone knew they weren\u2019t going to bust you.\u201d",
      "Police can now issue $300 tickets to those who shoot off fireworks, while repeat offenders and people whose actions cause serious injury or death could get prison time for felony crimes.",
      "Matayoshi said he began working on legislation the morning after the tragedy, which took place at a New Year's Eve 2025 celebration when crates of illegal fireworks tipped over and ignited in the Aliamanu neighborhood, illuminating the sky in a terrifying set of explosions that left more than a dozen people with severe burns.",
      "\u201cIt affected me a lot,\u201d Matayoshi said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being the neighbor of someone who had basically bombs in their house going off and hurting and killing my kids.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Two sisters testified at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s most recent criminal trial. Kaja Sokola accused the disgraced movie mogul of sexual assault. Ewa Sokola was called as a witness to boost her claims, but ultimately ended up helping the defense.",
      "Now, Ewa Sokola is suing Kaja for defamation, alleging in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that the psychotherapist and ex-model\u2019s public remarks amount to libel and are damaging Ewa\u2019s reputation and business as a cardiologist in Poland.",
      "Ewa Sokola says that her younger sister has made false statements subjecting her to public hatred, shame, contempt, ridicule, ostracism and disgrace in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland. She seeks unspecified damages.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left for Kaja Sokola\u2019s lawyers and spokesperson on Thursday and Friday.",
      "In a split verdict in June, Weinstein was convicted of forcibly performing oral sex on film and television production assistant and producer Miriam Haley and acquitted on a charge involving Kaja Sokola\u2019s allegations of similar conduct. Both women said they were assaulted in 2006.",
      "The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "Weinstein has not yet been sentenced as a judge weighs a defense request to throw out the verdict after two jurors told Weinstein\u2019s lawyers that other jurors had bullied them into convicting him. Judge Curtis Farber is expected to rule on Jan. 8.",

      "Weinstein had arranged for Kaja Sokola to be an extra for a day in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries,\u201d and separately agreed to meet her and Ewa. After they chatted, she testified, Weinstein told her he had a script to show her in his hotel room, and she went up with him. There, she said, Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and assaulted her.",
      "After the trial, Kaja Sokola criticized her sister's testimony, saying that though she was called as a prosecution witness, she ended up serving Weinstein's cause by providing his lawyers with a journal in which she wrote about the men who had sexually assaulted her in her life but did not include Weinstein.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Kaja Sokola repeatedly characterized her sister's testimony as a personal \u201cbetrayal\" and falsely accused her of omitting journals in which she described what happened with Weinstein.",
      "The lawsuit also said Kaja Sokola had falsely accused Ewa Sokola of homicide, theft, falsification of medical records, sexual impropriety and immoral conduct, and of colluding with Weinstein's defense team.",
      "The lawsuit said Kaja Sokola's false claims have cost Ewa Sokola referrals and led to a reduction in patients and employees for her medical practice while damaging her professional reputation and her standing within the medical community.",

    "story": [
      "Hawaii's Big Island is banning people from feeding feral cats in an effort to protect native species, including an endangered goose",
      "KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii -- Throngs of feral cats emerge from the shade of parked trucks and bushes as soon as the familiar Subaru Forester pulls into a dump on Hawaii's Big Island. They run after the vehicle to a certain meal \u2014 a gravy train that might not be around much longer.",
      "A Hawaii County law set to take effect at the start of the new year bans feeding feral animals on county property. It's an effort to protect native species, such as an endangered goose called the nene, from a super predator introduced to the islands by Europeans in the 18th century.",
      "But the measure doesn't sit well with many cat lovers, including the driver of the Subaru, Liz Swan, who has been feeding feral felines on the Big Island for 33 years.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the cats should be exterminated at the expense of the nene,\u201d Swan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both living creatures.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how many feral cats \u2014 abandoned pets and their descendants \u2014 live on the Big Island. Estimates range well into the tens of thousands, with pockets of dense colonies supported by people. Opponents of the ban say it will hamper their efforts to contain the population by trapping and neutering the animals \u2014 and that hungry cats will then have to hunt for food.",
      "About 200 cats live at the Kealakehe Transfer Station and Recycling Center, not far from the bustling tourist district of Kona. Swan shows up every late afternoon with water and kibble, and says she's never seen a nene anywhere near the dump. Despite living amid trash, the cats there generally appear robust, most of them missing the tip of an ear, indicating they\u2019ve been spayed or neutered.",
      "The cats threaten the native species directly \u2014 by killing them \u2014 and indirectly, biologists say. Food left out for the cats can attract native animals, bringing them into closer contact with humans. Cat feces can also spread a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that has killed endangered Hawaiian monk seals and native birds.",
      "Last year, a male nene \u2014 pronounced \u201cneh-neh\u201d \u2014 was struck and killed by a car as it crossed a road in Hilo, on the eastern side of the island, to reach a cat feeding station. The goose's surviving mate, which also had a gosling die of toxoplasmosis in 2024, has recently taken on another partner and is nesting in a Hilo park, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources announced this month.",
      "The county's feeding ban will help protect them, the department said.",
      "State wildlife biologist Raymond McGuire recently checked for nene nesting sites among the barren black-rock fields near a shopping center at the Waikoloa resort. It's not their traditional habitat, but he has seen the geese fly in to grab food \u2014 risking getting hit by cars \u2014 and last year some nested there.",
      "As he approached, a pair of feline eyes peered out of a crack in the lava rock. Cats emerged from their nooks, perhaps mistaking him for someone who might offer food.",
      "McGuire was relieved to see there were no nene nearby \u2014 but frustrated with evidence the cats are being fed: empty water bowls and aluminum pans.",
      "He's a cat owner \u2014 \"my favorite animal is a cat\" \u2014 but as a Hawaiian whose love of nature inspired him to pursue conservation work, he believes there is no room for them where native species are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cThere's so many birds that my kids will never see, that I got to see,\u201d he said, referring to native forest birds. \u201cI think about my ancestors and I do wonder: Are we honoring them well in what we do? Because they did take steps to protect them.\u201d",
      "Feral cats are a problem in many places, but Hawaii's sensitive ecosystem is full of species that evolved without mammalian predators, making them especially vulnerable, McGuire said.",
      "Hawaiian culture is closely tied to Hawaii\u2019s animals; aumakua, or ancestral spirit guides, can take animal form, noted Big Island Mayor Kimo Alameda. His family's aumakua is the shark, he said.",

      "A mysterious group called Georgians for Integrity has spent around $5 million on television ads, mailers and texts attacking Lt. Gov. Burt Jones since November",
      "ATLANTA -- It's the biggest mystery in Georgia politics right now: Who's paying for the attacks on Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones?",
      "Someone operating under the name \u201cGeorgians for Integrity\u201d has dumped around $5 million into television ads, mailers and texts. The attacks claim Jones, who already has President Donald Trump's endorsement in his run for governor next year, has been using his office to enrich himself.",
      "For any Georgian settling down to watch a football game, the ads have been nearly inescapable since Thanksgiving. They're the opening shot in the public battle for the Republican nomination that will be settled in May's primary election. But the ads also show how dark money is influencing politics not only at the national level but in the states, with secretive interests dropping big sums seeking to shift public opinion.",
      "The Jones campaign is hopping mad, threatening legal action against television stations if they don\u2019t stop airing ads that a lawyer calls \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d and slanderous.",
      "So far, the ads remain on air.",
      "\u201cThey want to be anonymous, spend a lot of money, and create a lot of lies about myself and my family,\u201d Jones told WSB-AM in an interview Dec. 16, calling the ads \u201cfabricated trash.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Jones\u2019 top rivals for the Republican nomination, say they are not involved in the attacks. All three want to succeed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who can\u2019t run again because of term limits. There are also multiple Democrats vying for the state\u2019s top office.",
      "The Georgia Republican Party has filed a complaint with the State Ethics Commission. The GOP claims the ads violate Georgia\u2019s campaign finance law against spending on an election without registering and disclosing donors.",
      "\u201cI think there are far-reaching consequences to allowing this activity to go forward unchecked,\u201d state Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd the consequences are much broader than the outcome of the May primary.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a further filtering down of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, which led to dramatic increases in independent spending in U.S. elections, said Shanna Ports, senior legal counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, which seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics.",
      "\u201cDark money is becoming more and more the norm in races, up and down the ballot, and at early times,\u201d Ports said.",

But things escalated after Georgians for Integrity was incorporated in Delaware on Nov. 24, according to that state's corporation records. The entity identifies itself as a nonprofit social welfare organization under the federal tax code, a popular way to organize campaign spending that lets a group hide its donors.",
      "The Jones campaign says the ad falsely leads viewers to believe that Jones enabled government to take land through eminent domain to help support his family\u2019s interest in a massive data center development in Jones\u2019 home county south of Atlanta. As a state senator, Jones did vote for a 2017 law that opened a narrow exception in Georgia\u2019s law prohibiting governments from conveying property seized through condemnation proceedings to private developers. But eminent domain isn't being used to benefit the $10 billion development that government filings show could include 11 million square feet (1 million square meters) of data centers.",
      "Georgians for Integrity lists its local address as a mailbox at an Atlanta office supply store east on some paperwork submitted to television stations. A media buyer named Alex Roberts, with a Park City, Utah, address, is also listed on those papers, but he hasn't responded to an email from the AP. Neither has Kimberly Land, a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer listed on incorporation papers. After weeks of heavy spending, no one has proved who's providing the cash.",
      "The Republican Party contends Georgians for Integrity is an independent committee under Georgia law. That means it can raise and spend unlimited sums, but must register before accepting contributions and must disclose its donors.",
      "But that law identifies such committees as expending \u201cfunds either for the purpose of affecting the outcome of an election for any elected office or to advocate the election or defeat of any particular candidate.\u201d And the ads targeting Jones don't ever identify him as running for governor or mention the 2026 elections, instead urging viewers to call Jones and \u201cTell Burt, stop profiting off taxpayers.\u201d",
      "But McKoon said those are \u201csemantic games\u201d and that regular voters would definitely think the ads are designed to influence them.",
      "\u201cIf you are funding a message that is designed to impact an election \u2014 and I think it strains credulity to argue that that is not the case here \u2014 then you ought to have to comply with the campaign finance laws that the legislature has seen fit to pass,\u201d McKoon said.",

      "The New Year's Eve ball drop in New York City will sparkle in red, white, and blue to kick off celebrations for the U.S.'s 250th birthday in 2026",
      "When the ball drops on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York City, it will sparkle in red, white and blue, ushering in 2026 and kicking off months of celebrations for the nation\u2019s upcoming 250th birthday.",
      "The patriotic touches at this year's Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what\u2019s ahead: hundreds of events and programs, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, whatever you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s going to be much more than that,\u201d said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organize the semiquincentennial anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from where the ball is dropped, to make the changes to this year's ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop July 3, the eve of the nation's birthday, \u201cin the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it,\" Rios said.",
      "It will mark the first time in 120 years there will be ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year's Eve, she said.",
      "A New Year\u2019s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogram), 5-foot- (1.5-meter-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilograms).",
      "The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly \u201cdimout\u201d during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.",

      "Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer who assisted in the case, said Guan Heng's lawyer received a letter from DHS stating its decision to withdraw its request to send Guan to Uganda. Asat said she now expects Guan\u2019s asylum case to \u201cproceed smoothly and favorably.\u201d",

      "Martha turned and fled through the crowd, down the wide flight of stone steps, and out into Beaumont Street, looking at nothing but the ground. Three corners later, she found a side road and turned into it. She put her back against the wall and tried to breathe.",
      "She had known there would be ghosts in Oxford. She wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her. There had been times in the first year after her sister's disappearance when Martha's heart would stop as she spotted her through the crowd: the long blond hair, the shapeless cardigan draped over a thin cotton dress. She'd hear a laugh, throaty and sudden, or catch a movement, a walk, a twist in the shoulders, and she'd be certain. Just for a moment. Then the illusion would shatter, and the person she knew to be her sister would resolve into a stranger.",
      "As the years passed, so the ghost of Charlie aged. Now it was women in their midthirties who made Martha stop dead in the streets. In Berlin, once a month perhaps, she'd felt that same flickering certainty before realizing the woman with a child on her lap as she drank a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 was not her sister, just an echo of Martha's own image of who Charlie might be now, thirteen years after fleeing Oxford and her family.",
      "Martha pressed her palm against the wall behind her. She reminded herself of her therapist's mantra for the moments when she was in danger of being overwhelmed. What can you see now? The shiny cobbles of the side street, the white brick of the wall opposite. What can you feel? The bricks under my fingers, a breeze ruffling my hair. What can you smell? Cooking oil, the Black Opium perfume I put on this morning.",
      "Her breathing slowed.",
      "She pulled the letter out of her bag again and stared at it. Could it be from Charlie? Impossible. What could this Chorus know? Should she burn it? Throw it in the river? Take it to the police?",
      "Ah, the police. She heard the scrape of her mother's chair on the kitchen floor as she leaped up at the sound of the doorbell. They had found Charlie's bike not far from the ring road. Did she hitchhike? How was her PhD going? Martha couldn't remember their faces, just their hands around tea mugs as they sat at the table, the low rumble of their voices as they talked about stress and pressure. Most runaways come back in time, they'd said. They left literature, helpline numbers, and world-weary sympathy behind them.",
      "Martha realized she was at her own front door. Her body had picked her up and carried her here through the gathering dark. She looked up. All the lights were off; her father must be in bed.",
      "Charlie had been living here when she went missing, taking advantage of the space, their mum's cooking, and the glow of parental approval while she slogged through her PhD. Martha had just left for university and was starting to experiment with life out of Charlie's orbit.",
      "As she put her key in the lock, she remembered Alex's shadow moving across the folded letter at the museum. Now it was Charlie's. Always here: the shadows of the past thrown against the walls and floors. She pushed open the door\u2026.",

      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",

      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure.

    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "summary": "It marks the second lawsuit in recent months accusing the filmmaker and studio mogul of leveraging his power in Hollywood to make sexual advances.",
    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry was sued for sexual assault by an actor who appeared in \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" marking the second lawsuit in recent months accusing the filmmaker and studio mogul of leveraging his power in Hollywood to make sexual advances.",
      "Mario Rodriguez filed the lawsuit Thursday in California, alleging Perry subjected him to repeated unwanted sexual advances over several years, including sexual battery and assault at Perry's Los Angeles home. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million in damages and also has sued Lionsgate, which distributed the 2016 film, accusing the studio of turning a blind eye to Perry's alleged misconduct.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" telling him, \"I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "After Rodriguez was cast, he was invited to Perry's home, where Perry allegedly touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit describes additional alleged incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly attempted to unbuckle Rodriguez's pants and another in which Perry placed Rodriguez's hand on his genitals. The complaint says Perry gave Rodriguez $5,000 on multiple occasions following the encounters.",
      "Rodriguez says he resisted the advances and ultimately decided to file suit after learning of similar allegations made by another actor, Derek Dixon.",
      "Dixon sued Perry in June, alleging the filmmaker groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit, which was originally filed in L.A. Superior Court, has reportedly since been moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry's studio is based.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit includes claims of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",
      "Westminster Abbey, in the heart of London, is where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, and it has also been the site of numerous royal weddings.",
      "The speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, including scenes from the king's historic trip to the Vatican, where he prayed with\u00a0Pope Leo XIV in an effort to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",
      "During last year's Christmas address, Charles honored care workers around the country and gave a special thanks to the doctors and nurses who supported him after his cancer diagnosis.",
      "Catherine, Princess of Wales, also underwent treatment for cancer last year. She said in January that she was in remission\u00a0after going through some \"hard times\" during her recovery. Kate, as she is widely called, has not shared details about what type of cancer it was.",
      "She and her husband Prince William, the\u00a0heir to the throne, have three children: 12-year-old Prince George of Wales, 10-year-old Princess Charlotte of Wales and 7-year-old Prince Louis of Wales.",

      "President Trump's administration has made sweeping changes to the Kennedy Center, including ousting the chairman of its board of trustees and its president, and installing in their place Mr. Trump and one of his allies, former Ambassador Richard Grenell. Last week, the White House announced the board had voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.",
      "This year's Kennedy Center Honors, which was recorded earlier this month, marks Mr. Trump's first appearance at the annual event in his two terms in office. He also hosted the celebration, a departure from past years when presidents would sit with the honorees and watch the show.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post\u00a0Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump promoted the broadcast, saying it will be \"honoring true GREATS in the History of Entertainment.\" He also wrote: \"Tell me what you think of my 'Master of Ceremony' abilities. If really good, would you like me to leave the Presidency in order to make 'hosting' a full time job?\"",
      "Who are the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors recipients?",
      "Mr. Trump announced the list of this year's honorees over the summer. They are:",

      "George Strait, the King of Country Music",
      "With hits like \"All My Ex's Live in Texas,\" \"Amarillo by Morning\" and \"Check Yes or No,\" George Strait is known as the King of Country Music.",
      "The multiplatinum artist has won dozens of awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, as well as a Grammy for best country album. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006.",
      "When Strait received a lifetime achievement award from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2021, he said his father taught him the ways of the cowboy life and that he's tried to hold on to his Western heritage throughout his career. But he also said he was challenged early on to stay true to himself.",
      "\"When I first signed with MCA Records in 1981, you know, they, all the people, were going, 'Take the hat off,'\" he said, pointing at his trademark 10-gallon cowboy hat with a grin. \"Now, can you imagine if I would have done that?\"",
      "A producer also floated the idea that Strait change his name. \"My dad was so glad I didn't do that,\" Strait said.",
      "Gloria Gaynor, the Queen of Disco",
      "Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\" has stood the test of time, surviving far longer than disco did and crowning the New Jersey singer as the genre's queen.",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording. When it was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2016, the library said \"I Will Survive\" became known as an \"emblem of women's empowerment\" and an anthem in the LGBTQ community.",
      "\"That song taps into the inherent survival instinct and it taps into the tenacity of the human spirit,\" Gaynor told CBS News in 2016.",
      "As she recalled recently, when she recorded the hit, she was paralyzed from the waist down while recovering from a serious spinal injury after a fall onstage.",
      "\"I had been in hospital for over three months, hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I'd survive the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior,\" Gaynor said. \"Yeah, I was living that song, and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one.\"",
      "Legendary rock band Kiss",
      "This year's celebration is a bittersweet moment for the founding members of Kiss. Ace Frehley, the band's original lead guitarist, died in October, just a few weeks after he, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were named among this year's honorees.",
      "\"The saddest thing of all is that Ace couldn't live long enough to see this amazing thing,\" Simmons told CBS News.",
      "Kiss is known as much for their hits like \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" and \"Detroit Rock City\" as they are for their signature black-and-white face paint. The group rode the glam rock wave to stardom, selling more than 100 million records worldwide and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "Simmons and Stanley's partnership has lasted for decades, overcoming the difficulties of making it in the music business.",
      "\"I don't think it's a coincidence that both of us are Jewish and from immigrants who experienced the Holocaust,\" Stanley told CBS News. \"I think that innately we have inside us compassion for other people but also a sense of survival.\"",
      "Tony winner Michael Crawford",
      "Famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber picked Michael Crawford to play the titular role in the long-running musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\" when it first opened in London in 1986.",
      "\"When he played to me the overture, the hair stood up on the back of my neck,\" Crawford told CBS News. \"I adored playing and creating it, building him.\"",
      "After winning an Olivier Award \u2014 the U.K. equivalent of the Tony Award \u2014 for musical of the year, the show opened on Broadway in New York in 1988, winning seven Tonys, including best actor in a musical for Crawford.",
      "Crawford's career has also included roles in movies and on television, but he considered those to be auditions for his next part. For him, playing the Phantom was a gift.",
      "\"So, you want to do the eight shows a week,\" Crawford said. \"You don't want to miss one.\"",
      "American icon Sylvester Stallone",
      "Sylvester Stallone wants people to understand one thing about his classic movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"Even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie,\" Stallone told CBS News. \"It's not. It's a love story. It starts with love.\"",
      "For Stallone, who received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa and writing the screenplay for what was named 1976's best picture, the film was about the love between Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian.",
      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",
      "New Kennedy Center Honors medallion",
      "The rainbow-colored ribbons adorned with three gold bars that have long been given to honorees were replaced this year with new gold medallions.",
      "Designed by Tiffany and Co., each medallion features an etching of the center on one side with rainbow colors running through it. The other side bears each honoree's name and when they received the award.",
      "Each medallion hangs from a ribbon that's navy blue, which the center described as \"a color associated with dignity and tradition.\"",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This content discusses allegations of sexual assault, which some may find distressing.",
      "Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day is opening up about a witness affidavit that alleged she was sexually assaulted by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "O'Day sat down with CBS News for her first network interview since Netflix's new documentary, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning,\" was released. A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesman for Combs said that the music mogul \"categorically denies the allegations in the Netflix documentary,\" saying that \"he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\" Combs plans to address these matters \"in the appropriate legal forum\" rather than \"speculation from anonymous affidavits,\" the statement continued. Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",
      "O'Day once worked closely with Combs, who helped found\u00a0Danity Kane\u00a0on his reality show \"Making the Band\" in 2005 before he ultimately disbanded the group in 2009. Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",
      "She wanted to make sure the person who wrote the affidavit is \"100 percent certain\" it was her and that they didn't confuse her with another bandmate or doppelg\u00e4nger.",
      "\"The story that they have told has been consistent for two years in every area that they've been in,\" O'Day said. To this day, O'Day still doesn't know what happened.",
      "O'Day has previously emphasized the role of forgiveness in her journey through the entertainment industry, saying that it starts with forgiving yourself.",
      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",
      "\"Do I forgive him? I don't think that matters to the bigger picture. I think that he needs to do the work to forgive himself,\" O'Day said.",
      "Right now, O'Day said her focus is going to remain on the survivors and pushing for systematic change.",
      "\"I want to be helping people, and speaking for the underdogs, and speaking for the voices that aren't being heard. And I didn't necessarily get to spend the majority of my life yet being able to live in my purpose,\" she said.",
      "Combs is expected to be\u00a0released from prison in May 2028, according to online prison records. While some rumors have swirled about the possibility of a presidential pardon, a senior White House official called the reports \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come directly from President Trump.",
      "Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Combs,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" in August\u00a0that he hasn't had any conversations about a possible pardon: \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "O'Day doesn't believe Mr. Trump would pardon Combs.",
      "\"I think the only reason, in my opinion, that the president would pardon 'Diddy' is if it worked well for him in midterms, in regards to gathering a certain voting base,\" she said. \"The moves are always strategic, and the moves right now are about midterms.\"",

      "Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that, as President Trump searches for a new chair of the Federal Reserve, maintaining the banking system's independence is paramount.",
      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

    "summary": "As many Americans head into 2026 with mounting money worries, reviewing your finances now could help put you on firmer footing next year.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are heading into 2026 with serious money worries as an affordability crisis collides with\u00a0stagnant wages, making it more important to take steps to shore up their finances.",
      "On top of that, a major tax overhaul is taking effect under Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" law, or OBBBA, creating opportunities to benefit from the new rules. Other financial changes, such as potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could also impact your bank account next year, experts say.",
      "About 84% of Americans have new financial resolutions for 2026, including building an emergency fund or opening a high-yield savings account, according to a recent Vanguard survey. That resolve may be spurred by growing unease about the year ahead. About one in three Americans thinks their finances are likely to worsen in 2026, according to Bankrate, the highest share since the personal finance firm began tracking sentiment in 2018.",
      "\"The last few weeks of the year are a great time to review your finances, especially around saving, and it's important to know how you might be impacted by the new tax law,\" Sabino Vargas, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor for Vanguard, told CBS News.",
      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record is the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot won in U.S. lottery history.",
      "Thirteen of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "The bigest one this year, Christmas Eve's $1.817 billion Powerball jackpot, is now the\u00a0second-largest U.S. jackpot ever won.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins before that:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. safety regulators have launched a probe into some Tesla Model 3 cars over the vehicle's door handles.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a December 23 online\u00a0filing\u00a0that it received a complaint from a Tesla owner asking it to investigate the vehicle's emergency door handles, with the motorist claiming that the \"mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled and not intuitive to locate during an emergency.\"",
      "The driver claimed he was forced to escape from the vehicle's rear window after the 2022 Model 3 caught fire, according to his account on an Atlanta local television news show.",
      "The probe covers roughly 179,000 Model 3 cars from the 2022 model year, according to the NHTSA filing.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This isn't the first time the Model 3 has come under scrutiny. In 2023, a couple crashed in Tacoma, Washington, after a design flaw in the Model 3 they were driving caused it to accelerate out of control. A separate issue with the door handle prevented bystanders from helping to rescue the couple, according to court filings. The accident killed the woman, Wendy Dennis, while leaving her husband, Jeff Dennis, severely injured.",
      "Other reports have also surfaced describing incidents in which people became trapped in a burning Tesla vehicle following an accident that allegedly incapacitated the electric doors, while occupants were unable to find a manual release.",
      "Bloomberg reported this week that there have been \"at least\" 15 deaths over the last decade in which motorists or rescuers were unable to open the doors of a Tesla that had crashed and caught fire.",

    "summary": "The new tourist tax imposes an 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers to address climate change threats to Hawaii.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge's ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help pay for the impacts of climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",
      "According to court records, the plaintiffs will appeal. They asked the judge to grant an injunction pending an appeal and requested a ruling by Saturday afternoon, given that the law takes effect Jan. 1.",
      "Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. government intervened in the case, calling the tax a \"scheme to extort American citizens and businesses solely to benefit Hawaii\" in conflict with federal law.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "story": [
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro, Calif. and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family's tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn't immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "A Navajo County grand jury indicted Michael Tuesday and deputies got an arrest warrant for him, CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reported.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region's early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri's forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",
      "The Abattis were sparring over finances, with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn't maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple's three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees, court filings show.",
      "\"I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\" she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn't afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700 and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\"The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\" Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti's family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \"The Morality of Deceit.\"",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The FDA's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "\"I do think that having an oral option would be really helpful, one for improving access, but also as another tool that we can offer patients,\" Dr. Reshmi Srinath, director of the Mount Sinai Weight and Metabolism Management Program in New York, told CBS News.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill.",
      "\"It was a great option, especially when I know I had tried to do things [in] what people may term 'the right way,' with diet and exercise alone,\" Mertens told CBS News.",
      "The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said. \"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it.\"",
      "Before he lost weight, Mertens said, \"I was also seeing effects with things like my blood pressure, with one of my doctors telling me I might need to start medicine for my blood pressure because it was getting high enough, as well as cholesterol being elevated.\"",
      "Participants in the\u00a0clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",

      "The Conference Board, a nonprofit group representing businesses, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December, from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",

      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing.

Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year. While inflation remains higher than the Fed would like, consumer prices have not risen as much as many economists initially feared after President Trump unveiled tariffs earlier this year. Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",

    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisory firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",
      "\"So goes gold, so goes silver: the end of the speculative boom in the former will also kill off the rally in the latter,\" Capital Economics said in the research note.",
      "Other analysts hold a more optimistic outlook. Yates said he expects lower interest rates and a potentially weak U.S. dollar to help boost the case for hard assets like silver into next year.",
      "\"Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of a broader precious metals rally and remain constructive on both gold and silver,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-ban-new-foreign-made-drones-china-balks/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Communications Commission says it's banning new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as the Trump administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014 The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Trump's administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
      "The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States' status as the world's largest humanitarian donor.",
      "The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.",
      "The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.",
      "Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.",
      "The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.",
      "The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations \u2014 the world's top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money \u2014 takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.",
      "Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change \u00a0have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.",
      "The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration, or even during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office \u2014 which last year set in motion a \"humanitarian reset\" to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent \u2014 will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.",
      "The United States wants to see \"more consolidated leadership authority\" in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.",
      "Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office \"are going to control the spigot\" on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.",
      "\"This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars \u2014 providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.",
      "U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.",
      "\"The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.\"",
      "\"Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.'s most critical work,\" the department added. \"Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.\"",
      "At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.",
      "One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Mr. Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.",
      "The project, months in the making, stems from Mr. Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise but has failed to live up to it and has, in his eyes, drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.",
      "Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, \"At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.",

      "So, you know, what they're telling you is what they feel. What they're actually seeing, is spending is reasonably solid \u2013 reasonably solid heading into the end of the year. And it's been kind of going along like that all of December.",
      "Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are \u2013 you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending. They have good credit quality. They are employed. And we can see wages growing in \u2013 as people's paychecks come in at a 3 percent clip. So it's a \u2013 it's pretty solid right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper-income brackets? Is it that K-shaped economy some people talk about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, our team puts the \u2013 looks at this.",
      "Yes, it \u2013 the growth rate difference is higher, but all of \u2013 all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and that's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low, but spending that's higher?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's \u2013 you hear about it. You've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that \u2013 because we had a very \u2013 a very strange process from '20 through to now.",
      "We had COVID lockdown. Then we had all the stimulus. Then we had high inflation. And then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's \u2013 they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times.",
      "And so they saw the inflation in '20 \u2013 in, yes, '20 and '23 and '24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist. And it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into '26, having come through '25, the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at it, they think inflation keeps working its way down.",
      "But it's \u2013 it's what people feel. And you can't discount that. And it's also, at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on.",
      "But \u2013 but it's \u2013 it's not widespread. At 4 \u2013 you know, 4.6 percent unemployment is the last number they published. That's still in the \u2013 in - - our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so, in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a big concern. But Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de-escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think, if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was shock. There was shock on liberation day.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There was shock, the size, sheer size, at the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera.",
      "What you have seen now, as time has moved on, it's sort of a 15 percent on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the U.S. or won't commit to lowering their non-tariff barriers and things like that.",
      "And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean or foreign CEOs, you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be \u2013 drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15 percent.",
      "To go from a 10 percent across the board to 15 percent, for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to \u2013 it's starting to de-escalate, in that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15 percent here, 17 \u2013 different numbers.",
      "When you put China, China's a different question, because of the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just A.I., all that stuff. It's a very different case.",
      "And I think also, between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly, in the world, you can see sort of the end point here, and now they've just got to \u2013 it's got to work through the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B-of-A is the largest small business lender.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender.",
      "And as you're \u2013 if we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very \u2013 because rates had gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow at floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them, I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit?",
      "But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit. So they're more \u2013 their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do \u2013 to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern.",
      "It's not that they agree with them or are disagree with them. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So, if you think across four policy regimes, tax, trade, tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation, you have seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability.",
      "How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable, they're here, so give me a set of rules and I will go play with them. But I need to be clarified of what the rules are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it.",
      "One is, the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So, if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that's slowing down that activity.",
      "The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country, some single-family \u2013 you could have single-family, multi \u2013 small multifloor units, things like that, or even more, bigger multifamily in major cities. But there's a universal housing shortage, because, for so many years, it's been hard to get housing permitted.",
      "And so the advice I give to anybody is, you're probably not going to see the 10-year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of 3, and but the 10-year rate stays between 4 and 4.5, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than it is today.",
      "But if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that. It's probably the solution.",
      "Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people with 3 percent mortgage rates, that's not going to be a change. And, by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low a rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession.",
      "So we shouldn't be cheering for 3 percent mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down as a good thing.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Because there's 60 million \u2013 there's 130-odd million households in America. Half of them don't have a mortgage. This is \u2013 this whole lock-in question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: \u2026 is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring \u2013 rental affordability is a question, or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that.",
      "So it's a very complex thing. But simplistic \u2013 simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie.",
      "Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The treasury secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake.",
      "Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But \u2013 but, for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, I don't talk about client relationships.",
      "But, look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And \u2013 and the administration knows that and Secretary Bessent knows it. That guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30-year mortgage, because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee, for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels there are more advantageous to borrow.",
      "You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be OK, or a lot of years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that guarantee is critical to the U.S. getting fixed- rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability.",
      "And then they've run the things pretty responsible since the financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason \u2013 one of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them.",
      "And as soon as rate \u2013 prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful of all that. And I think the \u2013 but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been.",
      "They're a great company. They're an iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May.",
      "How much does that job matter to the consumer? How do you explain that?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things.",
      "So the president's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's \u2013 he should do it.",
      "There's \u2013 in my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not \u2013 we're a country \u2013 we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer \u2013 all these people drive our economy.",
      "The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get \u2013 since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: That's what they're supposed to do. That went away a number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID.",
      "They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and prices. But, other than that, you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't worry about all this, you know, hand- wringing of political interference with the Fed once that new position is filled?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The market is a \u2013 will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And everybody knows that.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News and The Free Press have secured a partnership with Bank of America \"For Things That Matter,\" a series of town halls and debates designed to revive conversation on topics that matter the most.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with more of our interview with the chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You pushed back pretty hard in that moment.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six-page report.",
      "There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been \u2013 have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on.",
      "So, if you read the Web site, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was, that's not what was going \u2013 never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clearer, so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others.",
      "And we'll \u2013 we'll look at anybody who feels we \u2013 believe me, they \u2013 people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, you closed my account. Why? And we can tell them.",
      "But I think people are forgetting, the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And they \u2013 and, believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be \u2013 fail as a company, and, therefore, we're going to write you up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration, that kind of social pressure, you're saying?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Even 20 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty years ago. OK.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up.",
      "And the second thing is that \u2013 that, for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at $10,000. And you have two things. If it goes above that, you have to report on it and if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972.",
      "That number would be $80,000 today. So what we thought was material then\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and so there's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to \u2013 if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful.",
      "So there's sort of the ESG side of it. Those things, I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff, because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter, and then the reputation risk, which, to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this issue, the president himself really dug into. And he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, is \u2013 do you know what he's talking about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We \u2013 I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we banked everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it on television about you.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I know that. I know that. People \u2013 if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television, it \u2013 I would be rich. So, in the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers.",
      "We have tens of thousands \u2013 we are the biggest small business lender in the country, period, end, stop. You know, and so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's \u2013 it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their \u2013 and their points of view.",
      "But, look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center, and America ought to feel good about that.",

      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Good to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have heard so much in the past year about A.I., artificial intelligence, in virtually every sector of the business world and national security.",
      "You have said A.I., it's not just an app on your phone. It's not just a computer chip. It's energy. It's data centers. There are some really complex challenging \u2013 challenges here. What are you looking at in the year ahead?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, starting exactly there, just the diversity of sectors that are impacted by A.I., it is an incredibly complex global value chain.",
      "It's chips. We have heard a lot about the Nvidia H200 chips and then competing against Huawei in China. It is software.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying not to sell them to China and the debate over\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Right. Right. And there's a significant tension in the national security space on, should we give China chips or should we deprive them of chips?",
      "And it seems for now that the side that wants to give China chips and then extract value and revenue from it, that team has won for now. But, broader than that, there's software. There's infrastructure. There's data centers. There's water. There's thermal management. There is training. There's work force.",
      "So it is not just about the app that manifests on your phone. It's the entirety of the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's reshaping so many sectors of the economy.",

      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It's reshaping the way virtually every business operates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: If you go talk to CEOs, they're talking about how they can be an A.I.-first company. Are they happy with the results that they're seeing right now? Absolutely not. But they know, two years, we're going to face this equivalent of a Cambrian explosion of A.I. capabilities across the economy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And, Margaret, if I can just add, it's not just reshaping how businesses operate. It's also reshaping how governments operate.",
      "If you look at A.I., nothing is zero sum in national security. It's not a net positive or a net negative. A.I., and I have seen this firsthand, is changing the way that investigations are performed. It allows law enforcement officials to comb through so much data and to do investigations more efficiently.",
      "It is allowing the U.S. military to use certain autonomous vehicles and weapons that can reduce civilian risk, if managed appropriately, and more effectively engage in war fighting. It's changing the way the intelligence community is able to both collect and review data.",
      "At the same time, it is opening up a whole new host of threats. A.I. doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors. It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said something that was a little frightening to me. You said, as technology gets more advanced, the ability to anonymously hurt people exponentially increases.",
      "What does that mean on the homeland security front?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: A.I. gives actors, not just in the homeland, but literally all around the world, to very credibly pretend to be somebody else. It is upending the whole notion of what identity is in today's day and age.",
      "A.I. is allowing bad actors to very authentically and credibly pretend to be someone else, both with their voices, with their faces, and then to deliver threats in a way that actually resonates. So it's impersonating someone, but then also using A.I. to figure out where vulnerabilities are in a system and what a target audience or a target entity is going to respond to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want both of you to weigh in on this, but, Chris, we heard just last month the first documented case of a fully automated cyberattack by a foreign government. This was the A.I. chatbot Claude.",
      "They said the suspected Chinese hackers had used their A.I. to breach about 30 global organizations, just to do it really quickly and efficiently, as I understand it. So whose job is it to protect against it? Is it the government's job or is it a private corporation to figure out how to protect against all these risks you laid out?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think there are two things in play right now.",
      "One is, what's the regulatory environment look like that requires the safe use of these platforms? And we have seen a pullback on the regulatory front from this administration. The Biden administration had an A.I. executive order that required certain notifications and safety testings. That's been pulled back.",
      "Instead, we're in this innovation-first model. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was light touch. This is even \u2013 this is no touch, you're saying.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: This is \u2013 yes, I \u2013 again, this is really putting the full weight of the government behind the U.S. technology industry winning the global A.I. race. That is the top priority.",
      "And so what's happening in the meantime is, you would normally say, OK, the states are going to regulate, but now you have the White House weighing in saying states cannot regulate in the A.I. space. And, again, CEOs want some guidance. They want governance. So they have to do it themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, switching gears for a moment here, we're looking at 2026, a huge number of mass gatherings in the United States. You have got FIFA, World Cup, the Super Bowl, the nation's 250th anniversary. Are you concerned about homeland security in the new year?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: There are always a lot of threats facing the homeland. What is materially different in the coming year, in 2026, is that there are structural issues that I fear make us more vulnerable to successful attack.",
      "That includes the fact that the United States probably for the first time in our history is no longer viewed globally as the leader and poster child for rules-based international order. Other actors feel like they don't have to follow the rules if we're not going to. That could introduce new threats.",
      "At the same time, there has been a degradation in the systems of government that do identify threats and then work to prevent them, not just today, but over the medium and longer term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break here, come back on the other side of it. More \u2013 more things to worry about in the new year in just a minute.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Samantha Vinograd and Chris Krebs. Both are CBS contributors.",
      "Sam, you worked in Homeland Security under the Biden administration. And we heard at that time that the administration was just hamstrung unless Congress did something on the immigration front. This administration took a completely different approach. I mean let's just look at what they did this year. Mass deportation campaign. Significant change to legal immigration. Border crossings are now at the lowest level in decades. Secured major funding for ICE and CBP. Half a million arrests conducted. They repealed protected status for many immigrants. And now there's a travel ban or restrictions on about 39 countries total.",
      "What is the longer-term impact of these kind of really massive changes?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be clear, the Biden administration did take action in July of 2024 to try to curtail unlawful immigration. December 2023 we saw almost 250,000 individuals unlawfully crossing our border. By January of 2025, that was down about 85 percent before Biden took office \u2013 left office as a result of his executive order.",
      "We are seeing, and likely will continue to see, a systemic dismemberment of lawful immigration pathways to the United States. And the administration has shared a variety of reasons for that. Failure for refugees, for example, to assimilate into the United States. Security concerns and other matters.",
      "But if you just look at the numbers, immigrants today account for over 15 percent of the U.S. labor force. Millions of people in this country are immigrants. And if we look at the economic impact of removing that talent, removing those people from this country, there will certainly be an economic impact, as well as, I do believe, a technological and innovative impact as we look at the individuals coming here on student visas, on H-1B visas, and more. They are direct contributors to innovation in this country. And I fear that we risk losing out on that and getting the balance wrong between security, economic growth, and innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on that point, Chris, the administration says you can financially sort of arrange for more H-1B visas. These are the highly skilled workers. Are we losing a competitive edge because of the restrictions?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: I think this has been in play for several years, in fact. Going back even several administrations. What the Chinese, for instance, have figured out is that if they put their own capital into their Silicon Valley equivalent, they can retain high Chinese talent that has typically gone to the U.S. Gone to university in the U.S. and then stayed here because our venture capital space is booming. The Chinese have figured it out.",
      "And what we're seeing now, back to the risks piece, is that the Chinese are using their financial resources to pull highly advanced, highly capability engineers out of the U.S. and European workforce, bringing them back, and then copy much of the technology that's giving us the edge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there is a connection here, back to immigration policy changes, too?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, I want to ask you about another big event that's coming, the midterm races. We have seen a lot of political violence or concern about political violence in months past. The assassination of Charlie Kirk, the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. We saw Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania residence burnt. These are just some of the high-profile things. There's more that's happened. What do you anticipate? Should we be fearful of a political environment and elections?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Politically motivated violence is probably the threat that keeps me up the most at night, particularly as we look at the year ahead. Undoubtedly, the United States is viewed as one of the largest sources of conflict and homes of conflict in the world today, which is a seismic change if you think about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Heading into the midterms and, of course, looking ahead to the presidential, we have already seen terrorism becoming a tool of choice in the homeland to settle both personal grievances and political vendettas. The reasons for that are, of course, enhanced rhetoric, but also, frankly, enhanced access to like-minded individuals, enhanced access to tactics and techniques online. The ability to find out where your target is going to be and when, and more. The rhetoric needs to be calmed down.",
      "But there also needs to be the right investments in critical infrastructure protection, and in, appropriately, identifying foreign influence to try to stoke up political violence and other threats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there have been actual cutbacks in the things you just laid out as necessary tools in terms of the FBI, their task force on foreign influence operations.",
      "Chris, the agency you used to work for, CISA, it's seen, not just budget cuts, but just open jobs here.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is going on? Why not build up protection going into an environment like this?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: It's just not a priority right now for this administration. I think they believe that there were missteps in the past on with the Biden administration, and even the first Trump administration did on identifying, encountering information operations, particularly as they relate to elections.",
      "But we know that these threats are real. We know these risks are real. And we also know that they're multiplying. Sam talked earlier about the exponential explosion of capabilities in the hands of bad actors and the explosion of bad actors themselves because of tools like A.I.",
      "When I think about the '26 midterms, we are going to be two to three generations beyond what the current A.I. model capabilities are. So, they're only going to be more sophisticated, more advanced, more capabilities in the hands of those foreign and domestic that want to disrupt our ability to choose who represents us in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, both, for sharing your expertise with us.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Thank you.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's ahead in 2026? It's time to check in with some of our exhausted Washington beat reporters, including chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, who also hosts \"The Takeout,\" on our 24/7 digital network, chief Washington analyst Robert Costa, justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, and senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs.",
      "It's great to have you all here.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Exhausted but also energized. You know, we've got to keep the energy going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, keep the coffee coming, Major. We're going to need it for the year ahead.",
      "But we looked at the polling, Costa. I want to get your take on this. Because a majority of Americans disapprove of the president's signature policy issue, immigration. It came in at 54 percent. His approval of his handling of the economy, which is his other signature issue he was elected on, is now at 37 percent according to our latest CBS poll.",
      "Is the president frustrated with the perception of his first year?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Margaret, the Democrats are looking at those numbers, and that's why they're making their whole argument to the country of affordability. They see real vulnerability for this administration on the economy. But inside the White House, I would say the phrase is not affordability, it's self-confidence.",
      "This president, behind the scenes, is telling his advisers to stay steady, to not have alarm. There is frustration about press coverage. There's frustration about how Republicans in Congress seem to be so worried ahead of the midterm. Some headed for the exits with retirement.",
      "The president, again and again in private conversations with his top officials, is insistent that the trade policy is working. He's not going to pull off \u2013 pull back on tariffs at all. He believes he can have a new start with a new Fed chairman coming in in 2026. And so, it's President Trump at the center, driving this conversation and staving off any concern.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer, what do your sources tell you about how the president's going to tackle specifically some of these economic issues?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Housing costs are really eating into wages. And the president has been shown polling that showed this is a really hot issue for both Democratic voters and Republican voters alike. The president has about a dozen proposals before him that have all sorts of ideas of how to lower mortgage costs, decrease rental costs. They're thinking about creating a new savings account that would be similar to the 529 college savings account, but this would be for first-time home buyers. They're talking about federal lands, opening up federal lands for new housing construction. He has scheduled meetings down in Florida while he's there for Christmas break to talk to his advisers about this. I'm told that the president wants the housing cost issue to be the very first big policy decision that he launches in the new year, sometime January or February.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Focusing in on that biggest contributor to inflation, shelter costs.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, tariffs are at the very heart of the president's agenda. And we know the court is expected to decide soon on the legality on a certain set of the president's tariffs that he justified by citing fentanyl. Should the White Gouse be so confident that they're going to win?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I certainly didn't get that impression from the argument. I mean the chief justice, Justice Gorsuch, solid conservatives were asking questions, really skeptical of the administration's arguments on tariffs. It was kind of a tale of two arguments, though, because as that case kind of progressed, then they started asking questions skeptical of the other side.",
      "So, I mean, I think that anyone that comes out and like confidently predicts how the court's going to rule in this case is just wishful thinking. I mean it could be very close. I could see a 5-4 ruling, Trump losing. I could see a 6-3 decision, perhaps, Trump wins.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, on the legal front, the president has gone after some perceived enemies in things like executive orders, announced, you know, stripping away of security clearances, even of people who don't even currently have one, but he's made his point. But his attempt to prosecute opponents hasn't been quite as simple. What are you seeing?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: He campaigned a year ago arguing he'd end the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political enemies. And what did we see in 2025? An awful lot of investigations and criminal cases against his political critics. We saw these flailing attempts to charge James Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general. Those cases were dismissed. And twice in the past few weeks grand juries have said no to efforts to try to resuscitate the case against Letitia James. Grand juries rarely say no to prosecutors. That was a profound thing.",
      "And I think more fundamentally, Margaret, it's not just the cases or the investigations or the calls. It's the changes inside of the Department of Justice. They have purged out prosecutors who handled cases Trump doesn't like, bringing in potentially new voices that critics would say are poised to weaponize against critics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And a tacit administration from the White House chief of staff that there is a retribution campaign in the article written by \"Vanity Fair\" Chris Whipple. Susie Wiles said, yes, she was going to try to put a time limit on that, unsuccessfully, but acknowledging what Scott just said is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on this question, though, of limits to authority, Major, we've seen some limits to congressional power, or at least willingness to exert its authority. Do you think it's going to change this year?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The political contours of the Congress going into 2026 are going to really flow through how anxious are Republicans about their own ability to obtain re-election. And do they have to create some noticeable difference between themselves and the president and the Trump administration Through all 2025 the answer to that was, no, we're good, we're staying in with Trump. But if the atmosphere, which currently exists, leading to some retirements, continues to worsen, you will see more congressional pushback. Does it manifold in a way that stops Trump and the administration cold? No, but it complicates things. And if anyone leaves the cabinet, the idea of who the nominee is and what their Senate confirmation prospects are will be filtered through this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Costa, on that point, do you see departures from the cabinet happening?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's very possible, though President Trump is not one to just make a move immediately because there's a flurry of news, negative news, about one of his cabinet members. We see he often takes his time to make some of the decisions, and he doesn't like to be pressured to get rid of anybody.",
      "But there are so many people in the so-called MAGA universe who wants these slots. And they are able to get access to this president. A lot of these cabinet officials I've spoken to privately, and their top aides, say they're going to try to make it through the midterm elections and then leave. But if the president is feeling pressure to make some kind of significant change ahead of the midterms, I wouldn't rule anything out based on my reporting.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I can tell you, Margaret, this is not cabinet members, but this \u2013 in the West Wing, that main pack of inner circle advisers is going to stay intact. And that includes Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt, on the way down, that core group of people. They're not going anywhere. I think we will see some senior advisers in the West Wing leave. Just keep in mind that there are some advisers that have young children. So, they might be leaving for family reasons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, there is a perception that the Supreme Court has shown limited resistance to the president's efforts to expand the powers of the executive. Do you think that's fair? And do you think on that big case that's coming with birthright citizenship, that they will find in his favor?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think there is the perception because of the way the court has handled some of these emergency requests from the Trump administration to step in to these cases and put lower court rulings on hold while the litigation plays out. So, that would let the policies take effect. And the Trump administration has had tremendous success, I mean well over 20 such requests have been granted to let some of these policies go into effect, whether it's on deportations, on immigration stops, mass firings. But those are temporary, interim orders. And the administration has been very strategic and only appealing these adverse rulings from courts below that it thinks it can win. Again, these are just interim orders. Once we do get to the merits, I don't think Trump's going to win all these cases. And I certainly don't think he's going to win the birthright citizenship case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: No, absolutely not. He may not win the tariff's case. Right now it's looking great for Trump in the Supreme Court, but it may look very different come June when we have kind of gotten through some of these big, landmark rulings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Jan's beat is going to be at the center of the 2026 politics, tariffs, Voting Rights Act, and birthright citizenship. All will have massive, political consequences.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, and so many social issue cases as well. Transgender participation in girl's sports. We've got two huge gun rights cases. This is a highly consequential term for the court.",
      "And, you know, it's going to be in conflict, I think, with President Trump by the end of the term because he's not going to like all these rulings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with more from our panel.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with our panel.",
      "Predictions for 2026.",
      "Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: My motto as a reporter is assume nothing. And we're very early in the 2028 presidential cycle and discussion. Governor Newsom of California, Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Pritzker of Illinois, the list goes on. But my prediction is, in 2026, we're going to see some names we're not discussing at all start to emerge as possible contenders for the Democrats in 2028. Some celebrities might come into the mix. And one name I would venture, based on some recent reporting, Stephen A. Smith, the sports personality, is talking to people in the Democratic Party about whether he has a future. Whether he runs or not, TBD. But something to watch, celebrity politics in the age of Trump on both sides.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan Crawford.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm going to revisit a prediction I made last year when I kind of confidently said that Justice Alito was probably going to retire and give President Trump his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court. Sources close to Justice Alito say he has not made up his mind. He, in many ways, is too young to retire. He's 75 years old. But then there's the concern that he's too old not too, because if he cares about his legacy, and he is that intellectual leader of the conservative wing, if he cares about his legacy with a Republican in the White House or a Republican- controlled Senate, this year would be the best time for him to retire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think Americans will begin or increasingly feel the effects of DOGE. There's an awful lot of people that lost their jobs in the last 12 months. A lot of long-time career civil servants who were good at delivering products for the American citizens. In my world, the Department of Justice, there have been 5,000 people. That can't help but slow down prosecutions, investigations, and doing right by American people. And that's true across the board in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Fraud investigations. I think you're going to see this administration really dig in deeper to try to find evidence that proves fraud in various government programs. People cheating the system, trying to fleece taxpayers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, I'm going to be the glue for this process because we have predictions and underreported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We get \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mine merge together.",
      "So, prediction is, data centers and A.I. expansion will be an underappreciated but potent political issue in 2026. Eight executive ordered signed by President Trump related to artificial intelligence just behind tariffs and immigration. He has made himself the A.I. president. Yet, let me give you some names of state, Indiana, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, all in one way or another, on the Republican side, are up in arms about either A.I. regulation, lack thereof, or data centers and their implications. Sixty percent in our most recent poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans believe artificial intelligence will not increase jobs but take jobs away. And 44 percent in our most recent poll want more regulation of A.I. than less. This is a wedge issue that Democrats have identified because it is not cohered on the MAGA side. The president has already put down his chips on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Underreported . What did you want to report that you couldn't?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I love, to Scott's point, I'm going to build on it Elon Musk and the DOGE team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: They promised to cut the federal workforce. We're at the end of the year. So, what is the tally for the year? It is 271,000 workers. That's according to the latest jobs report that showed how many workers the federal government shed. So, just to put that into perspective, that's roughly the population of Madison, Wisconsin. So, imagine if every single person in Madison, Wisconsin, were to lose their job, either ousted or they leave their job.",
      "So, the bottom line on DOGE is that they did not succeed in cutting overall government spending, but they did fulfill their mission to trim the federal headcount by roughly about 10 percent. And I think it's going to be important to track those workers and to see where they end up, what their fates are, because they are not being scooped up in the private sector, at least not yet.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There was some attention, but not the requisite attention to the thermonuclear use of pardons in 2025. Blanket pardons, family pardons, preemptive pardons. Is the next person going to bring it back to what we've enjoyed over the past couple centuries, the traditional controversies around pardons?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, under reported?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, there is a narrative that the Supreme Court is corrupt. I mean we saw that emerge in the wake of the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe versus Wade. And now we see it, that they're in the tank for Trump. Not only is that narrative overreported, it is patently false, and it is dangerous for the institution and the public's faith and confidence in the rule of law. This is a conservative Supreme Court. It has been a conservative Supreme Court for 20 years. People can disagree and do disagree with their opinions, but it's profoundly wrong to call it \u2013 or say corruption where there, in fact, is none.",
      "What's underreported is any understanding of what this court's been doing for the past 20 years. Its views of its role, vis-a-vis the other branches. How it sees the law. How it's trying, in its focus, to restore some kind of accountability and our constitutional structure.",
      "Again, this is a court that is functional. It is consistent. They are nine justices. They don't necessarily see the Constitution the same way by any means or how to interpret federal law. There's a struggle over the proper way to interpret the Constitution. But that is as it should be. And I think as we approach our 250th anniversary of this country, it's important to think about the court and their rule of law as the justices are doing, especially if we hope to keep democracy intact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big statement, Jan, if we hope to keep democracy intact. My goodness.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: If we lost \u2013 if the public loses confidence in the rule of law, I don't know what that means for democracy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And that's why I think some of the rhetoric about corruption is so, so profoundly irresponsible.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it causes threats.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, yes. Which, again, I mean the justices are under tremendous, and federal judges as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's all institutions, including for (ph) the state.",
      "Bob Costa, your underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Just briefly. One of the most striking stories of the year politically, Zohran Mamdani. Young \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, no. Let me \u2013 let me make my point. One of the most striking stories was Mamdani's victory. The big question a lot of people have is, well, how does this happen? How does this young, Democratic socialist win in New York City? In my view, the most underreported story of the year is how someone laid the foundation for Zohran Mamdani. Someone near 50 years older, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent, Democratic socialist of Vermont, had what's called a \"Fight Oligarchy Tour\" earlier in 2025, drawing thousands of people in red states and blue states. Sanders enabled Mamdani, and others like him, to start to gain traction for Democratic socialism inside of the Democratic construct in this country in 2025.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.",
      "BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.",
      "BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--",
      "MOYNIHAN\u00a0 \u00a0Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?",
      "MOYNIHAN \u00a0 Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --and medium size businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.",
      "MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.",
      "BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--",
      "MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.",
      "BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.",
      "BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.",
      "BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.",
      "BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--",
      "BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--",
      "BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.",
      "BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.",
      "MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.",
      "BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.",
      "BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --even\u2013",
      "BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --20 years ago--",
      "BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--",
      "BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?",
      "MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--",
      "BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.",
      "MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Happy Holidays, thank you.",
      "BRENNAN: Happy Holidays to you.",

    "story": [
      "Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that, as President Trump searches for a new chair of the Federal Reserve, maintaining the banking system's independence is paramount.",
      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

    "summary": "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled.",
    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-for-release-epstein-files-naming-democrats/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:59:08 -0500",
    "summary": "As prosecutors contend with a massive trove of Epstein files, President Trump suggested Friday the Justice Department is spending too much time on the issue \u2014 but said Democrats should be named.",
    "story": [
      "As prosecutors contend with a massive trove of documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, President Trump suggested Friday the Justice Department is spending too much time on the issue \u2014 but said prominent Democrats linked to Epstein should be named.",
      "The Justice Department has released scores of records on Epstein over the last week, responding to a law requiring it to publish its files on Epstein by Dec. 19. The files cover more than 20 years worth of investigations into the disgraced financier, and highlighted the relationships he cultivated over the years with well-known people like Mr. Trump and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 neither of whom have been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "And on Wednesday, the department announced that the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan had discovered upwards of 1 million more records \"potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.\" It said that combing through the newly discovered documents and making necessary redactions could take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the discovery on Truth Social late Friday, writing: \"Now 1,000,000 more pages on Epstein are found. DOJ is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax. When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.\"",
      "The president went on to allege that Democrats, not Republicans, are \"the ones who worked with Epstein.\"",
      "\"Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been wary of the Epstein issue, periodically calling it a \"hoax\" and arguing that Republican lawmakers who supported the release of more records on Epstein had fallen for a diversion tactic spearheaded by Democrats.",
      "He eventually said last month that Republicans should vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated the files' release, writing, \"it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.\"",
      "Simultaneously, the president has zeroed in on Democrats with links to Epstein. In mid-November, he asked the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's ties to Clinton and two other Democrats. The department had previously said in July that there is no evidence to justify prosecuting any uncharged third-parties in the Epstein case.",
      "Last week's initial release of Justice Department files on Epstein featured multiple photos of Clinton, including an image of the former president sitting in a hot tub and several images of him at events with celebrities like Michael Jackson.",
      "Another release of files earlier this week included references to Mr. Trump. One 2020 email from a federal prosecutor said flight logs revealed that the president flew on Epstein's private jet \"many more times\" than was previously known.",
      "The files do not indicate wrongdoing on the part of Clinton or Mr. Trump. A Clinton spokesperson has long acknowledged that the former president traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes.",
      "A Clinton spokesperson\u00a0on Monday\u00a0pushed the Justice Department to release \"any remaining records\" in the Epstein files that mention Clinton or include a photo of him, arguing the former president has nothing to hide.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but says he cut off ties with Epstein many years ago. The president called the release of photos of Clinton and others a \"terrible thing\" on Monday, saying that many people who appear in images with Epstein \"really had nothing to do with\" him.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters. \"I think Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it. But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago ... and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:55:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families that was modified in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "The Veterans Affairs Department is reimposing a near total ban on abortions for veterans and their families after a Justice Department memo from the Office of Legal Counsel last week\u00a0asserted that it's against federal law for the VA to provide them in most instances.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice's opinion states that VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions, and VA is complying with it immediately. DOJ's opinion is consistent with VA's proposed rule, which continues to work its way through the regulatory process.\"",
      "In 2022, the department modified its 1999 abortion rules\u00a0to allow \"access to abortions when the life or health of the pregnant Veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest,\"\u00a0the VA website states.",
      "Now, under the guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel, the VA's proposed rule reinstates \"the full exclusion on abortions and abortion counseling from the medical benefits package.\"",
      "The proposed rule does have one exception, stating that the \"VA has never understood this policy to prohibit providing care to pregnant women in life-threatening circumstances, including treatment for ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, which were covered under the VA's medical benefits package prior to the 2022. ... For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed rule would make clear that the exclusion for abortion does not apply 'when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington condemned the VA's move in a post on X, saying it \"is yet another attack on reproductive freedom and a profound betrayal of veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.\" And Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, said on X that denying veterans \"the freedom to make their own health care decisions\u2014especially survivors of military sexual trauma\u2014is cruel, dangerous, and an insult to all who have served.\"",
      "The VA argued in its proposed rule that it is \"without question that VA has the authority to bar provision of abortion services through the VA medical benefits package to veterans\" and says the Biden administration implemented the changes to the abortion ban in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning women's abortion rights. \"In doing so, the administration predicted a high demand for VA abortions that never materialized,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a press release that the policy \"is effectively a national abortion ban for veterans, preventing them and their families from receiving abortions at VA health care facilities in all 50 states, including the 14 states that protect abortion rights.\"",
      "The VA's policy change was first reported by MS Now.",

      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",

    "summary": "China dominates the supply of critical minerals such as tungsten, but a U.S. push for alternative sources has found one, deep inside a South Korean mountain.",
    "story": [
      "Sangdong mine, South Korea \u2014 Over the course of decades, China has come to dominate the rare earths and critical minerals industries, virtually cornering the market on raw materials that are essential to every aspect of modern life, from cellphones to armor piercing ammunition and AI missile guidance systems.",
      "Beijing's stranglehold on the production of these valuable metals and minerals has driven a hasty search by U.S. authorities to secure alternative supply options.",
      "Lewis Black says his company is ready to help fill the void, at least when it comes to the supply of tungsten, a mineral he calls \"vital\" to U.S. defense needs.",
      "Black, CEO of the Canadian mining company Almonty Industries, flew from New York to South Korea last week to give CBS News a tour of the mine he hopes will soon be producing enough tungsten to meet at least the most urgent of America's needs.",
      "In the days before his flight to the Sangdong mine, Black met with U.S. officials, including at the White House, and he signed a deal guaranteeing that Almonty will, in the future, supply enough tungsten for U.S. security needs.",
      "Black said he couldn't discuss the details of the agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Tungsten's superpower",
      "The power of tungsten is rooted in the fact that it has the highest melting point of any element. While used in everyday items from electrical wiring to semiconductors and batteries, its applications in the defense industry make it truly indispensable.",
      "\"It's vital. It's further than critical, it's vital,\" Black told CBS News, standing in an enormous red building covered in corrugated steel sheeting that houses his processing plant in Sangdong.",
      "As he spoke, machinery that breaks down the ore \u2014 the rocks embedded with tungsten \u2014 ground in a slow circular motion, undergoing tests in preparation for being fully commissioned later this year.",
      "\"It's not just in the things you can see like munitions and armor,\" Black said. \"You want to build armored vehicles? All the engineering, all the AI chips, AI chips you can't build without tungsten gas. You want to build a plane? The rockets, it's in everything. It's a vital component, a small one, but without it, you can't do it.\"",
      "The Sangdong tungsten mine's rise, fall and renaissance",
      "Tungsten was first discovered in a rocky outcrop at the Sangdong site, about 115 miles southeast of Seoul, in 1906. A Japanese company started mining there about a decade later, and the tungsten extracted was later used for Japan's war machine during the Second World War.",
      "The end of that war brought an end to Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and the Sangdong mine returned to Korean control. It would go on to have a profound effect on South Korea's economy, at one point accounting for 30% of the nation's GDP.",
      "South Korean presidents visited the mine at least six times \u2014 it was a source of national pride. But in the 1990s, it fell victim to China's price dumping policies and was mothballed.",
      "For the ensuing three decades, the U.S., along with many other Western nations, benefited from the cheap, government subsidized materials being produced by China.",
      "But that benefit became a reliance, and it left Washington exposed and vulnerable amid a tense trade war with China that's seen Beijing impose export restrictions on some rare earths and other critical materials.",
      "In response, there's been a rush to establish alternative supply chains.",
      "China controls at least 80% of the world's current tungsten supplies, according to Almonty, with Russia and North Korea both holding a smaller but significant share of the assets.",
      "Almonty Industries is in the process of relocating its headquarters to New York. It's a clear indication that the U.S. government has become a very important part of Black's business \u2014 his biggest customer, in fact.",
      "Almonty took ownership of the Sandong mine in 2015.",
      "Catching up with China is \"going to be disruptive\"",
      "Almonty also has tungsten mines in Spain and Portugal, and it recently purchased one in Montana, specifically in the interest, Black said, of U.S. national security.",
      "\"With the U.S. government, that's one of the reasons why we've taken a mine in the U.S. \u2014 bringing our technology to the country so that we can start to generate more human capital for the long term,\" he said. \"To me it feels good for the legacy of the company to fill a gap that has been left hugely exposed.\"",
      "Black said the mine in Montana won't be operational for years, however, as Almonty still needs to secure permits and train personnel. It's all analogous, he notes, to the overarching problem the U.S. and its Western partners have as they seek to untangle themselves from supply chain reliance on China; it's going to take a long time.",
      "\"China dominates so many different sectors, whether it be rare earths, lithium, graphite, tin, lead, aluminum,\" Black said, adding that over the last eight decades many such industries simply \"fell out of favor in the West, and we abandoned raw materials.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "More than 51 million Americans live in areas under winter storm alerts stretching from northern Minnesota to the Eastern Seaboard.",
    "story": [
      "More than 3,000 flights were canceled or delayed across the United States on Sunday after a\u00a0winter storm packing ice and snow\u00a0slammed the Midwest and Great Lakes regions during the busy travel period between Christmas and New Year's.",
      "A system that was sweeping across the Great Lakes and Great Plains regions on Sunday went through rapid intensification and became a so-called \"bomb cyclone,\" or explosive cyclogenesis, which occurs when cold air and warm air collide. The clashing of arctic air and record-high temperatures in the south causes air pressure to drop sharply, leading to powerful winds, heavy rain or snow and dangerous weather like blizzards.",
      "There were approximately 20 million Americans under wind alerts on Sunday morning \u2014 by the late afternoon, the number rose to more than 50 million.",
      "On Saturday, another storm system dumped 4.3 inches of snow in New York City's Central Park. It was less than what forecasts had predicted, but amounted to the first New York City snowfall greater than four inches since January of 2022,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News New York meteorologist Matthew DeLucia.",
      "At least 4,400 flights have been canceled across the U.S. since Friday, and thousands more were delayed, according to the flight-tracking website\u00a0FlightAware.",
      "The National Weather Service warned of hazardous travel conditions from the Great Lakes through the northern mid-Atlantic and southern New England, with the potential for tree damage and power outages. The storm had weakened by Sunday, but forecasters said a plunge of frigid arctic air moving southward into the Great Plains would bring more heavy snow, blizzards and widespread blustery conditions to huge swaths of the country.",
      "Map shows winter storm warnings",
      "On Sunday, More than 38.7 million people were under a winter weather advisory, while 9.6 million others were under a winter storm warning or winter storm watch. Another 2.7 million were under a blizzard warning.",
      "The alerts came as arctic air surges into the Great Plains region, setting the stage for a rapidly intensifying winter storm, CBS Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak said. The snow was forecast to expand over the upper Midwest later in the day, ultimately leading to heavy snowfall accompanied by powerful winds in the evening.",
      "Winter storm advisories and warnings\u00a0are in place through Monday in parts of Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York, where a forthcoming winter storm warning is set to take effect Monday in Buffalo and remain active through Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Additional winter weather advisories are in place for parts of Massachusetts, including Boston and surrounding areas; upstate New York, including Albany; Illinois, Iowa and the Dakotas.",
      "States stretching from Texas all the way up through Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Western New York could all see wind gusts over 60 mph. Several tornado warnings were issued in central Illinois on Sunday, with search and rescue operations underway in Mt. Zion, Illinois, after reported damage from a suspected tornado.",
      "Map shows forecast for ice conditions",
      "Ice is the biggest concern for areas across the Northeast, which are forecast to see a wave of freezing rain develop on Sunday ahead of the same weather system currently impacting the middle of the country. Icy conditions will likely spread through interior areas of New England by Sunday night, Kozak said, adding that the region is expected to receive a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain overnight into Monday morning.",
      "CBS Philadelphia urged local residents to be aware of potentially slick roads and sidewalks after the region saw a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. Temperatures are expected to be above freezing during the day on Sunday and continue to warm into Monday, but forecasters warned that the reprieve would be brief ahead of the approaching cold front that will likely linger through the end of the week.",
      "More snow and cold in the forecast",
      "Forecasters predict more snow is on its way for much of the northern part of the country.",
      "Americans from the upper Midwest to the Great Lakes are bracing for blizzard conditions, which are expected to set in Sunday night and continue into Monday. In the upper Great Lakes, people could see more than a foot of snow \u2014 and, potentially, as much as two feet \u2014 accumulate, especially along the south shore of Lake Superior, according to Kozak. Near-whiteout conditions are also forecast in that area south of the lake.",
      "In the Northeast, where snow wrapped up across central and southern New England on Saturday with 4 to 8 inches in some spots, colder-than-normal temperatures are expected for the rest of the weekend. But the National Weather Service noted that parts of the region would likely see a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain by Monday.",
      "In the interior parts of the Northeast, 6-10 inches of snow was expected through Monday in certain places.",
      "After that, cool air moving in throughout the week behind the cold front will allow for lake effect snowfall to pile up, with 1-2 feet possible in some areas.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation, as 2025 comes to an end, we will look ahead to 2026 and what's on the horizon for the economy, national security, and more.",
      "2025 is almost behind us. It's been a year filled with change that's turned Washington norms upside down and a year filled with news of great tragedy, but also moments of true triumph. What's ahead for Americans in 2026 when it comes to the economy?",
      "We will turn to Wall Street and the chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, for the industry's economic forecast. We will look at national security threats and challenges from the increasing use of artificial intelligence with CBS News contributors Samantha Vinograd and Chris Krebs.",
      "And we will wrap up and look to the new year with our CBS News Washington correspondents in our annual roundtable.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin again with the top issue this year for Americans, the economy.",
      "Earlier this month, we spoke with the head of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, about the state of the economy as we head in to 2026.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling is showing that the \u2013 most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story when you look at the upper- income brackets.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you see data of actual transactions.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We not only see it in the aggregate. We also see it in pieces.",
      "And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend on Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's \u2013 it's up 4, 4.25, 4.5 percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing.",
      "And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending at a little faster growth rate, but still growing, and in the middle and upper faster.",
      "So, you know, what they're telling you is what they feel. What they're actually seeing, is spending is reasonably solid \u2013 reasonably solid heading into the end of the year. And it's been kind of going along like that all of December.",
      "Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are \u2013 you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending. They have good credit quality. They are employed. And we can see wages growing in \u2013 as people's paychecks come in at a 3 percent clip. So it's a \u2013 it's pretty solid right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper-income brackets? Is it that K-shaped economy some people talk about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, our team puts the \u2013 looks at this.",
      "Yes, it \u2013 the growth rate difference is higher, but all of \u2013 all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and that's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low, but spending that's higher?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's \u2013 you hear about it. You've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that \u2013 because we had a very \u2013 a very strange process from '20 through to now.",
      "We had COVID lockdown. Then we had all the stimulus. Then we had high inflation. And then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's \u2013 they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times.",
      "And so they saw the inflation in '20 \u2013 in, yes, '20 and '23 and '24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist. And it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into '26, having come through '25, the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at it, they think inflation keeps working its way down.",
      "But it's \u2013 it's what people feel. And you can't discount that. And it's also, at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on.",
      "But \u2013 but it's \u2013 it's not widespread. At 4 \u2013 you know, 4.6 percent unemployment is the last number they published. That's still in the \u2013 in - - our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so, in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a big concern. But Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de-escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think, if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was shock. There was shock on liberation day.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There was shock, the size, sheer size, at the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera.",
      "What you have seen now, as time has moved on, it's sort of a 15 percent on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the U.S. or won't commit to lowering their non-tariff barriers and things like that.",
      "And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean or foreign CEOs, you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be \u2013 drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15 percent.",
      "To go from a 10 percent across the board to 15 percent, for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to \u2013 it's starting to de-escalate, in that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15 percent here, 17 \u2013 different numbers.",
      "When you put China, China's a different question, because of the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just A.I., all that stuff. It's a very different case.",
      "And I think also, between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly, in the world, you can see sort of the end point here, and now they've just got to \u2013 it's got to work through the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B-of-A is the largest small business lender.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender.",
      "And as you're \u2013 if we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very \u2013 because rates had gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow at floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them, I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit?",
      "But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit. So they're more \u2013 their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do \u2013 to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern.",
      "It's not that they agree with them or are disagree with them. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So, if you think across four policy regimes, tax, trade, tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation, you have seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability.",
      "How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable, they're here, so give me a set of rules and I will go play with them. But I need to be clarified of what the rules are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it.",
      "One is, the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So, if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that's slowing down that activity.",
      "The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country, some single-family \u2013 you could have single-family, multi \u2013 small multifloor units, things like that, or even more, bigger multifamily in major cities. But there's a universal housing shortage, because, for so many years, it's been hard to get housing permitted.",
      "And so the advice I give to anybody is, you're probably not going to see the 10-year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of 3, and but the 10-year rate stays between 4 and 4.5, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than it is today.",
      "But if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that. It's probably the solution.",
      "Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people with 3 percent mortgage rates, that's not going to be a change. And, by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low a rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession.",
      "So we shouldn't be cheering for 3 percent mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down as a good thing.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Because there's 60 million \u2013 there's 130-odd million households in America. Half of them don't have a mortgage. This is \u2013 this whole lock-in question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: \u2026 is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring \u2013 rental affordability is a question, or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that.",
      "So it's a very complex thing. But simplistic \u2013 simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie.",
      "Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The treasury secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake.",
      "Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But \u2013 but, for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, I don't talk about client relationships.",
      "But, look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And \u2013 and the administration knows that and Secretary Bessent knows it. That guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30-year mortgage, because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee, for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels there are more advantageous to borrow.",
      "You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be OK, or a lot of years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that guarantee is critical to the U.S. getting fixed- rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability.",
      "And then they've run the things pretty responsible since the financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason \u2013 one of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them.",
      "And as soon as rate \u2013 prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful of all that. And I think the \u2013 but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been.",
      "They're a great company. They're an iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May.",
      "How much does that job matter to the consumer? How do you explain that?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things.",
      "So the president's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's \u2013 he should do it.",
      "There's \u2013 in my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not \u2013 we're a country \u2013 we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer \u2013 all these people drive our economy.",
      "The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get \u2013 since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You pushed back pretty hard in that moment.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six-page report.",
      "There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been \u2013 have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on.",
      "So, if you read the Web site, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was, that's not what was going \u2013 never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clearer, so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others.",
      "And we'll \u2013 we'll look at anybody who feels we \u2013 believe me, they \u2013 people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, you closed my account. Why? And we can tell them.",
      "But I think people are forgetting, the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And they \u2013 and, believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be \u2013 fail as a company, and, therefore, we're going to write you up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration, that kind of social pressure, you're saying?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty years ago. OK.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up.",
      "And the second thing is that \u2013 that, for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at $10,000. And you have two things. If it goes above that, you have to report on it and if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972.",
      "That number would be $80,000 today. So what we thought was material then\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and so there's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to \u2013 if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful.",
      "So there's sort of the ESG side of it. Those things, I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff, because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter, and then the reputation risk, which, to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this issue, the president himself really dug into. And he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, is \u2013 do you know what he's talking about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We \u2013 I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we banked everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it on television about you.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I know that. I know that. People \u2013 if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television, it \u2013 I would be rich. So, in the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers.",
      "We have tens of thousands \u2013 we are the biggest small business lender in the country, period, end, stop. You know, and so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's \u2013 it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their \u2013 and their points of view.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look ahead to the top national security threats in 2026, we're joined now by two CBS contributors.",
      "Chris Krebs was director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the first Trump administration, and Sam Vinograd, a former counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security during the Biden administration.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Good to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have heard so much in the past year about A.I., artificial intelligence, in virtually every sector of the business world and national security.",
      "You have said A.I., it's not just an app on your phone. It's not just a computer chip. It's energy. It's data centers. There are some really complex challenging \u2013 challenges here. What are you looking at in the year ahead?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, starting exactly there, just the diversity of sectors that are impacted by A.I., it is an incredibly complex global value chain.",
      "It's chips. We have heard a lot about the Nvidia H200 chips and then competing against Huawei in China. It is software.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying not to sell them to China and the debate over\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Right. Right. And there's a significant tension in the national security space on, should we give China chips or should we deprive them of chips?",
      "And it seems for now that the side that wants to give China chips and then extract value and revenue from it, that team has won for now. But, broader than that, there's software. There's infrastructure. There's data centers. There's water. There's thermal management. There is training. There's work force.",
      "So it is not just about the app that manifests on your phone. It's the entirety of the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's reshaping so many sectors of the economy.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It's reshaping the way virtually every business operates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: If you go talk to CEOs, they're talking about how they can be an A.I.-first company. Are they happy with the results that they're seeing right now? Absolutely not. But they know, two years, we're going to face this equivalent of a Cambrian explosion of A.I. capabilities across the economy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And, Margaret, if I can just add, it's not just reshaping how businesses operate. It's also reshaping how governments operate.",
      "If you look at A.I., nothing is zero sum in national security. It's not a net positive or a net negative. A.I., and I have seen this firsthand, is changing the way that investigations are performed. It allows law enforcement officials to comb through so much data and to do investigations more efficiently.",
      "It is allowing the U.S. military to use certain autonomous vehicles and weapons that can reduce civilian risk, if managed appropriately, and more effectively engage in war fighting. It's changing the way the intelligence community is able to both collect and review data.",
      "At the same time, it is opening up a whole new host of threats. A.I. doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors. It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said something that was a little frightening to me. You said, as technology gets more advanced, the ability to anonymously hurt people exponentially increases.",
      "What does that mean on the homeland security front?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: A.I. gives actors, not just in the homeland, but literally all around the world, to very credibly pretend to be somebody else. It is upending the whole notion of what identity is in today's day and age.",
      "A.I. is allowing bad actors to very authentically and credibly pretend to be someone else, both with their voices, with their faces, and then to deliver threats in a way that actually resonates. So it's impersonating someone, but then also using A.I. to figure out where vulnerabilities are in a system and what a target audience or a target entity is going to respond to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want both of you to weigh in on this, but, Chris, we heard just last month the first documented case of a fully automated cyberattack by a foreign government. This was the A.I. chatbot Claude.",
      "They said the suspected Chinese hackers had used their A.I. to breach about 30 global organizations, just to do it really quickly and efficiently, as I understand it. So whose job is it to protect against it? Is it the government's job or is it a private corporation to figure out how to protect against all these risks you laid out?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think there are two things in play right now.",
      "One is, what's the regulatory environment look like that requires the safe use of these platforms? And we have seen a pullback on the regulatory front from this administration. The Biden administration had an A.I. executive order that required certain notifications and safety testings. That's been pulled back.",
      "Instead, we're in this innovation-first model. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was light touch. This is even \u2013 this is no touch, you're saying.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: This is \u2013 yes, I \u2013 again, this is really putting the full weight of the government behind the U.S. technology industry winning the global A.I. race. That is the top priority.",
      "And so what's happening in the meantime is, you would normally say, OK, the states are going to regulate, but now you have the White House weighing in saying states cannot regulate in the A.I. space. And, again, CEOs want some guidance. They want governance. So they have to do it themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, switching gears for a moment here, we're looking at 2026, a huge number of mass gatherings in the United States. You have got FIFA, World Cup, the Super Bowl, the nation's 250th anniversary. Are you concerned about homeland security in the new year?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: There are always a lot of threats facing the homeland. What is materially different in the coming year, in 2026, is that there are structural issues that I fear make us more vulnerable to successful attack.",
      "That includes the fact that the United States probably for the first time in our history is no longer viewed globally as the leader and poster child for rules-based international order. Other actors feel like they don't have to follow the rules if we're not going to. That could introduce new threats.",
      "At the same time, there has been a degradation in the systems of government that do identify threats and then work to prevent them, not just today, but over the medium and longer term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break here, come back on the other side of it. More \u2013 more things to worry about in the new year in just a minute.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half-hour, more of our conversation on national security, plus our annual CBS News correspondents roundtable.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Samantha Vinograd and Chris Krebs. Both are CBS contributors.",
      "Sam, you worked in Homeland Security under the Biden administration. And we heard at that time that the administration was just hamstrung unless Congress did something on the immigration front. This administration took a completely different approach. I mean let's just look at what they did this year. Mass deportation campaign. Significant change to legal immigration. Border crossings are now at the lowest level in decades. Secured major funding for ICE and CBP. Half a million arrests conducted. They repealed protected status for many immigrants. And now there's a travel ban or restrictions on about 39 countries total.",
      "What is the longer-term impact of these kind of really massive changes?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be clear, the Biden administration did take action in July of 2024 to try to curtail unlawful immigration. December 2023 we saw almost 250,000 individuals unlawfully crossing our border. By January of 2025, that was down about 85 percent before Biden took office \u2013 left office as a result of his executive order.",
      "We are seeing, and likely will continue to see, a systemic dismemberment of lawful immigration pathways to the United States. And the administration has shared a variety of reasons for that. Failure for refugees, for example, to assimilate into the United States. Security concerns and other matters.",
      "But if you just look at the numbers, immigrants today account for over 15 percent of the U.S. labor force. Millions of people in this country are immigrants. And if we look at the economic impact of removing that talent, removing those people from this country, there will certainly be an economic impact, as well as, I do believe, a technological and innovative impact as we look at the individuals coming here on student visas, on H-1B visas, and more. They are direct contributors to innovation in this country. And I fear that we risk losing out on that and getting the balance wrong between security, economic growth, and innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on that point, Chris, the administration says you can financially sort of arrange for more H-1B visas. These are the highly skilled workers. Are we losing a competitive edge because of the restrictions?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: I think this has been in play for several years, in fact. Going back even several administrations. What the Chinese, for instance, have figured out is that if they put their own capital into their Silicon Valley equivalent, they can retain high Chinese talent that has typically gone to the U.S. Gone to university in the U.S. and then stayed here because our venture capital space is booming. The Chinese have figured it out.",
      "And what we're seeing now, back to the risks piece, is that the Chinese are using their financial resources to pull highly advanced, highly capability engineers out of the U.S. and European workforce, bringing them back, and then copy much of the technology that's giving us the edge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there is a connection here, back to immigration policy changes, too?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, I want to ask you about another big event that's coming, the midterm races. We have seen a lot of political violence or concern about political violence in months past. The assassination of Charlie Kirk, the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. We saw Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania residence burnt. These are just some of the high-profile things. There's more that's happened. What do you anticipate? Should we be fearful of a political environment and elections?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Politically motivated violence is probably the threat that keeps me up the most at night, particularly as we look at the year ahead. Undoubtedly, the United States is viewed as one of the largest sources of conflict and homes of conflict in the world today, which is a seismic change if you think about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Heading into the midterms and, of course, looking ahead to the presidential, we have already seen terrorism becoming a tool of choice in the homeland to settle both personal grievances and political vendettas. The reasons for that are, of course, enhanced rhetoric, but also, frankly, enhanced access to like-minded individuals, enhanced access to tactics and techniques online. The ability to find out where your target is going to be and when, and more. The rhetoric needs to be calmed down.",
      "But there also needs to be the right investments in critical infrastructure protection, and in, appropriately, identifying foreign influence to try to stoke up political violence and other threats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there have been actual cutbacks in the things you just laid out as necessary tools in terms of the FBI, their task force on foreign influence operations.",
      "Chris, the agency you used to work for, CISA, it's seen, not just budget cuts, but just open jobs here.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is going on? Why not build up protection going into an environment like this?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: It's just not a priority right now for this administration. I think they believe that there were missteps in the past on with the Biden administration, and even the first Trump administration did on identifying, encountering information operations, particularly as they relate to elections.",
      "But we know that these threats are real. We know these risks are real. And we also know that they're multiplying. Sam talked earlier about the exponential explosion of capabilities in the hands of bad actors and the explosion of bad actors themselves because of tools like A.I.",
      "When I think about the '26 midterms, we are going to be two to three generations beyond what the current A.I. model capabilities are. So, they're only going to be more sophisticated, more advanced, more capabilities in the hands of those foreign and domestic that want to disrupt our ability to choose who represents us in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, both, for sharing your expertise with us.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Thank you.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's ahead in 2026? It's time to check in with some of our exhausted Washington beat reporters, including chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, who also hosts \"The Takeout,\" on our 24/7 digital network, chief Washington analyst Robert Costa, justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, and senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs.",
      "It's great to have you all here.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Exhausted but also energized. You know, we've got to keep the energy going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, keep the coffee coming, Major. We're going to need it for the year ahead.",
      "But we looked at the polling, Costa. I want to get your take on this. Because a majority of Americans disapprove of the president's signature policy issue, immigration. It came in at 54 percent. His approval of his handling of the economy, which is his other signature issue he was elected on, is now at 37 percent according to our latest CBS poll.",
      "Is the president frustrated with the perception of his first year?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Margaret, the Democrats are looking at those numbers, and that's why they're making their whole argument to the country of affordability. They see real vulnerability for this administration on the economy. But inside the White House, I would say the phrase is not affordability, it's self-confidence.",
      "This president, behind the scenes, is telling his advisers to stay steady, to not have alarm. There is frustration about press coverage. There's frustration about how Republicans in Congress seem to be so worried ahead of the midterm. Some headed for the exits with retirement.",
      "The president, again and again in private conversations with his top officials, is insistent that the trade policy is working. He's not going to pull off \u2013 pull back on tariffs at all. He believes he can have a new start with a new Fed chairman coming in in 2026. And so, it's President Trump at the center, driving this conversation and staving off any concern.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer, what do your sources tell you about how the president's going to tackle specifically some of these economic issues?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Housing costs are really eating into wages. And the president has been shown polling that showed this is a really hot issue for both Democratic voters and Republican voters alike. The president has about a dozen proposals before him that have all sorts of ideas of how to lower mortgage costs, decrease rental costs. They're thinking about creating a new savings account that would be similar to the 529 college savings account, but this would be for first-time home buyers. They're talking about federal lands, opening up federal lands for new housing construction. He has scheduled meetings down in Florida while he's there for Christmas break to talk to his advisers about this. I'm told that the president wants the housing cost issue to be the very first big policy decision that he launches in the new year, sometime January or February.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Focusing in on that biggest contributor to inflation, shelter costs.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, tariffs are at the very heart of the president's agenda. And we know the court is expected to decide soon on the legality on a certain set of the president's tariffs that he justified by citing fentanyl. Should the White Gouse be so confident that they're going to win?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I certainly didn't get that impression from the argument. I mean the chief justice, Justice Gorsuch, solid conservatives were asking questions, really skeptical of the administration's arguments on tariffs. It was kind of a tale of two arguments, though, because as that case kind of progressed, then they started asking questions skeptical of the other side.",
      "So, I mean, I think that anyone that comes out and like confidently predicts how the court's going to rule in this case is just wishful thinking. I mean it could be very close. I could see a 5-4 ruling, Trump losing. I could see a 6-3 decision, perhaps, Trump wins.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, on the legal front, the president has gone after some perceived enemies in things like executive orders, announced, you know, stripping away of security clearances, even of people who don't even currently have one, but he's made his point. But his attempt to prosecute opponents hasn't been quite as simple. What are you seeing?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: He campaigned a year ago arguing he'd end the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political enemies. And what did we see in 2025? An awful lot of investigations and criminal cases against his political critics. We saw these flailing attempts to charge James Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general. Those cases were dismissed. And twice in the past few weeks grand juries have said no to efforts to try to resuscitate the case against Letitia James. Grand juries rarely say no to prosecutors. That was a profound thing.",
      "And I think more fundamentally, Margaret, it's not just the cases or the investigations or the calls. It's the changes inside of the Department of Justice. They have purged out prosecutors who handled cases Trump doesn't like, bringing in potentially new voices that critics would say are poised to weaponize against critics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And a tacit administration from the White House chief of staff that there is a retribution campaign in the article written by \"Vanity Fair\" Chris Whipple. Susie Wiles said, yes, she was going to try to put a time limit on that, unsuccessfully, but acknowledging what Scott just said is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on this question, though, of limits to authority, Major, we've seen some limits to congressional power, or at least willingness to exert its authority. Do you think it's going to change this year?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The political contours of the Congress going into 2026 are going to really flow through how anxious are Republicans about their own ability to obtain re-election. And do they have to create some noticeable difference between themselves and the president and the Trump administration Through all 2025 the answer to that was, no, we're good, we're staying in with Trump. But if the atmosphere, which currently exists, leading to some retirements, continues to worsen, you will see more congressional pushback. Does it manifold in a way that stops Trump and the administration cold? No, but it complicates things. And if anyone leaves the cabinet, the idea of who the nominee is and what their Senate confirmation prospects are will be filtered through this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Costa, on that point, do you see departures from the cabinet happening?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's very possible, though President Trump is not one to just make a move immediately because there's a flurry of news, negative news, about one of his cabinet members. We see he often takes his time to make some of the decisions, and he doesn't like to be pressured to get rid of anybody.",
      "But there are so many people in the so-called MAGA universe who wants these slots. And they are able to get access to this president. A lot of these cabinet officials I've spoken to privately, and their top aides, say they're going to try to make it through the midterm elections and then leave. But if the president is feeling pressure to make some kind of significant change ahead of the midterms, I wouldn't rule anything out based on my reporting.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I can tell you, Margaret, this is not cabinet members, but this \u2013 in the West Wing, that main pack of inner circle advisers is going to stay intact. And that includes Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt, on the way down, that core group of people. They're not going anywhere. I think we will see some senior advisers in the West Wing leave. Just keep in mind that there are some advisers that have young children. So, they might be leaving for family reasons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, there is a perception that the Supreme Court has shown limited resistance to the president's efforts to expand the powers of the executive. Do you think that's fair? And do you think on that big case that's coming with birthright citizenship, that they will find in his favor?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think there is the perception because of the way the court has handled some of these emergency requests from the Trump administration to step in to these cases and put lower court rulings on hold while the litigation plays out. So, that would let the policies take effect. And the Trump administration has had tremendous success, I mean well over 20 such requests have been granted to let some of these policies go into effect, whether it's on deportations, on immigration stops, mass firings. But those are temporary, interim orders. And the administration has been very strategic and only appealing these adverse rulings from courts below that it thinks it can win. Again, these are just interim orders. Once we do get to the merits, I don't think Trump's going to win all these cases. And I certainly don't think he's going to win the birthright citizenship case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: No, absolutely not. He may not win the tariff's case. Right now it's looking great for Trump in the Supreme Court, but it may look very different come June when we have kind of gotten through some of these big, landmark rulings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Jan's beat is going to be at the center of the 2026 politics, tariffs, Voting Rights Act, and birthright citizenship. All will have massive, political consequences.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, and so many social issue cases as well. Transgender participation in girl's sports. We've got two huge gun rights cases. This is a highly consequential term for the court.",
      "And, you know, it's going to be in conflict, I think, with President Trump by the end of the term because he's not going to like all these rulings.",

      "Predictions for 2026.",
      "Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: My motto as a reporter is assume nothing. And we're very early in the 2028 presidential cycle and discussion. Governor Newsom of California, Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Pritzker of Illinois, the list goes on. But my prediction is, in 2026, we're going to see some names we're not discussing at all start to emerge as possible contenders for the Democrats in 2028. Some celebrities might come into the mix. And one name I would venture, based on some recent reporting, Stephen A. Smith, the sports personality, is talking to people in the Democratic Party about whether he has a future. Whether he runs or not, TBD. But something to watch, celebrity politics in the age of Trump on both sides.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan Crawford.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm going to revisit a prediction I made last year when I kind of confidently said that Justice Alito was probably going to retire and give President Trump his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court. Sources close to Justice Alito say he has not made up his mind. He, in many ways, is too young to retire. He's 75 years old. But then there's the concern that he's too old not too, because if he cares about his legacy, and he is that intellectual leader of the conservative wing, if he cares about his legacy with a Republican in the White House or a Republican- controlled Senate, this year would be the best time for him to retire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think Americans will begin or increasingly feel the effects of DOGE. There's an awful lot of people that lost their jobs in the last 12 months. A lot of long-time career civil servants who were good at delivering products for the American citizens. In my world, the Department of Justice, there have been 5,000 people. That can't help but slow down prosecutions, investigations, and doing right by American people. And that's true across the board in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Fraud investigations. I think you're going to see this administration really dig in deeper to try to find evidence that proves fraud in various government programs. People cheating the system, trying to fleece taxpayers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, I'm going to be the glue for this process because we have predictions and underreported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We get \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mine merge together.",
      "So, prediction is, data centers and A.I. expansion will be an underappreciated but potent political issue in 2026. Eight executive ordered signed by President Trump related to artificial intelligence just behind tariffs and immigration. He has made himself the A.I. president. Yet, let me give you some names of state, Indiana, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, all in one way or another, on the Republican side, are up in arms about either A.I. regulation, lack thereof, or data centers and their implications. Sixty percent in our most recent poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans believe artificial intelligence will not increase jobs but take jobs away. And 44 percent in our most recent poll want more regulation of A.I. than less. This is a wedge issue that Democrats have identified because it is not cohered on the MAGA side. The president has already put down his chips on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Underreported . What did you want to report that you couldn't?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I love, to Scott's point, I'm going to build on it Elon Musk and the DOGE team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: They promised to cut the federal workforce. We're at the end of the year. So, what is the tally for the year? It is 271,000 workers. That's according to the latest jobs report that showed how many workers the federal government shed. So, just to put that into perspective, that's roughly the population of Madison, Wisconsin. So, imagine if every single person in Madison, Wisconsin, were to lose their job, either ousted or they leave their job.",
      "So, the bottom line on DOGE is that they did not succeed in cutting overall government spending, but they did fulfill their mission to trim the federal headcount by roughly about 10 percent. And I think it's going to be important to track those workers and to see where they end up, what their fates are, because they are not being scooped up in the private sector, at least not yet.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There was some attention, but not the requisite attention to the thermonuclear use of pardons in 2025. Blanket pardons, family pardons, preemptive pardons. Is the next person going to bring it back to what we've enjoyed over the past couple centuries, the traditional controversies around pardons?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, under reported?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, there is a narrative that the Supreme Court is corrupt. I mean we saw that emerge in the wake of the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe versus Wade. And now we see it, that they're in the tank for Trump. Not only is that narrative overreported, it is patently false, and it is dangerous for the institution and the public's faith and confidence in the rule of law. This is a conservative Supreme Court. It has been a conservative Supreme Court for 20 years. People can disagree and do disagree with their opinions, but it's profoundly wrong to call it \u2013 or say corruption where there, in fact, is none.",
      "What's underreported is any understanding of what this court's been doing for the past 20 years. Its views of its role, vis-a-vis the other branches. How it sees the law. How it's trying, in its focus, to restore some kind of accountability and our constitutional structure.",
      "Again, this is a court that is functional. It is consistent. They are nine justices. They don't necessarily see the Constitution the same way by any means or how to interpret federal law. There's a struggle over the proper way to interpret the Constitution. But that is as it should be. And I think as we approach our 250th anniversary of this country, it's important to think about the court and their rule of law as the justices are doing, especially if we hope to keep democracy intact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big statement, Jan, if we hope to keep democracy intact. My goodness.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: If we lost \u2013 if the public loses confidence in the rule of law, I don't know what that means for democracy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And that's why I think some of the rhetoric about corruption is so, so profoundly irresponsible.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it causes threats.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, yes. Which, again, I mean the justices are under tremendous, and federal judges as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's all institutions, including for (ph) the state.",
      "Bob Costa, your underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Just briefly. One of the most striking stories of the year politically, Zohran Mamdani. Young \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, no. Let me \u2013 let me make my point. One of the most striking stories was Mamdani's victory. The big question a lot of people have is, well, how does this happen? How does this young, Democratic socialist win in New York City? In my view, the most underreported story of the year is how someone laid the foundation for Zohran Mamdani. Someone near 50 years older, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent, Democratic socialist of Vermont, had what's called a \"Fight Oligarchy Tour\" earlier in 2025, drawing thousands of people in red states and blue states. Sanders enabled Mamdani, and others like him, to start to gain traction for Democratic socialism inside of the Democratic construct in this country in 2025.",

      "The brand new ball \u2013 the ninth ball to be used since 1907 \u2013 is the biggest ever, weighing in at 12,350 pounds.",
      "Michael Phillips, president of Jamestown, the company that is redeveloping One Times Square into a year-round destination, gave \"Sunday Morning\" a close-up look at the ball, covered in over 5,000 handcrafted circular Waterford Crystal discs. \"They're in three different sizes, three different puck sizes, and round versus triangular, which was the old geometric dome pattern,\" Phillips said.",
      "It's a self-contained light show with many special effects.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think the ball drop means so much to so many people?\"",
      "\"It's something that symbolizes releasing what was, and looking forward at what's to come,\" Phillips replied.",
      "And there is more to come: After it completes its New Year's Eve descent welcoming 2026, the ball will drop AGAIN, on the eve of July 4, to mark the 250th anniversary of the nation's birth.",

    "summary": "The bad news from the past year (and there was a lot of it) drowned out much of the GOOD news that made smaller headlines. David Pogue reports on some of 2025's best underreported stories.",
    "story": [
      "Good morning! And this is \u2026 the good news of the year!",
      "Yeah, I know, I know. I've heard the jokes. \"The good news in 2025? This is gonna be a really short broadcast!\" But that's only because the good news got drowned out by all the bad news.",
      "We begin today with \u2026 plastics!",
      "Compostable plastics",
      "Plastic is made of petroleum. And when we throw it away, it breaks down into tiny particles that wind up in our bodies, our blood, and our brains.",
      "So, where's the good news? Material that may look like ordinary plastic, but this stuff is made from sugar cane, and it's completely biodegradable. \"It's compostable plastic,\" said Andrew Brousseau, who runs Black Earth Compost near Boston. \"The key is that they break down, and they don't leave microplastics in our soils.\"",
      "At Black Earth Compost, these better plastics break down along with household food scraps to become valuable compost for farms and gardens.",
      "The finished product? Compost \u2013 \"Black gold\" \u2013 that's safe, with no microplastics in our brain.",
      "Max Senechal is an executive at CJ Biomaterials in Woburn, Mass., one of several companies now making completely compostable plastics.",
      "\"The good news now in '25 is that we've reached a point where we can produce these at large scale,\" Senechal said.",
      "Take for example a biodegradable plastic straw. Senechal said it \"gives you all the functionality without the guilt!\"",
      "Disagreement",
      "If we can all agree on anything, it's that we can't agree on anything.",
      "\"We certainly have gotten to a place where disagreement is mostly just corrosive,\" said Northwestern University professor Eli Finkel. \"We need to find a way to do it better.\"",
      "Finkel may have found it. He co-created the Center for Enlightened Disagreement at Northwestern University, one of several new projects to help us disagree better, such as running exercises that teach students how to disagree.",
      "\"In fact, the first program involved the use of improv techniques,\" Finkel said. \"For example, imagine that your job is to rant for one full minute about something that makes you very, very angry. My job is to take that information and present to everybody what it is that you value \u2013 not why you're angry, not what you are opposed to, but what is underneath the anger that you feel.\"",
      "Does it work? \"I feel very hopeful,\" said Finkel. \"The students are really leaning in to this idea that, to be a productive member of a multicultural society, we need to be able at least to listen and understand what the people who disagree with us believe.\"",
      "He said the goal is to apply this dynamic to the demographic at large: \"If we can achieve here what it looks like we're achieving, I think it won't take us long before we're able to spread this not only to other institutions of higher education, but to high schools and perhaps even beyond,\" Finkel said.",
      "Popup Wetlands",
      "Everyone knows that birds fly South for the winter, and back again in the spring. But these are not nonstop flights; they need places along their long journeys to stop, eat, and sleep.",
      "According to The Nature Conservancy's Katie Riley, California has lost at least 90% of the lakes and marshes that were once layover spots, thanks to urban growth, modern agriculture, and climate change. Her team's radical idea: Pay farmers to flood their fallow fields during migration times, creating \"pop-up\" wetlands.",
      "Riley said, \"Some birds, like the sandhill cranes we're seeing out here today, use those flooded fields actually to sleep. Much smaller birds, they need flooded fields to be able to feed and access little bugs in the field.\"",
      "I asked, \"If you weren't paying farmers to flood their fields here, what would happen to those birds that are trying to migrate?\"",
      "\"They would not survive,\" Riley replied. \"We would see populations go down.\"",
      "This year, the farmers in the BirdReturns program are offering about 50,000 acres of bird rest stops.",
      "Ben Leacox, general manager of Zuckerman Family Farms in Lodi, Calif., said not only do birds benefit from it, but farmers do, too: \"This program may be the difference between me being in the black or the red this year,\" he said. \"This is a win-win transaction for everybody.\"",
      "AI and Med",
      "You might not expect to find artificial intelligence on a \"good-news\" show. [\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f] But in healthcare, AI is bringing enormous advances in predicting disease, discovering new drugs and, especially, diagnosing illnesses.",
      "\"It's pretty darned good,\" said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He's also author of an upcoming book about artificial intelligence in medicine: \"A Giant Leap: How AI Is Transforming Healthcare and What That Means for Our Future.\"",
      "He gave us a demonstration, by providing a patient's symptoms to ChatGPT: \"I have a 28-year-old patient, she's lost a bunch of weight in the last six weeks. She's kind of tremulous, she's shaking. She's pretty sweaty, and her stools are loose. Can you gimme a sense of what might be going on?\"",
      "ChatGPT replied: \"Based on those symptoms, it sounds like she could be dealing with something like hyperthyroidism. Of course, you'd want to confirm that with some thyroid function tests.\"",
      "But we know that AI sometimes can make stuff up \u2013 what's known as \"AI hallucinations.\" Isn't that a risk? \"It can be, and it's something we worry about,\" Wachter said. \"And it's why, at least for now, you don't want this thing diagnosing by itself. We talk about the doctor in the loop.",
      "\"It's getting better every year, and I think this was the year that we turned a corner, where this is going to be something of a golden era in medicine over the next five or ten years,\" he said.",

      "\"Black Moses: A Saga of Ambition and the Fight for a Black State\" (Riverhead Books) is the latest book by award-winning journalist Caleb Gayle, author of \"We Refuse to Forget: A True Story of Black Creeks, American Identity, and Power.\"",

      "\"We will have a new party, that of negro supremacy in at least one State, with negro State and county officers, and negro Senators and Representatives in Congress,\" said a young but seasoned Black politician, Edward Preston McCabe, in 1891. With the Pyrrhic advances of Reconstruction after the Civil War becoming a memory, and Black people attacked and disempowered across the United States\u2014both South and North\u2014McCabe was promising something that sounded impossible, but it wasn't. Indeed, that's why the reporter to whom McCabe was talking had come all the way from Minnesota to Oklahoma Territory in the first place. Even as America's western frontier was on the precipice of being overrun, this reporter had come to witness a run on the land. Claiming that land was the first step toward a better life for thousands of Black people, the\u00a0 forty\u2011year\u2011old McCabe was\u00a0 known\u2014sometimes\u00a0 derisively\u2014as \"the One Who Would Be the Moses.\"",
      "At noon on September 22, 1891, along the borders of the Indian Territory, rifles were fired, pistols went off, cannons blazed, all signaling the official start of the new opening of Oklahoma Territory to settlement. With that, lands that had previously been granted permanently by the U.S. government to several Indigenous nations including the Sac and Fox, the Iowa, the Shawnee, and the Potawatomi were now declared free to whoever could grab them and, crucially, to hold them against all others. The night before, some twenty\u2011five thousand people\u2014Black, white, and Indigenous\u2014huddled at the borders of Native lands. Poor whites from across the country hoped that Oklahoma would be another iteration of an America that would favor them. Black families left the harsh conditions of the Jim Crow South as well as the North and bordering states to grab at a hope that felt tactile. Citizens of Indigenous nations watched as newcomers made their lands sites of fulfilling dreams of building their personal fortunes.",
      "The tens of thousands at the border waited with anticipation and a sense of opportunity for a once\u2011in\u2011a\u2011lifetime chance articulated in simple, transactional terms: Whether rich or poor or something in between, all could run and ride to find land. Stake their ground. Develop their land and stay on it for five years. If they did, that land, 160 acres in total, would be theirs. That land would be their stake in tomorrow.",

    "summary": "The couple's children say their father is innocent and point out that he had 28 guns in the basement if he really wanted to kill her.",
    "story": [
      "Todd Kendhammer says his wife Barbara died in a freak car accident. But authorities questioned his story from the beginning, and he was tried and convicted of intentional homicide.",
      "Kendhammer and his children have refused to accept the verdict and are seeking a new trial. Their fight for what they say is justice is the focus of \"Mystery on County Road M,\"\u00a0reported by \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty. An encore of the broadcast is streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Just after 8 a.m. on September 16, 2016, a distraught Todd Kendhammer called 911 to report a car accident on a rural road outside La Crosse, Wisconsin. \"A pipe or something came through the windshield,\" he told the operator.",
      "When authorities arrived, he told them a pipe flew off a truck driving in the opposite direction, came through the windshield and struck his wife. Barbara Kendhammer, 46, was rushed to the hospital but died the next day. The couple had just celebrated their 25th anniversary.",
      "Their children, Jessica Servais and Jordan Kendhammer, say their parents were still very much in love. \"Whatever my mom wanted, my dad gave it to her,\" Servais told Moriarty. \"They were just in a really good time in their lives 'cause they had their first grandchild, and they were well off.\"",
      "An autopsy revealed that Barbara died of blunt force injuries to the head and neck. She also had three lacerations to the back of her head. The medical examiner did not think Barbara's injuries were consistent with the accident as described by Todd.",
      "\"She said that the injuries to Barb were very inconsistent with a pipe \u2026 that size and that weight coming through the windshield,\" says Tim Gruenke, La Crosse County district attorney.",
      "Surveillance video from a horse ranch down the road showed what appears to be the Kendhammer car pass by at approximately 7:57 a.m. on the day of the incident. But at around the same time, no truck that matched the description Todd gave police was ever seen heading in the opposite direction.",
      "Todd Kendhammer told police that he and Barbara were driving to pick up a truck that needed a windshield replaced, belonging to a man named Justin Heim. Kendhammer did windshield replacement work as a side job.",
      "\"When the police looked into that, they found Justin Heim never had ordered a windshield from Todd, didn't need a windshield. Todd didn't even know where he lived,\" says Gruenke. Kendhammer then told police he was going to see a friend of Heim's.",
      "Gruenke believes Todd Kendhammer killed Barbara and staged the scene to look like an accident. Kendhammer was arrested three months later and went on trial a year after that. \"Every day I was in a constant state of anxiety and couldn't eat and couldn't sleep,\" says Jessica.",
      "At trial, both sides argued about what caused Barbara's injuries \u2014 a tragic accident, or a brutal fight. The windshield was as hotly disputed as the medical evidence. Dueling experts had different theories of what caused the glass fracture patterns.",
      "Jessica and Jordan don't believe prosecutors ever answered critical questions about what happened.",
      "\"They never really said how he killed her or what he did to stage everything,\" says Jessica. Her brother added, \"If he wanted to kill Ma, why the hell would he go through all the work and trouble to find a pipe, drive all the way out to the middle of a busy road\u2014.\" \"He has like 28 guns in the basement,\" Jessica interrupted. \"More than that,\" said Jordan.",
      "The prosecution had to admit they didn't know why Todd would kill Barbara. They found no evidence either one was having an affair, no history of domestic violence or financial trouble.",
      "Todd Kendhammer made the unusual decision to testify in his own defense. He told the jury he was distraught during his interview with police, when he told those different stories of where they were going that morning. \"I'm not in the right state of mind\u2026 I wasn't thinking of where I was going or what I was doing. I was thinking of Barb,\" he said on the stand.",
      "But he continued to struggle with his memory of the incident and told the jury about a third person he was going to see that morning. Gruenke asked him: \"Did you change your story for trial because you knew police had figured out your lies?\" \"No,\" he responded.",
      "Todd Kendhammer's children stood by him. \"He doesn't lie. So when he says he didn't do it, we believe him,\" Jessica said. But the jury didn't believe him, and Kendhammer was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole in 30 years.",
      "After the conviction, the Kendhammer family hired attorney Jerry Buting, of \"Making a Murderer\" fame, to handle the appeal, along with his wife and co-counsel Kathleen Stilling.",
      "\"This was an accident,\" Buting told Moriarty. \"The idea that out of the blue he would snap and kill his wife and then stage the accident, it just seems so implausible to me,\" Stilling added.",
      "In 2021, Todd Kendhammer was back in court before the same judge for an evidentiary hearing. It was a chance to argue that his original defense team had been ineffective, and that there was critical new evidence.\u00a0The forensic pathologist who testified there disagreed with the original medical examiner and said Barbara's injuries were caused by an accident.",
      "\"We aren't going to stop until he can be home,\" Jessica says.",
      "Prosecutor Gruenke believes justice has already been served for Barbara Kendhammer. \"Do you have any concerns at all that you might have convicted an innocent man?\" Moriarty asked. \"Not in this case, no,\" Gruenke replied.",

      "Now, Todd Kendhammer's appeals team says his murder conviction is the true injustice that occurred in this controversial case.",

      "Lawyer Jerry Buting is best known for defending Steven Avery, on Netflix's \"Making a Murderer.\" And now, along with attorney Kathleen Stilling, who also happens to be his wife, they've taken on Todd's case, which they say should be measured by his marriage to Barbara.",
      "Kathleen Stilling: Their relationship was really special. \u2026 that was one of the things that really drew me to this case. \u2026 The idea that out of the blue he would snap and kill his wife and then stage the accident, it just seems so implausible to me.",
      "They insist this isn't a murder mystery. It's an old-fashioned love story that ended in a tragic accident. During his trial, Todd told the court that he fell for Barbara, at first sight.",

      "For extra income Todd also worked with glass, replacing people's smashed and broken windshields. They paid their bills and lived comfortably.",

      "It was a month later, September 16, 2016.\u00a0 The Kendhammer family was preparing for their annual camping trip.\u00a0 The plan was to leave later that day after Barb finished work.",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: I woke up in the morning. \u2026 Ma and dad were still home. I heard mom in the kitchen.",
      "It was early that morning. Jordan, home from college, says he heard the garage door open, and his parents' car leave. No arguing. Nothing unusual, he says, just his dad, likely driving his mom to work at school.",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: If he had off, he'd take her to work and he'd go about doing his errand things. And then when he got done, he'd pick her up.",
      "A little after 7:45 a.m., the couple stopped at the home of a neighbor. They were looking after her house while she was away and stayed just a few minutes. And then, surprisingly, instead of heading to Barbara's school, Todd headed north \u2014 away from it.\u00a0 Why he did would become a critical question.",
      "At 8:05 a.m., a distraught Todd made that call to 911. He said there had been a horrible accident. And Barbara was badly hurt.",
      "911 OPERATOR: 911 what is the address of the emergency?",

      "Todd Kendhammer says the pipe flew off a truck, smashed into the windshield of the car he was driving and caused his wife Barbara's death \u2014 a story that Prosecutor Tim Gruenke says is simply preposterous.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Our theory is that he used that himself to put the hole in the windshield. It didn't fly off of a truck going by.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Todd said he was traveling north on Highway M.",
      "Gruenke says that police became suspicious of Todd when pieces of his story just didn't seem to add up, starting with that mysterious truck.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He turned right onto Bergum Coulee Road.",
      "This is the description Todd Kendhammer gave police on the way to the hospital:",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: It was a older, like a bigger flatbed-looking truck \u2026 Like a pickup truck with a flatbed on it.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: What color was the cab?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER:\u00a0 I don't even remember. It was darker, I don't \u2014 that's all I know. Dark green or dark blue.",
      "Erin Moriarty (at the scene, pointing at road): So, he's going this way and he claims that the \u2014 that a truck carrying a pipe was going this way?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Correct.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you ever able to find a truck?",
      "Tim Gruenke: No. Police spent some time looking for the truck and putting out word to the community to ask if anybody saw a truck that day.",
      "Surveillance video from a horse ranch down the road does show what appears to be the Kendhammer car pass by at approximately 7:57 a.m. on the day of the incident. But at around the same time, no truck that matched the description Todd gave police was ever seen heading in the opposite direction.",
      "And then four days after the incident, Medical Examiner Dr. Kathleen McCubbin conducted an autopsy on Barbara.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She didn't understand when she first heard a pipe had done it. She had called law enforcement to look at the pipe 'cause she didn't understand how that could be.",
      "Barbara had three lacerations on the back of her head.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She said that the injuries to Barb were very inconsistent with a pipe of that size and that weight coming through the windshield.",
      "She concluded that Barbara died of \"blunt trauma injuries of the head and neck, with skull fractures \u2026 cricoid cartilage fractures \u2026 and ultimate brain death.\" The cricoid is the ring-shaped bony cartilage structure located in the lower neck.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you believe caused the broken cricoid cartilage?",
      "Tim Gruenke: It's consistent with strangulation.",
      "The medical examiner also noted that there were countless other injuries on Barbara that suggested there could have been an earlier struggle. She had scratches on her neck, a broken nose, a laceration on her forehead and bruising all over her body.",
      "Tim Gruenke: She had some injuries to her fingers.",
      "Todd also had injuries to his hands.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He said that came from striking the windshield when he saw something flying at him.",
      "And he had what appeared to be scratches on his neck and chest as well.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He said he got that 'cause he worked with glass. It turns out he doesn't work with glass. He puts in windshields. But he doesn't normally work with glass or broken glass. So those injuries seemed odd. \u2026 It seems consistent like someone who was in a fight. A really bad fight.",
      "Police had also interviewed a construction worker who said he drove by the Kendhammer car around 8 a.m. but didn't see any damage to the windshield or any people around.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He saw the car in the ditch. \u2026 And thought maybe somebody had just driven off the road or tried to make a turn and got stuck.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, he didn't see anybody. He didn't see either Todd or Barbara?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Correct.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Could they have been hidden in the high grass?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Well, that's the only thought is that \u2026 he was maybe trying to hold her down and keep her from calling for help.",
      "There were other red flags. On the day of the incident Barbara was scheduled to work at 8 a.m., but she never called to say that she'd be late. She also did not make her daily call her to her mom.",
      "Tim Gruenke: As a woman who has never been later for work, who always calls her mom \u2026 when you look at, that's an obvious change of the pattern.",
      "And where were Todd and Barbara driving to that morning, going in the opposite direction from Barbara's work?",
      "This is what Todd Kendhammer told investigators on the drive to the hospital:",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: I'm gonna put a windshield in a truck for a guy.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: So, is the windshield you were going to replace in somebody's driveway or?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: In his truck. I was gonna take it to my house.",
      "Todd told police that, on the way to drive Barbara to work, he decided to drive over to pick up a truck that needed a windshield replaced. He said the truck, with keys inside, was in the driveway of a person he knew from work named Justin Heim.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Did you call the guy?",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: No, I didn't call him. \u2026 I was just gonna swing over and if it was there grab it.",
      "But when the investigators spoke with Justin Heim, he told a very different story.",
      "Tim Gruenke: When the police looked into that, they found Justin Heim never had ordered a windshield from Todd, didn't need a windshield. Todd didn't even know where he lived.",
      "So just one week after Barbara's death and just two days before her funeral, investigators asked Todd to come down to the police station under the ruse that they had some leads on trucks that may have dropped the pipe that day.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER [in interrogation room, opening pill container]: Is it OK if I take that? I didn't take my medicine this morning.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: Yeah, that's fine.",
      "As investigators began to question him, Todd told them he had not taken his anti-anxiety medication, and he appeared confused and forgetful of details.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER [distraught, holding his head in his hands]: And \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 just don't \u2014 remember, I remember \u2014 and I don't know how \u2026 I remember \u2014 I remember the worst part was when I looked \u2014 the pipe was \u2014 the pipe was there \u2026\"",
      "Jessica Servais: He was trying to help. Like he thought they were trying to help him find the cause of the accident.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: How did the pipe get through the windshield, let's start there.",
      "TODD KENDHAMMER: The pipe \u2014 I don't \u2014 It came off a truck.",
      "But they were closing in on what they believed were Todd's lies.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: There's no explanations for it. You can't \u2014 the injuries that were on Barb did not occur from that accident, from a pipe going through your windshield.",
      "And then, when police pressed him about where he was actually going that day, Todd Kendhammer changed his story.",
      "INVESTIGATOR: I talked to Justin.",
      "Tim Gruenke: He \u2026 told a story that he wasn't going to Justin Heim's house. It was actually a friend of Justin's.",
      "Police would later find that friend who told them he also didn't need a windshield and was not expecting Todd the day of the incident.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Isn't it possible he was in shock? Isn't it possible that he just can't remember anything from that time?",
      "Tim Gruenke: Part of it. \u2026 I could see somebody not remembering a detail or two. Not remembering something traumatic. But the things that surround it you usually do remember. \u2026 So, things like remembering where you were going.",
      "After 3-and-a-half hours of questioning Todd, investigators let him go home, but they kept building their case.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Do I know exactly blow-by-blow how it happened? No, I don't. But I know it didn't happen from a pipe coming off a truck.",
      "Three months after Barbara's death, Todd Kendhammer was arrested.",
      "Jessica Servais: We were basically just like, \"Well how we get him back out?\" Because he is not supposed to be in there \u2026",
      "Jessica hoped a jury would believe her father when Todd took the stand to tell his side of the story at his trial.",

      "In December 2017 when Todd Kendhammer went to trial for his wife Barbara's murder, almost everyone who attended was there to support him. Yet, his daughter Jessica feared the worst.",
      "Jessica Servais: Every day I was in a constant state of anxiety and couldn't eat and couldn't sleep.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN | Medical examiner: The cause of Barbara Kendhammer's death was blunt impact injuries of her head and neck.",
      "The state's star witness was Medical Examiner Dr. Kathleen McCubbin.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: I did not believe that these injuries are consistent with the end of a pipe striking the back of the head.",
      "Todd's trial lawyer Stephen Hurley didn't call a forensic pathologist of his own to dispute the state's case but tried to create reasonable doubt during cross-examination.",
      "STEPHEN HURLEY: If her head were moving at the time of the pipe coming through, the pipe had the potential, because it is some 5 feet long, to strike her head in more than one place, is that correct?",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: That may be possible, yes.",
      "Attorney Hurley asked McCubbin if Barbara's large water mug could have slammed into her face if she ducked to avoid the pipe and caused some of the injuries.",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: Yes, it could be. It's a possibility.",

      "MARK MESHULAM: By observing the crack branching ...",
      "The fracture patterns on the windshield, he said, show three different events.",
      "MARK MESHULAM: The first one was a hand impact, when Mr. Kendhammer's fist went into the glass.",
      "The second event was the puncture when the pipe broke through the windshield. \u00a0And the third, harder to detect, was caused, he said, when Todd removed the pipe from the windshield.",
      "NICK STAHLKE: The lines that are highlighted here would indicate those impact points.",
      "But the state's forensic expert Nick Stahlke said the impacts didn't occur in the order that Meshalum said they did. District Attorney Gruenke argues this is more evidence showing that Todd Kendhammer intentionally damaged the windshield, and it was not from a pipe falling off a truck.",
      "Tim Gruenke: It couldn't have done what he said it did. \u2026 The crime lab found that the windshield had two strikes on the outside which is impossible. However the pipe comes, it's not going to hit, back up again and hit again.",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: If he wanted to kill ma, why the hell would he go through all the work and trouble to find a pipe, drive all the way out to the middle of a busy road \u2014",

      "Jessica Servais: They never really said how he killed her or what he did to stage everything. If what they're saying is he staged it and killed her at the same time, the time frame doesn't fit up either. You don't have enough time to do all that stuff.",
      "Because that construction worker drove by at 8 a.m. that morning, Todd had just 5 minutes to stage the crime before he called 911 at 8:05 a.m.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, in that short period of time he had the presence of mind to go get the pipe out of the trunk, go around, break it twice \u2026 and call 911 and administer CPR.",
      "Tim Gruenke: Yes. \u2026 He can do a lot of damage in 2 or 3 minutes. So, it's more time than people think.",

      "TODD KENDHAMMER: Correct.",

      "But Jessica says Gerianne had been estranged from their mother.",
      "Jessica Servais: She basically painted this scene that \u2026 she just feels so bad about my mom and her big blue eyes, even though her eyes are green. \u2026 My mom hates her.",
      "\"48 Hours\" reached out to Gerianne and she denies Jessica's claims that she was estranged from Barbara. But her testimony wasn't the only surprise that day. Gruenke had some harsh words for the Kendhammer family, who had to sell Todd and Barbara's home and Jessica's house to pay Todd's legal bills.",
      "TIM GRUENKE [at sentencing]: Pardon my language, but to be perfectly frank they need to get their head out of their ass. They need to start looking at this in reality \u2026",
      "Jessica Servais: I don't think you should be able to talk that way in a courtroom.\u00a0 If you can think that to yourself, that's fine because I also think you're an ass, but I'm not going to say it out loud.",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: At least word it different.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Don't you think you may have added to their pain at that sentencing by saying that?",
      "Tim Gruenke: I think I have to open their eyes in some way. \u2026\u00a0 I think they are giving him false hope. And I think he's dragging them down with him by using all their money to continue in his lies.",

      "NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED",
      "Todd Kendhammer's verdict was guilty. But Jessica and Jordan are determined to clear his name.",
      "Jessica Servais: Because he didn't do it. \u2026\u00a0 And he doesn't lie. So, when he says he didn't do it, we believe him.",
      "That belief is why Barbara and Todd's children brought on Jerry Buting and Kathleen Stilling, who understand that undoing a murder conviction is an immense challenge.",
      "Jerry Buting: It's very difficult to reverse a judgement that's become final.",
      "Kathleen Stilling: it's kind of like trying to turn an aircraft carrier. It's slow \u2026 and difficult to do.",
      "Still, they overcame a big first hurdle: getting back in court.",
      "Todd Kendhammer was granted an evidentiary hearing. It was a chance to argue that his original defense team had been ineffective, and that there was critical, new evidence.",
      "Jessica Servais: We were grateful that the judge was taking the time to see what we had come up with.",
      "And four years after his conviction for the intentional homicide of his wife Barbara, inmate Kendhammer was back in front of Judge Todd Bjerke.",
      "It opened the courthouse doors a crack, to the possibility of a new trial.",

      "Jessica Servais: Yeah.",
      "The burden is now on the defense. Jerry Buting starts by calling a forensic pathologist, something Todd's first defense team had elected not to do.",
      "Jerry Butting: They chose to go a different route. And I think that was serious mistake that really damaged Todd's ability to defend himself.",
      "But now Dr. Shaku Teas, who has performed some 6,000 autopsies, would examine Barbara Kendhammer's medical records and autopsy photos.",
      "JERRY BUTING: Did you observe anything on her body that was consistent with Barbara Kendhammer having been beaten with fists?",

      "PROSECUTOR SUSAN DONSKEY: Consistent with strangulation?",
      "DR. KATHLEEN MCCUBBIN: It could be, yes.",
      "But for Dr. Teas, the stark photos and silent sketches tell a different story.",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: I don't see any injuries on Barbara that I would say are suggestive or consistent with strangulation.",
      "And Dr. Teas suggests that the injury to Barbara's cricoid could be due to that large travel mug.",
      "JERRY BUTING: So, if she had that in her lap when she's moving forward, could that have caused the cricoid fracture",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS:\u00a0 It could be the mug.",

      "Erin Moriarty: If the pipe is coming in \u2026 how would she get severe injuries in the back of her head?",
      "Jerry Buting: Because she ducked, and the pipe came through like that (ducks his head and upper body) and grazed the back of her head.",
      "DR. SHAKU TEAS: Barbara Kendhammer died as a result of \u2026 an automobile accident.",
      "And Teas believes some injuries seen in the autopsy came from the final act of Barbara Kendhammer's generosity: the harvesting of her donated organs.",
      "But DA Gruenke doesn't buy the theories of Dr. Teas.",
      "Tim Gruenke: I don't put a lot of faith in her testimony.",
      "But when it comes to Todd Kendhammer's guilt or innocence, Buting and Stilling say there is more than just physical evidence to consider.",
      "DR. GEOFFREY LOFTUS [testifying via Zoom]: Something very traumatic and attention-grabbing had occurred, which would likely obliterate any short-term memory that Mr. Kendhammer would have had.",
      "The defense hired another expert, this time in human memory. Dr. Geoffrey Loftus testified that Todd Kendhammer's various stories could be a result of stress from a terrible accident.",
      "KATHLEEN STILLING: Would you say that this was a situation that was ripe for an inaccurate memory?",
      "DR. GEOFFREY LOFTUS: Yes.",
      "Still the most controversial aspect of this story is about that pipe that Todd claims crashed through his windshield and killed Barbara.",
      "As part of their initial investigation, local authorities had attempted to reconstruct Todd's story of the deadly incident on County Road M.",
      "They tested, and taped, dropping a similar pipe off the back of a truck to see if it could, in fact, bounce. The idea: to determine if a pipe might have bounced high enough to hit the windshield of Todd's oncoming car.",
      "But Kendhammer's lawyers thought the pipe test was inconclusive. They never shared the investigators' video with judge or jury. And neither did the state.",
      "Tim Gruenke: I didn't think we needed it. The defense didn't want it. We just agreed not to use it.",
      "It was only at the new evidentiary hearing that the pipe test was finally presented in court.",
      "Jerry Buting: The first time the judge ever even heard about those experiments was in our motion.",
      "Butting and Stilling shared the pipe test video with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: What you're showing me is that the state's own experts did an experiment that if in fact the pipe bounced like this it could've done exactly what Todd said it did.",
      "Jerry Buting: That's right.",
      "Jerry Buting: Now that one hits on its end and look how it bounces.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And come up really high.",
      "Jerry Buting: It comes up high.",
      "Erin Moriarty: In your mind these videos show that it could have happened.",
      "Jerry Buting: That's the point. Yes.",
      "Which contradicts state investigators who, from the beginning, had suggested that a pipe slamming through Todd's windshield was next to impossible.",
      "INVESTIGATOR [during interrogation]: What are the odds that that would happen to a guy that changes out windshields?\u00a0 I mean, what do you suppose those odds are?\u00a0 One in a trillion if at all?",
      "Buting and Stilling introduced evidence from across America to prove it's more common than you think.",
      "Jerry Buting (referencing video evidence): This one is in \u2014 near Bakersfield, California, a pipe that looks remarkably similar that went right through this person's vehicle. Here's another one. \u2026 This one's Houston, OK.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And it goes right through and hits \u2014",
      "Jerry Buting: Would've killed \u2014",
      "Erin Moriarty: A passenger.",
      "And it turns out you don't have to be an expert to find a piece of pipe along a country road.",
      "Jessica Servais: There was another pipe on the road up the ways \u2026 that someone found.",
      "Erin Moriarty: There was a pipe, and when was that pipe found?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: Shortly after.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And it was very similar to the one that went through the windshield?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: Same diameter, same material.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you think happened?",
      "Jordan Kendhammer: I believe the pipe came through and hit mom.",
      "That belief in their father would not waver. Still how could the experts at trial see a case so differently? We decided to ask another forensic pathologist to take a fresh look at the evidence.",
      "Lindsay Thomas: The more I looked at it, the more I understood why it's so complicated.",
      "A COMPLICATED CASE",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas is a forensic pathologist who has performed about 5,000 autopsies.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas:\u00a0 If it didn't happen the way Todd says it happened, then how did it happen?",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: This is the kind of case where it isn't that clear cut.",
      "\"48 Hours\" asked her to review the medical evidence in this case \u2013 including Dr. McCubbin's autopsy report.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: The original autopsy was very well done and the conclusions that they reached were very reasonable.",
      "Still, Dr. Thomas says she wouldn't have reached some of the same conclusions.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: And that's what makes this case so challenging.",
      "The most troubling injury for her is that cricoid fracture on Barbara's neck. She agrees with Dr. Teas, the forensic pathologist who testified for the defense in the evidentiary hearing and does not believe that Barbara was strangled.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: I've never seen a fractured cricoid in strangulation. \u2026 I wouldn't say it absolutely can't happen, but certainly I haven't seen it, I haven't read about it, I haven't heard about it \u2026 it seems more consistent with the kind of thing that would happen \u2014 in a weird car crash.",
      "And she believes the injuries to the back of Barbara's head were too severe to have been caused by Todd's fists. But she says Barbara could have been hit with a heavy object like her mug.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Yeah, it would have to be a substantial coffee cup. But I understand there was a pretty substantial coffee cup in the car.",
      "Ultimately, Dr. Thomas can't say for sure how Barbara sustained her injuries.",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Based on just the medical evidence alone, it wouldn't be one where \u2026 you could definitely say, \"Oh, this is clearly a homicide or clearly an accident.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: The idea that a man is sitting in prison, does that concern you?",
      "Dr. Lindsey Thomas: Well, it always does when you have a case like this that isn't clear cut. \u2026 You just worry a little that the evidence was given too much weight one way or the other, or the jury wasn't given all of the relevant materials.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Had you ever served on a murder trial before as a jury member?",
      "Tim Brennan: No. Not ever.",
      "Tim Brennan, the jury foreman, says he found Dr. McCubbin's testimony very convincing. We shared with him some of the new information from the evidentiary hearing, including Dr. Teas' conclusions.",
      "Erin Moriarty: If you had heard a medical examiner disagree with Dr. McCubbin \u2026 would that have made a difference?",
      "Tim Brennan: Without hearing the full extent \u2026 of that \u2014 it's hard to say.",
      "Still, he stands by the jury verdict.",
      "Tim Brennan: When Todd Kendhammer \u2026 gave his testimony \u2026 He just came across as a person with a lot of falsehoods.",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you say falsehoods, did you feel he was lying?",
      "Tim Brennan: Definitely.",
      "Tim Brennan: I'm very confident that we got it right.",

      "Jessica Servais: I used to be annoyed \u2026 that he would call me all the time, and like always come over, but I kind of miss it now (crying). \u2026 I just miss having them around all the time.",
      "And Jessica's daughter Carlin is growing up without her grandparents.",
      "Jessica Servais: Their dream was always to do stuff with their grandkids \u2026 so it's just hard not to have him with her.",

But the Chinese military didn't bring up the U.S. or Japan in its statement Monday morning.",

    "summary": "The U.S. announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as the Trump administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014 The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Trump's administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
      "The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States' status as the world's largest humanitarian donor.",
      "The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.",
      "The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.",
      "Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.",
      "The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.",
      "The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations \u2014 the world's top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money \u2014 takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.",
      "Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change \u00a0have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.",
      "The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration, or even during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office \u2014 which last year set in motion a \"humanitarian reset\" to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent \u2014 will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.",
      "The United States wants to see \"more consolidated leadership authority\" in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.",
      "Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office \"are going to control the spigot\" on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.",
      "\"This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars \u2014 providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.",
      "U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.",
      "\"The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.\"",
      "\"Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.'s most critical work,\" the department added. \"Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.\"",
      "At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.",
      "One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Mr. Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.",
      "The project, months in the making, stems from Mr. Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise but has failed to live up to it and has, in his eyes, drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.",
      "Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, \"At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:34:26 -0500",
    "summary": "China dominates the supply of critical minerals such as tungsten, but a U.S. push for alternative sources has found one, deep inside a South Korean mountain.",
    "story": [
      "Sangdong mine, South Korea \u2014 Over the course of decades, China has come to dominate the rare earths and critical minerals industries, virtually cornering the market on raw materials that are essential to every aspect of modern life, from cellphones to armor piercing ammunition and AI missile guidance systems.",
      "Beijing's stranglehold on the production of these valuable metals and minerals has driven a hasty search by U.S. authorities to secure alternative supply options.",
      "Lewis Black says his company is ready to help fill the void, at least when it comes to the supply of tungsten, a mineral he calls \"vital\" to U.S. defense needs.",
      "Black, CEO of the Canadian mining company Almonty Industries, flew from New York to South Korea last week to give CBS News a tour of the mine he hopes will soon be producing enough tungsten to meet at least the most urgent of America's needs.",
      "In the days before his flight to the Sangdong mine, Black met with U.S. officials, including at the White House, and he signed a deal guaranteeing that Almonty will, in the future, supply enough tungsten for U.S. security needs.",
      "Black said he couldn't discuss the details of the agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Tungsten's superpower",
      "The power of tungsten is rooted in the fact that it has the highest melting point of any element. While used in everyday items from electrical wiring to semiconductors and batteries, its applications in the defense industry make it truly indispensable.",
      "\"It's vital. It's further than critical, it's vital,\" Black told CBS News, standing in an enormous red building covered in corrugated steel sheeting that houses his processing plant in Sangdong.",
      "As he spoke, machinery that breaks down the ore \u2014 the rocks embedded with tungsten \u2014 ground in a slow circular motion, undergoing tests in preparation for being fully commissioned later this year.",
      "\"It's not just in the things you can see like munitions and armor,\" Black said. \"You want to build armored vehicles? All the engineering, all the AI chips, AI chips you can't build without tungsten gas. You want to build a plane? The rockets, it's in everything. It's a vital component, a small one, but without it, you can't do it.\"",
      "The Sangdong tungsten mine's rise, fall and renaissance",
      "Tungsten was first discovered in a rocky outcrop at the Sangdong site, about 115 miles southeast of Seoul, in 1906. A Japanese company started mining there about a decade later, and the tungsten extracted was later used for Japan's war machine during the Second World War.",
      "The end of that war brought an end to Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and the Sangdong mine returned to Korean control. It would go on to have a profound effect on South Korea's economy, at one point accounting for 30% of the nation's GDP.",
      "South Korean presidents visited the mine at least six times \u2014 it was a source of national pride. But in the 1990s, it fell victim to China's price dumping policies and was mothballed.",
      "For the ensuing three decades, the U.S., along with many other Western nations, benefited from the cheap, government subsidized materials being produced by China.",
      "But that benefit became a reliance, and it left Washington exposed and vulnerable amid a tense trade war with China that's seen Beijing impose export restrictions on some rare earths and other critical materials.",
      "In response, there's been a rush to establish alternative supply chains.",
      "China controls at least 80% of the world's current tungsten supplies, according to Almonty, with Russia and North Korea both holding a smaller but significant share of the assets.",
      "Almonty Industries is in the process of relocating its headquarters to New York. It's a clear indication that the U.S. government has become a very important part of Black's business \u2014 his biggest customer, in fact.",
      "Almonty took ownership of the Sandong mine in 2015.",
      "Catching up with China is \"going to be disruptive\"",
      "Almonty also has tungsten mines in Spain and Portugal, and it recently purchased one in Montana, specifically in the interest, Black said, of U.S. national security.",
      "\"With the U.S. government, that's one of the reasons why we've taken a mine in the U.S. \u2014 bringing our technology to the country so that we can start to generate more human capital for the long term,\" he said. \"To me it feels good for the legacy of the company to fill a gap that has been left hugely exposed.\"",
      "Black said the mine in Montana won't be operational for years, however, as Almonty still needs to secure permits and train personnel. It's all analogous, he notes, to the overarching problem the U.S. and its Western partners have as they seek to untangle themselves from supply chain reliance on China; it's going to take a long time.",
      "\"China dominates so many different sectors, whether it be rare earths, lithium, graphite, tin, lead, aluminum,\" Black said, adding that over the last eight decades many such industries simply \"fell out of favor in the West, and we abandoned raw materials.\"",
      "There are more recently discovered sources of some key materials, particularly in Africa, and the U.S. has sought to build business ties there \u2014 but Black says China has \"covered most bases,\" already securing investment in many African nations through its \"Belt and Road\" initiative.",
      "He believes it will take at least a decade for the U.S. to completely diversify its supply chains, not least because of the need to train a workforce.",
      "\"We don't have the people to run these mines,\" Black told CBS News. \"The U.S. and the West have some catching up to do.\"",
      "In the interim, he expects American industry to face some disruption.",
      "\"I bought this 10 years ago,\" he said of the Sangdong facility. \"Mines in democracies are a journey, and not for the faint hearted.\"",
      "Black expects \"it's going to be a really tough, miserable journey\" as industries such as the American automotive sector work to wean themselves off cheap Chinese raw materials.",
      "\"You want to onshore all this production but you have no way of producing the components to supply this production. This has got to be done \u2026 It's going to be disruptive, there are going to be times when some sectors are going to run out of components \u2014 that's inevitable. In this particular instance, everyone is going to just suck it up and just power forward, because it's the only way it can be done.\"",
      "A few months ago the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency put out a Request for Information (RFI) for tungsten \u2014 effectively an SOS call for the critical mineral, which surprised some in the industry as it effectively exposed the U.S. shortage.",
      "\"I think the U.S. government is saying, 'all right, whatever we can find, we'd better stash it while we build this supply chain,'\" said Black.",
      "He expects the Sangdong to be operational by the first quarter of 2026, and once it is, it should be running 16 hours a day, with the associated processing plant operational 24 hours per day, producing an estimated 1.2 million tons of tungsten ore per year.",

      "Mexico City, Mexico \u2014 Officials said a train accident in southern Mexico killed at least 13 people and injured dozens, halting traffic along a rail line connecting the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The Interoceanic Train linking the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz went off the rails Sunday as it passed a curve near the town of Nizanda.",
      "\"The Mexican Navy has informed me that, tragically, 13 people died in the Interoceanic Train accident,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum posted on X, adding that 98 people were injured, five of them seriously.",
      "She said she instructed the secretary of the navy and the undersecretary of human rights of the Ministry of the Interior to travel to the site and personally assist the families.",
      "In a message on X Sunday, Oaxaca state Gov. Salomon Jara said several government agencies had reached the accident site to assist the injured.",
      "Officials said 241 passengers and nine crew members were on the train when the accident occurred.",
      "The Interoceanic Train was inaugurated in 2023 by then President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The rail service is part of a broader push to boost train travel in southern Mexico and develop infrastructure along the isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The Mexican government plans to turn the isthmus into a strategic corridor for international trade, with ports and rail lines that can connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

      "Ahmed al Ahmed, the man hailed as a hero for tackling one of the gunmen behind an antisemitic attack on Australia's Bondi Beach earlier this month, is speaking out in the aftermath of the massacre.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News that airs Monday on \"CBS Mornings,\" al Ahmed said he \"didn't worry about anything\" except for the lives he could potentially save as he sought to disarm the shooter.",

      "Al Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner, has received international praise for disarming one of two gunmen accused of perpetrating the Dec. 14 mass shooting, which was Australia's worst since 1996.

I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him, drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing, and it's come all in fast,\" al Ahmed said of his struggle to remove the weapon from the gunman's grasp. \"And emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain ... I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help, and that's my soul asking me to do that.\"",

    "summary": "At the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Brigitte Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability.",
    "story": [
      "Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died, according to her foundation. She was 91.",
      "\"The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the passing of its Founder and President, Brigitte Bardot, the world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her Foundation,\" the foundation said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Bruno Jacquelin, with the foundation, told the Associated Press that the late actress died Sunday in southern France. He gave no cause of death and said no arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \"And God Created Woman.\" Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France's best-known stars.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \"Marianne,\" the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot's face appeared on statues, postage stamps and even on coins.",
      "\"We are mourning a legend,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Sunday on social media.",
      "Bardot's second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals; she condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments; and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "A turn to the far right",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot's 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d'Ormale, a onetime adviser to National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \"lovely, intelligent man.\"",
      "In 2012, she wrote a letter in support of the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \"exceptional woman\" who was \"incredibly French.\"",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \"hypocritical\" and \"ridiculous\" because many played \"the teases\" with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \"charming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\"",
      "A privileged, but \"difficult\" upbringing",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy, secretive child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \"difficult\" and said her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "But it was French movie producer Vadim, whom she married in 1952, who saw her potential and wrote \"And God Created Woman\" to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a bored newlywed who beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\" Bardot said of her early films. \"I suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\"",
      "Bardot's unabashed, off-screen love affair with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant further shocked the nation. It eradicated the boundaries between her public and private life and turned her into a hot prize for paparazzi.",
      "Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant press attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broken into her house two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.",
      "Nicolas' father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor whom she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\"I was looking for roots then,\" she said in an interview. \"I had none to offer.\"",
      "In her 1996 autobiography \"Initiales B.B.,\" she likened her pregnancy to \"a tumor growing inside me,\" and described Charrier as \"temperamental and abusive.\"",
      "Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, but the relationship again ended in divorce three years later.",
      "Among her films were \"A Parisian\" (1957); \"In Case of Misfortune,\" in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \"The Truth\" (1960); \"Private Life\" (1962); \"A Ravishing Idiot\" (1964); \"Shalako\" (1968); \"Women\" (1969); \"The Bear And The Doll\" (1970); \"Rum Boulevard\" (1971); and \"Don Juan\" (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963's critically acclaimed \"Contempt,\" directed by Godard, Bardot's films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",
      "\"It was never a great passion of mine,\" she said of filmmaking. \"And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.\"",
      "Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St. Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after \"The Woman Grabber.\"",
      "Reinventing herself in middle age",
      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewelry to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.",
      "Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to then- President Bill Clinton asking why the U.S. Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.",
      "She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.",
      "\"It's true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\" Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter.",
      "In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.",
      "Bardot once said that she identified with the animals that she was trying to save.",
      "\"I can understand hunted animals because of the way I was treated,\" Bardot said. \"What happened to me was inhuman. I was constantly surrounded by the world press.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.",
      "BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.",
      "BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--",
      "MOYNIHAN\u00a0 \u00a0Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?",
      "MOYNIHAN \u00a0 Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --and medium size businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.",
      "MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.",
      "BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--",
      "MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.",
      "BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.",
      "BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.",
      "BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.",
      "BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--",
      "BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--",
      "BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.",
      "BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.",
      "MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.",
      "BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.",
      "BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --even\u2013",
      "BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --20 years ago--",
      "BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--",
      "BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?",
      "MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--",
      "BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.",
      "MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Happy Holidays, thank you.",
      "BRENNAN: Happy Holidays to you.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-drone-missile-strike-kyiv-zelenskyy-trump-meeting/",
    "published": "Sat, 27 Dec 2025 19:07:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Explosions boomed across Kyiv for hours as ballistic missiles and drones hit the city in an attack that began early in the morning.",
    "story": [
      "Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with missiles and drones early Saturday morning, killing one person and wounding 27 others, a day before talks between Ukraine and the U.S., local authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in early morning and continued for hours.",
      "The attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  \u00a0prepares to meet with President Trump\u00a0in Florida on Sunday for further talks in an effort to end the nearly four-year-old war.",
      "\"This attack is Russia's answer on our peace efforts. It really shows that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin doesn't want peace,\" Zelenskyy   said after stopping in Canada to meet with Prime Minister Mark Carney in Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that it carried out a \"massive strike\" overnight, using \"long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air, and sea, including Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles\" and drones, on energy infrastructure facilities \"used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces,\" as well as \"Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises.\"",
      "The ministry said the strike came in response to Ukraine's attacks on \"civilian objects\" in Russia.",
      "Earlier on Saturday, the ministry said its air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight.",
      "Poland scrambled fighter jets and closed airports in Lublin and Rzeszow near the border with Ukraine for several hours during the Russian attacks, the country's armed forces command said on X. There was no violation of Polish airspace, it said. Civil aviation authority Pansa said the two airports had since resumed operations. It was unclear what caused the alert in Poland when the Russian attacks were focused on Kyiv, which is far from the border.",
      "Russia targeted Ukraine with almost 500 drones and 40 missiles of various types, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. The main target was energy and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv, he said. In some districts of the region there is no electricity or heating because of the attacks, he added.",
      "\"There have been many questions these days. Where is the Russian response to the proposals to end the war, which were made by the United States and the world?\" Zelenskyy said Saturday. \"Russian representatives hold long talks, in reality the 'Kinzal' and 'Shaheds' speak for them,\" he added, a reference to certain types of missiles and drones.",
      "\"His scream is still in my ears\"",
      "There were over 10 damaged residential buildings in the attack, said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, in a post on Telegram. People were being evacuated from under the rubble of collapsed buildings.",
      "Olena Karpenko, 52, heard a man as he burned to death in the attack. \"His scream is still in my ears. I can't believe it,\" she said, weeping.",
      "Karpenko said they heard a sudden explosion at the nearby thermal power plant, followed by a stronger blast that shook the windows of her home. Then came the hit on her building.",
      "\"I saw how the apartment was burning, there was a fire and we heard a man's screams, begging for help,\" she said.",
      "Two children were among those wounded in the attack, which hit seven locations across the capital, the head of the Kyiv Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko, in a statement on Telegram. A body was found under the rubble of one damaged building, he said.",
      "\"In fact, the entire center of Kyiv was under attack by drones,\" he said, adding that Russia was sending a message that \"it is raising the stakes in this war.\"",
      "A fire broke out in an 18-story residential building in the Dnipro district of the city, and emergency crews rushed to the scene to contain the flames. A 24-story residential building in the Darnytsia district was also hit, Tkachenko said, and more fires broke out in the Obolonskyi and Holosiivsky districts.",
      "In the wider Kyiv region, the strikes hit industrial and residential buildings, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. In the Vyshhorod area, emergency crews rescued one person found under the rubble of a destroyed house.",
      "Russia claims territorial gains",
      "In what could be viewed as an effort to further ramp up pressure on Ukraine before the Zelenskyy-Trump talks, the Kremlin on Saturday night released a video of Putin in military fatigues receiving reports from top military officials in an unidentified military command post.",
      "Russia's General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that the Russian troops have taken full control of Myrnohrad in the Donetsk region \u2014 Russia uses the old Soviet name of the city, Dimitrov \u2014 the city of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, and a few other settlements.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's General Staff reported attempts by Russian forces \"to push Ukrainian defenders from their positions\" in a number of areas, including Myrnohrad, and Kyiv's forces repelling \"enemy attempts to advance\" in the areas of Huliaipole and Bilohiria.",
      "Putin said that \"if Kyiv authorities are not willing to end the matter peacefully, we will achieve all the goals we have in the special military operation by military means.\"",
      "Zelenskyy travels to meet Trump",
      "According to the Agence France-Presse, while in Canada, Zelensky also held a conference call in which he briefed European Union, NATO and European leaders, who gave him their \"full support\" per German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.",
      "EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a social media post they welcomed \"a just and lasting peace that preserves Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"",
      "Carney announced $1.8 billion worth of economic assistance to Ukraine that helps unlock financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for reconstruction and development.",
      "In a series of social media posts Saturday evening, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is working with the U.S. on a recovery roadmap to 2040. He estimated that Ukraine will need \"somewhere around\" $700 billion to $800 billion \"for reconstruction.",
      "In one post, Zelenskyy made several requests to the U.S. and Europe, including air defenses and weaponry \u2014 which he said are \"currently insufficient\" \u2014 along with money and drones.",
      "Zelenskyy has said he would prioritize discussing security guarantees for Ukraine when he meets with Mr. Trump. The U.S. has committed to providing guarantees that mirror the NATO alliance's Article 5, which means an attack on Ukraine would trigger a collective military response from the U.S. and its allies. But key details need to be worked out.",
      "Territorial concessions are the most sensitive of issues\u00a0the two leaders will discuss, including the Donetsk region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would never recognize any territory as Russian \"under any circumstances.\"",
      "\"But the most important issue I want to stress today is security guarantees. Beyond territorial issues and the ZNPP (nuclear plant), security guarantees are critically important for us,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Thailand and Cambodia signed a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after weeks of deadly fighting along their border.",
    "story": [
      "Thailand and Cambodia signed a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after\u00a0weeks of deadly fighting\u00a0along their border over competing territorial claims.",
      "The neighbors' long-standing border conflict reignited this month, shattering an earlier truce and killing at least 47 people, according to official counts. Around one million people have also been displaced.",
      "The agreement took effect at noon local time and calls for a halt in military movements and airspace violation for military purposes.",
      "Only Thailand has carried out airstrikes, hitting sites in Cambodia as recently as Saturday morning, according to the Cambodian Defense Ministry.",
      "The deal also calls for Thailand, after the ceasefire has held for 72 hours, to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.",
      "Within hours of the signing, Thailand's Foreign Ministry protested to Cambodia that a Thai soldier sustained a permanent disability when he stepped on an anti-personnel land mine it charged had been laid by Cambodian forces.",
      "Defense ministers met at the border to sign the agreement",
      "The agreement was signed by the countries' defense ministers, Cambodia's Tea Seiha and Thailand's Nattaphon Narkphanit, at a border checkpoint. It followed three-day lower-level talks by military officials.",
      "It declares that the sides are committed to an earlier ceasefire that ended five days of fighting in July and follow-up agreements.",
      "The original July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended. Despite those deals, the countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued, escalating in early December to widespread heavy fighting.",
      "Many clauses similar to those in Saturday's agreement were included in October's ceasefire document, and were open to various interpretations and generally honored only in part. These included provisions concerning land mines and the Cambodian prisoners.",
      "The fragility of the new agreement was underlined by Thailand's Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri in a news briefing after Saturday's signing. He said that the safe return of civilians to their homes would indicate the situation had stabilized enough to allow the repatriation of the captured Cambodian soldiers.",
      "\"However if the ceasefire does not materialize, this would indicate a lack of sincerity on the Cambodian side to create sure peace,\" he said. \"Therefore, the 72-hour ceasefire beginning today is not an act of trust nor unconditional acceptance but a time frame to tangibly prove whether Cambodia can truly cease the use of weapons, provocations and threats in the area.\"",
      "Civilians bore the brunt of the fighting",
      "Thailand has lost 26 soldiers and one civilian as a direct result of the combat since Dec. 7, according to officials. Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths.",
      "Cambodia hasn't issued an official figure on military casualties, but says that 30 civilians have been killed and 90 injured. Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.",
      "\"Today's ceasefire also paves the way for the displaced people who are living in the border areas to be able to return to their homes, work in the fields, and even allow their children to be able to return to schools and resume their studies,\" Cambodia's Defense Minister Tea Seiha told reporters after the signing.",
      "Each side blamed the other for initiating the fighting and claimed to be acting in self-defense.",
      "The agreement also calls on both sides to adhere to international agreements against deploying land mines, a major concern of Thailand.",
      "Thai soldiers along the border have been wounded in at least 10 incidents this year by what Thailand says were newly planted Cambodian mines. Cambodia says the mines were left over from decades of civil war that ended in the late 1990s.",
      "Following the latest injury on Saturday, Thailand's Foreign Ministry noted that the new agreement \"includes key provisions on joint humanitarian demining operations to ensure the safety of military personnel and civilians in the border areas as soon as possible.\"",
      "Another clause says the two sides \"agree to refrain from disseminating false information or fake news.\"",
      "The agreement calls for a resumption of previous measures to demarcate the border. The sides also agreed to cooperate in suppressing transnational crimes. That's primarily a reference to\u00a0online scams perpetrated by organized crime that have bilked victims around the world of billions of dollars each year. Cambodia is a center for such criminal enterprises.",
      "World leaders hail the agreement",
      "Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was instrumental in putting together the original ceasefire, said the new agreement \"reflects a shared recognition that restraint is required, above all in the interest of civilians.\"",
      "The European Union also welcomed the agreement, and called on \"both sides to implement it in good faith.\" EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anouar El Anouni thanked the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which both Cambodia and Thailand are members, for \"playing a positive part in the result,\" in a social media post.",
      "\"The EU stands ready to provide any support needed,\" El Anouni said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that the United States welcomed the agreement and urged the two countries to \"immediately honor this commitment and fully implement the terms of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords.\"",
      "The office of United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he \"welcomes news that Thailand and Cambodia have resumed a ceasefire and hopes this will pave the way for confidence building and peace.\"",
      "\"Communities and migrants affected must receive all necessary assistance to return home safely,\" the office said on social media.",

    "summary": "Strikes against ISIS targets in Nigeria come after President Trump spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "\"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the strikes, such as how many people were killed, who or what was specifically targeted, or how many strikes were carried out, other than to say they were \"numerous perfect strikes.\"",
      "U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Africa, said in a statement that its \"initial assessment is that multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end. \"The @DeptofWar is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight \u2014 on Christmas. More to come\u2026 Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.\"",
      "The Defense Department posted to its X account\u00a0an unclassified 9-second video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.",
      ".@POTUS \u201cTonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ct7rUW128t",
      "In its own statement, Nigeria's foreign ministry acknowledged the strikes\u00a0and indicated that it was given advanced notice, saying that \"Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West.\"",
      "\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,\" the ministry added.",
      "Nigerian\u00a0 Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar went further, telling a local television network his nation provided the U.S. with intelligence on jihadists before the raids, French news agency AFP reported. It quoted him as saying he spoke by phone with Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"for 19 minutes before the strike and then we spoke again for another five minutes before it went on.\"",
      "Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: \"It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the U.S. We are working with other countries as well.\"",
      "In early November, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in Nigeria after he alleged that Nigeria's government was not doing enough to combat the persecution of Christians there.",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Nov. 1.",
      "In response at the time, Hegseth wrote on social media that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department, was \"preparing for action.\"",
      "This comes about a week after the U.S. conducted a series of strikes on ISIS targets in Syria in response to the killing of two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter.",
      "Mr. Trump in November also said he would be designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The Nigerian government has rejected Mr. Trump's claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. Analysts have said that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur. Earlier Thursday, at least five people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu previously said on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

      "An elusive wild cat long feared extinct in Thailand has been rediscovered three decades after the last recorded sighting, conservation authorities and an NGO said Friday.",
      "Flat-headed cats are among the world's most threatened wild felines, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimating that just 2,500 adults exist in the wild. The rare animals are about the size of a domestic cat and have distinctive, round, close-set eyes.",
      "Flat-headed cats are found only in Southeast Asia and typically live in dense wetland ecosystems like peat swamps and freshwater mangroves. Such areas are under threat: Thailand's peat swamp forests have been heavily fragmented, largely due to land conversion and agricultural expansion, said veterinarian and researcher Kaset Sutasha of Kasetsart University. The last confirmed sighting of a flat-headed cat in Thailand was in 1995.",
      "Last year, wild cat conservation organization Panthera and Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation began an ecological survey that used camera traps in the country's Princess Sirindhorn Wildlife Sanctuary.",
      "Flat-headed cats were detected 29 times during the survey, Panthera and Thai officials said. It was not immediately clear how many individuals the detections represent, as the species lacks distinctive markings, so counting is tricky. Pattanarangsan said the survey's findings suggest a relatively high concentration of the species.",
      "The footage included a female flat-headed cat with her cub \u2014 a rare and encouraging sign for a species that typically produces only one offspring at a time. The species has also struggled to reproduce across isolated areas, contributing to its endangerment.",
      "Kaset, who was not involved in the survey but has researched wild cats for years, said the \"rediscovery is exciting\" but is only a \"starting point\" for future conservation efforts.",
      "\"What comes after this is more important \u2014 how to enable them to live alongside us sustainably, without being threatened,\" Kaset said.",
      "In addition to Thailand, flat-headed cats can be found in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo, according to the Felidae Conservation Fund. They have a diet dominated by fish, frogs and shrimp, and are nocturnal, elusive animals.",
      "Much about the species remains a mystery because of their rarity and the difficulty of accessing their habitats, Panthera conservation program manager Rattapan Pattanarangsan said.",

      "Tehran, Iran \u2014 Iran seized a foreign oil tanker as it traveled the strategic Strait of Hormuz, state media said Friday.",
      "Mojtaba Ghahramani, a provincial chief of the justice department, said the oil tanker was carrying some 4 million liters (25,000 barrels) of smuggled fuel when the Revolutionary Guard naval forces seized the vessel, the official IRNA news agency reported.",
      "Ghahramani said the forces also detained 16 foreign crew members of the tanker, adding that the seizure was a remarkable \"blow \" to smugglers. He didn't disclose the nationality of the crew or the flag of the tanker.",
      "Iran occasionally seizes oil-carrying vessels over similar charges in the region. In November, Iran seized a ship as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over what it said were violations, including carrying an illegal consignment.",
      "The West has blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "Iran also seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",
      "Following years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, Iran saw a full-scale 12-day war in June with Israel, whose strikes led to the deaths of senior military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran's retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 in Israel.",
      "Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.",

There's two love songs that are maybe kind of hopeful, and then it ends real quick, and that is an accurate representation of how my love life recently went. So, yeah, I'm focused on the music and my career, and that's kind of all about all I have time for right now.\"",

      "\"I think, honestly, if you step back, it's a lot easier than you've ever thought it was. I always made things so difficult because I was always concerned about how something made me feel or how secure I felt. And I really made situations so much harder than they had to be.\"",

      "Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to give tips on staying physically and mentally healthy this holiday season.",
      "If the stress of the holidays wreaked havoc on your gut, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 76% of Americans experience gastrointestinal distress during the holiday season, according to a recent national survey from Oshi Health and YouGov.",
      "Digestive problems can be triggered not only by holiday overeating, but also by stress. Financial worries, disrupted routines, fatigue and interpersonal dynamics rank as some of the top causes.",
      "\"I see an uptick in psychiatry-related GI issues during the holiday season,\" Dr. Claire Brandon, a gastrointestinal psychiatrist based in New York City, told Fox News Digital. \"When you are undergoing stress, your body produces more corticotropin-releasing hormones, which sets off a cascade of the inflammatory system.\"",
      "GUT IMBALANCE MAY BE DRIVING AMERICA\u2019S FOOD ALLERGY EPIDEMIC, EXPERTS WARN",
      "Stress hormones can act directly on the gut, leading to more digestive distress and pushing the body out of \"rest-and-digest mode,\" Brandon said.",
      "\"Stress activates the sympathetic \u2014 fight, flight, freeze \u2014 nervous system, which slows digestion,\" added Dr. David Clarke, an Oregon-based gastroenterologist and president of the Association for the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms. \"That can lead to bloating, cramps, nausea and sometimes abdominal pain.\"",
      "Stress often plays a bigger role in digestive issues than overeating alone, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The good news, doctors say, is that a few simple, realistic steps can help reset the digestive system after the holidays.",
      "No. 1: Reset your sleep",
      "Sleep plays a major role in gut health. Research shows that insufficient or disrupted sleep can change the composition and function of the gut microbiome, potentially affecting metabolic and immune factors that influence overall health.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"When I travel and get derailed, my main focus is to reset my sleep,\" Brandon said. She recommends reestablishing wind-down routines like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.",
      "No. 2: Eat balanced, fiber-rich meals",
      "Fiber helps keep digestion moving and supports healthy gut bacteria, which can aid post-holiday recovery, experts say.",
      "\"The usual principles for supporting digestion apply here,\" said Clarke. \"Consuming a balanced diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes; avoiding highly processed foods; and moderating alcohol will keep your gut microbiome happy.\"",
      "Digestive symptoms like bloating and discomfort often spike during the holidays due to stress, travel and disrupted routines. (iStock)",
      "No. 3: Stay hydrated",
      "Staying hydrated will also aid digestion, Clarke said, noting that light-colored urine is a good indicator of hydration.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Traveling can be particularly tough on the gut, experts say, especially during flights where low cabin humidity causes the body to pull water from the bowels, leading to constipation.",
      "Drinking water before, during, and after flights \u2014 and limiting alcohol and caffeine \u2014 can help counteract dehydration-related digestive slowdowns. Experts also recommend sipping water consistently throughout the day.",
      "No. 4: Resume regular movement",
      "Both doctors agreed that exercise supports digestion and stress regulation, which are both key to gut recovery.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Going on walks can be enough to help with this, but if you have space to do more, including some gentle stretching, that can be a huge help,\" Brandon advised.",
      "No. 5: Reduce stress gradually",
      "Stress management plays a critical role in gut health, and experts say that small, consistent habits can help ease gastrointestinal symptoms.",
      "Brandon recommends calming the nervous system with breathing or grounding exercises and slowing down at meals.",
      "Light movement can help support digestion and regulate stress, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"If you\u2019re constantly running on fumes, on a layover in the airport, eating high sugar and doing things off your routine, expect a few disruptions with your gut,\" she said. \"Reframe it as something that you can reset when you get home.\"",
      "No. 6: Skip cleanses and detoxes",
      "Clarke says that detoxes and cleanses are not necessary and can actually be harmful. Instead, he recommends sticking to the basics \u2014 including hydration, balanced meals, regular sleep and movement.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Doctors say the gut is designed to recover on its own in response to consistently healthy practices rather than extreme resets.",
      "Experts recommend returning to balanced, fiber-rich meals instead of intense cleanses. (iStock)",

When it became clear the self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani would capture the party\u2019s nomination, Schumer tried to dodge questions about whether he would support his bid. That reluctance never went away and questions about the relationship between the two Democrats only intensified.",

      "\"The commandment is that you're not supposed to work on the Sabbath,\" Engelhardt said. \"And the idea is, the scripture says, in six days you shall labor, and on the seventh day you shall rest, because it is holy.

      "Pornhub is facing new fallout after hackers claimed to steal millions of user records tied to Premium accounts. The group is threatening to release sensitive activity data unless paid in Bitcoin. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What data ShinyHunters claims to have stolen",
      "ShinyHunters says the exposed data focuses on Pornhub Premium users. While no financial information was included, the dataset still contains highly sensitive activity details.",
      "The group claims the stolen records include:",
      "Email addressesActivity typeLocationVideo URLs and video namesKeywords linked to videosTimestamps showing when the activity occurred",
      "Email addresses",
      "Activity type",
      "Location",
      "Video URLs and video names",
      "Keywords linked to videos",
      "Timestamps showing when the activity occurred",
      "Activity logs reportedly show whether a user watched or downloaded a video or viewed a channel. Search histories are also included, which raises serious privacy concerns if the data is released publicly.",
      "How Mixpanel is connected to the breach",
      "The alleged breach appears linked to a separate November security incident involving Mixpanel, a data analytics vendor that previously worked with Pornhub. That earlier breach occurred after a\u00a0smishing attack gave threat actors access to Mixpanel systems. However, Mixpanel says it does not believe Pornhub data came from that incident. The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021. That means the stolen data would be several years old. Reuters contacted some Pornhub customers to verify the claims. Those users confirmed the data tied to their accounts was accurate but outdated, which aligns with the Mixpanel timeline.",
      "What Pornhub says was not exposed",
      "Pornhub moved quickly to reassure users following the reports. In a security notice, the company said:",
      "\"This was not a breach of Pornhub Premium's systems. Passwords, payment details and financial information remain secure and were not exposed.\"",
      "That distinction reduces the immediate risk of financial fraud. However, exposure of viewing habits and search activity still carries long-term privacy risks. We reached out to Pornhub for a comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Why ShinyHunters remains a serious threat",
      "ShinyHunters\u00a0has been linked to some of the most disruptive data breaches this year. The group relies heavily on social engineering tactics such as\u00a0phishing\u00a0and\u00a0smishing to gain access to corporate systems. Once inside, the group typically steals large datasets and uses extortion threats to pressure companies into paying ransoms. This strategy has affected businesses and users worldwide.",

      "Data breaches often lead to follow-up scams. Be cautious of emails, texts or phone calls that reference Pornhub or account issues. Avoid clicking links, downloading attachments or sharing personal information unless you can verify the source. Installing a strong antivirus program adds another layer of defense against malicious links and downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

If leaked data from this breach is shared, resold or cross-referenced with broker databases, removing your information can make it much harder for scammers to connect it to you.",
      "This step is especially important after high-profile breaches involving activity data. Shrinking what is publicly available about you reduces the risk of targeted phishing, impersonation and long-term privacy harm.",

      "A VPN helps protect your browsing activity by masking your IP address and encrypting your internet traffic. That is especially relevant in breaches like this one, where exposed activity data may include location signals or usage patterns. While a VPN cannot erase past exposure, it reduces how much new information is visible going forward and makes it harder to link future activity back to you. Using a VPN consistently can also limit tracking across sites, which helps lower your overall digital footprint after a breach.",

      "Apple has released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploited in highly targeted attacks.",
      "The company described the activity as an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" aimed at specific individuals. Although Apple did not identify the attackers or victims, the limited scope strongly suggests spyware-style operations rather than widespread cybercrime.",
      "Both flaws affect WebKit, the browser engine behind Safari and all browsers on iOS. As a result, the risk is significant. In some cases, simply visiting a malicious webpage may be enough to trigger an attack.",
      "Below, we break down what these vulnerabilities mean and explain how you can better protect yourself.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Apple released emergency updates after confirming two zero-day WebKit flaws were actively exploited in targeted attacks. (Reuters/Thomas Peter/File Photo)",
      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "What Apple says about the zero-day vulnerabilities",
      "The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174, and Apple confirmed that both were exploited in the same real-world attacks. According to Apple's security bulletin, the flaws were abused on versions of iOS released before iOS 26, and the attacks were limited to \"specific targeted individuals.\"",
      "CVE-2025-43529 is a WebKit use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a device processes maliciously crafted web content. To put it simply, it allows attackers to run their own code on a device by tricking the browser into mishandling memory. Apple credited Google's Threat Analysis Group with discovering this flaw, which is often a strong indicator of nation-state or commercial spyware activity.",
      "The second flaw, CVE-2025-14174, is also a WebKit issue, this time involving memory corruption. While Apple describes the impact as memory corruption rather than direct code execution, these types of bugs are often chained together with other vulnerabilities to fully compromise a device. Apple says this issue was discovered jointly by Apple and Google's Threat Analysis Group.",
      "In both cases, Apple acknowledged that it was aware of reports confirming active exploitation in the wild. That language is important because Apple typically reserves it for situations where attacks have already occurred, not just theoretical risks. The company says it addressed the bugs through improved memory management and better validation checks, without sharing deeper technical details that could help attackers replicate the exploits.",
      "Devices affected and signs of coordinated disclosure",
      "Apple has released patches across its supported operating systems, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Safari, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS.",
      "According to Apple's advisory, affected devices include iPhone 11 and newer models, multiple generations of iPad Pro, iPad Air from the third generation onward, the eighth-generation iPad and newer and the iPad mini starting with the fifth generation. This covers the vast majority of iPhones and iPads still in active use today.",
      "Apple has patched the flaws across its entire ecosystem. Fixes are available in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3, macOS Tahoe 26.2, tvOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2 and Safari 26.2. Because Apple requires all iOS browsers to use WebKit under the hood, the same underlying issue also affected Chrome on iOS.",
      "6 steps you can take to protect yourself from such vulnerabilities",
      "Here are six practical steps you can take to stay safe, especially in light of highly targeted zero-day attacks like this.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Because WebKit powers Safari and all iOS browsers, even a malicious webpage may be enough to put unpatched devices at risk. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "This sounds obvious, but it matters more than anything else. Zero-day attacks rely on people running outdated software. If Apple ships an emergency update, install it the same day if you can. Delaying updates is often the only window attackers need. If you tend to forget about updates, let your devices handle them for you. Enable automatic updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Safari. That way, you are protected even if you miss the news or are traveling.",
      "Most WebKit exploits start with malicious web content. Avoid tapping on random links sent over SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or email unless you are expecting them. If something feels off, open the site later by typing the address yourself.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you are a journalist, an activist or someone who deals with sensitive information, consider reducing your attack surface. Use Safari only, avoid unnecessary browser extensions, and limit how often you open links inside messaging apps.",
      "Apple's Lockdown Mode is designed specifically for targeted attacks. It restricts certain web technologies, blocks most message attachments, and limits attack vectors commonly used by spyware. It is not for everyone, but it exists for situations like this.",
      "Targeted attacks often start with profiling. The more personal data about you that is floating around online, the easier it is to pick you as a target. Removing data from broker sites and tightening social media privacy settings can lower your visibility.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Uber Eats uses four-wheeled robots to handle the final stretch of food delivery.",
      "DoorDash wants to help you decide where to eat, not just how your food arrives. The company has launched Zesty, a new artificial intelligence-powered social app built to make finding local restaurants faster and easier.",
      "Zesty is now in public testing in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, menus and social videos, the app lets you ask an AI chatbot for recommendations in plain language.",
      "Think of it as a digital concierge for food discovery.",

      "How Zesty works",
      "Once you open Zesty and sign in with your DoorDash account, the experience feels familiar and simple. You see nearby restaurants and a chat box where you can type exactly what you want. DoorDash says users can ask prompts like:",
      "The app blends AI search with social discovery, showing photos, comments and saved spots shared by other diners. \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that's good for introverts",
      "Brunch spots good for groups",
      "Romantic dinner with a vintage feel",
      "The AI then curates recommendations by pulling information from DoorDash data, Google Maps, TikTok, Reddit and other sources. According to DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang, the goal is to surface the best suggestions from across the web in one place. Each recommendation includes context such as ratings, social buzz and where the suggestion came from. DoorDash says the results do not imply sponsorships or paid placements.",
      "A social network built around food",
      "Zesty also adds a social layer. Users can post photos, leave comments, follow other diners and share saved spots with friends. If you find a restaurant that looks promising, you can bookmark it for later or send it to someone planning dinner with you. This makes Zesty feel less like a search engine and more like a food-focused social network. It is designed for people who enjoy discovering places through other people's experiences, not just star ratings. For DoorDash, this is a clear shift toward community-driven discovery.",
      "Why DoorDash built Zesty",
      "DoorDash wants to remove friction from the decision process. Instead of bouncing among Google, TikTok, Yelp and delivery apps, Zesty aims to bring everything together in a single guided experience. That approach also aligns with a broader trend. More people already use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to plan meals and trips. Zesty aims to offer that same convenience with a strong local and social focus.",
      "Zesty lets users ask for restaurant recommendations in natural language instead of scrolling through endless reviews and menus. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"At DoorDash, we're always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,\" a company spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We're piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. Zesty is now in public beta in San Francisco and New York, and we're excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.\"",
      "Of course, Zesty faces an uphill climb. Many users already rely on Google Maps or existing social apps to find restaurants. Some may not want to download another standalone app, even if it promises better recommendations. Still, Zesty could appeal to users who enjoy food discovery as a social activity. For them, a dedicated network built around local dining may feel more useful than generic search results. DoorDash appears willing to test that idea and see how users respond.\u00a0For now, the company is focused on getting people to use the app, learning what works, and fine-tuning its matching engine. Once that experience feels right, Zesty will expand to more cities.",
      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "Part of DoorDash's bigger expansion plan",
      "Zesty is not an isolated experiment. It fits into DoorDash's broader push beyond food delivery. Earlier this year, DoorDash rolled out features for in-person dining reservations and in-store rewards. The company also continues to invest heavily in automation and AI-driven logistics.",
      "We reported a few months ago on another major innovation from DoorDash: Dot, its fast new autonomous delivery robot. Dot is designed for short local trips and runs on an AI-powered delivery platform that decides whether an order should be handled by a Dasher, a robot or another method. Together, Zesty and Dot show how DoorDash is trying to own more of the local commerce experience, from discovery to delivery.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you enjoy trying new restaurants, Zesty could save you time and decision fatigue. Instead of reading dozens of reviews, you can ask for exactly what you want and get curated suggestions instantly. For casual diners, the app may feel unnecessary if Google already works fine. For food lovers who like sharing finds and following others with similar tastes, Zesty could become a useful daily tool. It also signals where local discovery may be heading. AI-driven recommendations paired with social proof could soon replace traditional review hunting.",

      "Zesty is now in beta in San Francisco and New York as DoorDash tests and refines its personalized matching experience. (iStock)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Zesty shows DoorDash experimenting with how people choose where to eat, not just how food gets delivered. By combining AI search with social sharing, the company is testing a more conversational and community-driven approach to local discovery. Whether Zesty becomes essential or stays niche will depend on how well it delivers meaningful recommendations. Still, it highlights DoorDash's growing ambition to shape more parts of our everyday local life.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Typing a web address directly into your browser feels harmless. In fact, it feels normal. But new research shows that a simple habit is now one of the riskiest things you can do online. A recent study from cybersecurity firm Infoblox reveals a troubling shift.",
      "Most parked domains now redirect visitors to scams, malware or fake security warnings. In many cases, this happens instantly. You do not have to click anything. That means a single typo can expose your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What are parked domains?",
      "Parked domains are unused or expired web addresses. Many exist because someone forgot to renew a domain. Others are deliberate misspellings of popular sites like Google, Netflix or YouTube. For years, these domains displayed harmless placeholder pages. They showed ads and links to monetize accidental traffic. While annoying, they rarely posed serious danger. That is no longer true. Infoblox found that more than 90 percent of visits to parked domains now lead to malicious content. This includes scareware, fake antivirus offers, phishing pages and malware downloads.",
      "A single mistyped web address can redirect you from a trusted site to a dangerous parked domain in seconds, Kurt Knutsson writes. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Why direct navigation has become so risky",
      "Direct navigation means typing a website address by hand instead of using a bookmark or search result. One missing letter can change everything. For example, mistyping gmail.com as gmai.com does not trigger an error. Instead, it can deliver your email straight to criminals. Infoblox found that some of these typo domains actively run mail servers to capture messages. Even worse, many of these domains form part of massive portfolios. One group tracked by Infoblox controlled nearly 3,000 lookalike domains associated with banks, tech companies and government services.",
      "Malicious parked domains often trigger fake security warnings or hidden redirects without requiring any clicks. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "How these domains decide whom to attack",
      "Not everyone sees the same thing when visiting a parked domain. That is intentional. Researchers discovered that parked pages often profile visitors in real time. They analyze IP address, device type, location, cookies and browsing behavior. Based on that data, the domain decides what you see next. Visitors using a VPN or non-residential connection often see harmless placeholder pages. Residential users on phones or home computers get redirected to scams or malware instead. This filtering helps attackers stay hidden while maximizing successful attacks.",
      "Why parked domain scams are increasing",
      "Several trends are fueling the problem. First, traffic from parked domains is often resold multiple times through affiliate networks. By the time it reaches a malicious advertiser, there is no direct relationship with the original parking company. Second, recent ad policy changes may have increased exposure. Google now requires advertisers to opt in before running ads on parked domains. While intended to improve safety, this shift may have pushed bad actors deeper into affiliate networks with weaker oversight. The result is a murky ecosystem where responsibility is difficult to trace.",
      "Even government domains are being targeted",
      "Infoblox also found typosquatting aimed at government services. In one case, a researcher accidentally visited ic3.org instead of ic3.gov while trying to report a crime. The result was a fake warning page claiming a cloud subscription had expired. That page could just as easily have delivered malware. This highlights how easy it is to fall into these traps, even when doing something important.",
      "A screenshot shows how mistyping the FBI\u2019s IC3 web address redirects users to an unrelated parked domain. (Infoblox)",
      "Ways to stay safe from parked domain traps",
      "You can reduce your risk with a few smart habits:",
      "Save banks, email providers and government portals. Avoid typing these addresses manually.",
      "Slow down when entering web addresses. One extra second can prevent a costly mistake.",
      "Strong antivirus software protects your device if a malicious page loads, blocking malware downloads, scripts and fake security pop-ups.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data brokers often fuel targeting by selling personal details. Removing your data can reduce exposure to personalized scam redirects.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has moved at an unusually fast pace in 2025. According to the company, it launched GPT-5 in August, followed by GPT-5.1 in November. Now, just weeks later, GPT-5.2 has launched with familiar claims of being the smartest and most capable ChatGPT yet.",
      "At first glance, the rapid rollout might seem surprising. But there's context behind it. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly called a \"code red\" inside the company, urging teams to move faster on improving ChatGPT. That push comes as competition heats up. Google recently released Gemini 3, which reportedly outperformed ChatGPT on several artificial intelligence benchmarks and delivered stronger image generation. At the same time, Anthropic's Claude continues to advance quickly.",
      "Against that backdrop, GPT-5.2 feels less like a routine upgrade and more like a strategic response. So what actually changed in GPT-5.2, and why does OpenAI say it matters?",

      "What exactly is GPT-5.2",
      "GPT-5.2 is the newest version in OpenAI's flagship 5-series of large language models. Like its predecessor, it includes two default variants. GPT-5.2 Instant is designed for everyday chatting and web searches. GPT-5.2 Thinking is meant for more complex tasks like long reasoning chains and multi-step problem solving. These two models are now the default for all ChatGPT users, including free users. They replace GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking entirely. If you are using ChatGPT today, you are already using GPT-5.2, whether you realize it or not.",
      "What OpenAI says GPT-5 brings to ChatGPT",
      "At the same time, OpenAI continues to position GPT-5 as \"expert intelligence for everyone.\" The company says GPT-5 delivers stronger performance across math, science, finance, law and other complex subjects. In OpenAI's view, ChatGPT now acts more like a team of on-demand experts than a basic chatbot. To support that claim, OpenAI points to practical examples. These include better coding help, more expressive writing support, clearer health-related explanations and improved safety and accuracy. The company showcases use cases such as generating app code, writing speeches, explaining medications and correcting mistakes in user-submitted images. In theory, GPT-5.2 builds on that same foundation. However, while OpenAI emphasizes deeper thinking and more reliable answers, those gains remain subtle for many everyday users.",
      "What new features does GPT-5.2 add?",
      "Here's the short answer. None. GPT-5.2 does not introduce new tools, interfaces, or headline features. Instead, OpenAI describes a series of behind-the-scenes improvements that supposedly make ChatGPT faster, smarter and more capable. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 performs better at:",

      "NEW US MILITARY GENAI TOOL \u2018CRITICAL FIRST STEP\u2019 IN FUTURE OF WARFARE, SAYS EXPERT",
      "Why testing chatbot improvements is tricky",
      "Evaluating chatbot upgrades is harder than it sounds. Responses can vary widely even when prompts stay the same. A model might excel at one task and struggle with a nearly identical one just moments later. On top of that, OpenAI's 5-series models already perform at or near the top of the field. When performance starts that high, meaningful gains become harder to detect. With that in mind, we tested GPT-5.2, and in most tests, it behaved almost identically to GPT-5.1.",
      "Why benchmarks don't tell the full story",
      "OpenAI's benchmarks show modest gains for GPT-5.2. That matters for researchers and developers working at scale. Still, even advanced users may struggle to see practical benefits. Other companies have delivered clearer upgrades. Google's Gemini Nano Banana Pro model shows obvious gains in AI image generation and editing. Those improvements are easy for anyone to test and verify. By contrast, GPT-5.2's changes feel abstract. They exist mostly on paper rather than in daily use.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you pay for ChatGPT, there's little downside to using GPT-5.2. It replaces GPT-5.1 in the model lineup and generally performs at least as well in everyday use. Free users don't have much choice either, as model access is handled automatically. For most people, the experience feels familiar and stable.",
      "The picture shifts slightly for programmers and those who use it for business. Early pricing details suggest GPT-5.2 may cost roughly 40 percent more per million tokens than GPT-5.1, depending on usage tier and access method. That makes testing important before committing at scale.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "GPT-5.2 feels like a model released under pressure rather than inspiration. It performs well, stays reliable, and moves forward in measurable ways. Still, it doesn't deliver the kind of clear progress many people expect from a new version number. OpenAI remains a leader in AI, but competition is closing in fast. As rivals roll out more noticeable improvements, small updates may no longer be enough to stand out. For now, GPT-5.2 feels less like a breakthrough and more like OpenAI holding its ground.",

      "Getting a brand-new iPhone should be a moment you enjoy. You open the box. You power it on. Everything feels secure. Unfortunately, scammers know that moment too.",
      "Over the past few weeks, we've heard from a number of people who received unexpected phone calls shortly after activating a new iPhone. The callers claimed to be from a major carrier. They said a shipping mistake was made. They insisted the phone needed to be returned right away. One message stood out because it shows exactly how convincing and aggressive this scam can be.",
      "\"Somebody called me (the call said it was from Spectrum) and told me they sent the wrong iPhone and needed to replace it. I was to rip off the label on the box, tape it up and set it on my porch steps. FedEx was going to pick it up and they'd put a label on it. And just for my trouble, he'd send me a $100 gift card! However, the guy was just too anxious. He called me again at 7 am to make sure I would follow his instructions. Right after that, I picked up my box on the steps and called Spectrum, who confirmed it was a scam. There are no such things as refurbished i17 phones because they're brand new. I called the guy back, said a few choice words and hung up on him. Since then, they have called at least twice for the same thing. Spectrum should be warning its customers!\"",
      "That second early morning call was the giveaway. Pressure is the scammer's favorite tool.",

      "Scammers often strike right after a new iPhone purchase, using urgency and fake carrier calls to catch you off guard before you have time to verify. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the new iPhone replacement scam works",
      "This scam relies on timing and pressure. First, criminals focus on people who recently bought a new iPhone. That information often comes from data-broker sites, leaked purchase data or marketing lists sold online. Next, scammers spoof a carrier phone number. As a result, the call appears legitimate. They sound confident and informed because they already know the device model you ordered.",
      "Once the call begins, the story moves quickly. The scammer claims a shipping mistake occurred. Then they insist the phone must be returned right away. To reinforce urgency, they say a courier is already scheduled. If you follow the instructions, you hand over a brand-new iPhone. At that point, the device is gone. The scammer either resells it or strips it for parts. By the time you realize something is wrong, recovery is unlikely.",
      "Why this scam feels so believable",
      "This scam copies real customer service processes. Carriers do ship replacement phones. FedEx does handle returns. Gift cards are often used as apologies. Scammers blend those facts together and add urgency. They count on you acting before you verify. They also rely on one risky assumption, that a phone call that looks real must be real.",

While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "summary": "Amazon Ring&apos;s new facial recognition feature sparks privacy controversy as Electronic Frontier Foundation critics argue the AI upgrade expands surveillance risks.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on Special Report.",
      "Amazon's Ring video doorbells are getting a major artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade, and it is already stirring controversy.",
      "The company has started rolling out a new feature called Familiar Faces to Ring owners across the United States. Once enabled, the feature uses AI-powered facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door. Instead of a generic alert saying a person is at your door, you might see something far more personal, like \"Mom at Front Door.\" On the surface, that sounds convenient.",
      "Privacy advocates, however, say this shift comes with real risks.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Ring\u2019s new Familiar Faces feature uses AI facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door and personalize alerts. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "How Ring's Familiar Faces feature works",
      "Ring says Familiar Faces helps you manage alerts by recognizing people you know. Here is how it works in practice. You can create a catalog of up to 50 faces. These may include family members, friends, neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff or other frequent visitors. After labeling a face in the Ring app, the camera will recognize that person as they approach. Anyone who regularly passes in front of your Ring camera can be labeled by the device owner if they choose to do so, even if that person is unaware they are being identified.",
      "From there, Ring sends personalized notifications tied to that face. You can also fine-tune alerts on a per-face basis, which means fewer pings for your own comings and goings. Importantly, the feature is not enabled by default. You must turn it on manually in the Ring app settings. Faces can be named directly from Event History or from the Familiar Faces library. You can edit names, merge duplicates or delete faces at any time.",
      "Amazon says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. Once a face is labeled, however, that data remains stored until the user deletes it.",
      "Why privacy groups are pushing back",
      "Despite Amazon's assurances, consumer protection groups and lawmakers are raising alarms. Ring has a long history of working with law enforcement. In the past, police and fire departments were able to request footage through the Ring Neighbors app. More recently, Amazon partnered with Flock, a company that makes AI-powered surveillance cameras widely used by police and federal agencies. Ring has also struggled with internal security. In 2023, the FTC fined Ring $5.8 million after finding that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customer videos for years. The Neighbors app previously exposed precise home locations, and Ring account credentials have repeatedly surfaced online. Because of these issues, critics argue that adding facial recognition expands the risk rather than reducing it.",
      "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff attorney Mario Trujillo tells CyberGuy, \"When you step in front of one of these cameras, your faceprint is taken and stored on Amazon\u2019s servers, whether you consent or not. Today\u2019s feature to recognize your friend at your front door can easily be repurposed tomorrow for mass surveillance. It is important for state regulators to investigate.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a well-known nonprofit organization that focuses on digital privacy, civil liberties and consumer rights in the tech space.",
      "WASHINGTON COURT SAYS FLOCK CAMERA IMAGES ARE PUBLIC RECORDS",
      "Once a face is labeled by the device owner, Ring can replace generic notifications with named alerts tied to that individual. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Where the feature is blocked and why that matters",
      "Legal pressure is already limiting where Familiar Faces can launch. According to the EFF, privacy laws are preventing Amazon from offering the feature in Illinois, Texas and Portland, Oregon. These jurisdictions have stricter biometric privacy protections, which suggests regulators see facial recognition in the home as a higher-risk technology. U.S. Senator Ed Markey has also called on Amazon to abandon the feature altogether, citing concerns about surveillance creep and biometric data misuse.",
      "Amazon says biometric data is processed in the cloud and not used to train AI models. The company also claims it cannot identify all locations where a face appears, even if law enforcement asks. Still, critics point out the similarity to Ring's Search Party feature, which already scans neighborhoods to locate lost pets.",
      "We reached out to Amazon for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Ring's other AI feature feels very different",
      "Not all of Ring's AI updates raise the same level of concern. Ring recently introduced Video Descriptions, a generative AI feature that summarizes motion activity in plain text. Instead of guessing what triggered an alert, you might see messages like \"A person is walking up the steps with a black dog\" or \"Two people are peering into a white car in the driveway.\"",
      "HOW RESTAURANT RESERVATION PLATFORM OPENTABLE TRACKS CUSTOMER DINING HABITS",
      "Ring\u2019s Video Descriptions feature takes a different approach by summarizing activity without identifying people by name. (Amazon)",
      "How Video Descriptions decides what matters",
      "This AI focuses on actions rather than identities. It helps you quickly decide whether an alert is urgent or routine. Over time, Ring says the system can recognize activity patterns around a home and only notify you when something unusual happens. However, as with any AI system, accuracy can vary depending on lighting, camera angle, distance and environmental conditions. Video Descriptions is currently rolling out in beta to Ring Home Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Unlike facial recognition, this feature improves clarity without naming or tracking specific people. That contrast matters.",
      "Video Descriptions turns motion alerts into short summaries, helping you understand what is happening without identifying who is involved. (Amazon)",
      "Should you turn Familiar Faces on?",
      "If you own a Ring doorbell, caution is wise. While Familiar Faces may reduce notification fatigue, labeling people by name creates a detailed record of who comes to your home and when. Given Ring's past security lapses and close ties with law enforcement, many privacy experts recommend keeping the feature disabled. If you do use it, avoid full names and remove faces you no longer need. In many cases, simply checking the live video feed is safer than relying on AI labels. Not every smart home feature needs to know who someone is.",
      "How to turn Familiar Faces on or off in the Ring app",
      "If you want to review or change this setting, you can do so at any time in the Ring mobile app.",
      "Open the Ring appTap the menu iconSelect Control CenterTap Video and Snapshot CaptureSelect Familiar FacesToggle the feature on and follow the on-screen prompts",

      "Turning the feature off stops facial recognition and prevents new faces from being identified. Any labeled faces can also be deleted manually from the Familiar Faces library if you want to remove stored data.",
      "Alexa is now answering your door for you",
      "Amazon is also rolling out a very different kind of AI feature for Ring doorbells, and it lives inside Alexa+. Called Greetings, this update gives Ring doorbells a conversational AI voice that can interact with people at your door when you are busy or not home. Instead of identifying who someone is, Greetings focuses on what they appear to be doing. Using Ring's video descriptions, the system looks at apparel, actions, and objects to decide how to respond.",
      "For example, if someone in a delivery uniform drops off a package, Alexa can tell them exactly where to leave it based on your instructions. You can even set preferences to guide delivery drivers toward a specific spot, or let them know water or snacks are available. If a delivery requires a signature, Alexa can ask the driver when they plan to return and pass that message along to you. The feature can also handle sales representatives or service vendors. You might set a rule such as politely declining sales pitches without ever coming to the door yourself.",
      "Greetings can also work for friends and family. If someone stops by while you are away, Alexa can greet them and ask them to leave a message for you. That interaction is saved so you can review it later. That said, the system is not perfect. Because it relies on visual context rather than identity, mistakes can happen. A friend who works in logistics could show up wearing a delivery uniform and be treated like a courier instead of being invited to leave a message. Amazon acknowledges that accuracy can vary. Importantly, Amazon says Greetings does not identify who a person is. It uses Ring's video descriptions to determine the main subject in front of the camera and generate responses, without naming or recognizing individuals. That makes it fundamentally different from the Familiar Faces feature, even though both rely on AI.",
      "Greetings is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen). It is available to Ring Premium Plan subscribers who have video descriptions enabled and is currently rolling out to Alexa+ Early Access users in the United States and Canada.",
      "Thinking about a Ring doorbell?",
      "If you are already in the Ring ecosystem or considering a video doorbell, Ring's lineup includes models with motion alerts, HD video, night vision, and optional AI-powered features such as Video Descriptions. While Familiar Faces remains controversial and can be turned off, many homeowners still use Ring doorbells for basic security awareness and package monitoring.",
      "If you decide Ring is right for your home, you can check out the latest Ring Video Doorbell models or compare features and pricing with other options by visiting Cyberguy.com and searching \"Top Video Doorbells.\"",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon Ring's AI facial recognition feature shows how quickly convenience can collide with privacy. Familiar Faces may offer smarter alerts, but it also expands surveillance into deeply personal spaces. Meanwhile, features like Video Descriptions prove that AI can be useful without identifying people. As smart home tech evolves, the real question is not what AI can do but what it should do.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new Android banking trojan called Sturnus is shaping up to be one of the most capable threats we have seen in a while. It is still in early development, but it already behaves like a fully mature operation.",
      "Once it infects a device, it can take over your screen, steal your banking credentials and even read encrypted chats from apps you trust. The worrying part is how quietly it works in the background. You think your messages are safe because they are end-to-end encrypted, but this malware simply waits for the phone to decrypt them before grabbing everything.",
      "It's important to note, however, that Sturnus does not break encryption; it only captures messages after your apps decrypt them on your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Sturnus malware uses deceptive screens that mimic real banking apps to steal your credentials in seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "A closer look at the malware's capabilities",
      "Sturnus combines several attack layers that give the operator nearly full visibility into the device, as reported by cybersecurity research firm ThreatFabric. It uses HTML overlays that mimic real banking apps to trick you into typing your credentials. Everything you enter goes straight to the attacker through a WebView that forwards the data instantly. It also runs an aggressive keylogging system through the Android Accessibility Service. This lets it capture text as you type, follow which app is open, and map every UI element on the screen. Even when apps block screenshots, the malware keeps tracking the UI tree in real time, which is enough to reconstruct what you are doing.",
      "NEW ANDROID MALWARE CAN EMPTY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN SECONDS",
      "On top of overlays and keylogging, the malware monitors WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and other messaging apps. It waits for these apps to decrypt messages locally, then captures the text right from the screen. This means your chats may remain encrypted over the network, but once the message appears on your display, Sturnus sees the entire conversation. It also includes a full remote control feature with live screen streaming and a more efficient mode that sends only interface data. This allows precise taps, text injection, scrolling and permission approvals without showing any activity to the victim.",
      "How Sturnus stays hidden and steals money",
      "The malware protects itself by grabbing Device Administrator privileges and blocking any attempt to remove it. If you open the settings page that could disable those permissions, Sturnus detects it immediately and moves you away from the screen before you can act. It also monitors battery state, SIM changes, developer mode, network conditions and even signs of forensic investigation to decide how to behave. All this data goes back to the command-and-control server through a mix of WebSocket and HTTP channels protected with RSA and AES encryption.",
      "When it comes to financial theft, the malware has several ways to take over your accounts. It can collect credentials through overlays, keylogging, UI-tree monitoring and direct text injection. If needed, it can black out your screen with a full-screen overlay while the attacker performs fraudulent transactions in the background. Since the screen is hidden, you have no idea anything is happening until it is too late.",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from Android malware like Sturnus",
      "If you want to protect yourself from threats like this, here are a few practical things you can start doing right away.",
      "Avoid downloading APKs from forwarded links, shady websites, Telegram groups or third-party app stores. Banking malware spreads most effectively through sideloaded installers disguised as updates, coupons or new features. If you need an app that isn't in the Play Store, verify the developer's official site, check hashes if provided and read recent reviews to make sure the app hasn't been hijacked.",
      "Most dangerous malware relies on accessibility permissions because they allow full visibility into your screen and interactions. Device administrator rights are even more powerful since they can block removal. If a simple utility app suddenly asks for these, stop immediately. These permissions should only be granted to apps that genuinely need them, such as password managers or accessibility tools you trust.",
      "Install system updates as soon as they arrive, since many Android banking trojans target older devices that lack the latest security patches. If your phone is no longer receiving updates, you are at a higher risk, especially when using financial apps. Avoid sideloading custom ROMs unless you know how they handle security patches and Google Play Protect.",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "The malware quietly captures decrypted messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal right as they appear on your screen. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Android phones come with Google Play Protect built in, which catches a large chunk of known malware families and warns you when apps behave suspiciously. But if you want greater security and control, choose a third-party antivirus app. These tools can alert you when an app starts logging your screen or trying to take over your phone.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "A lot of these campaigns rely on data brokers, leaked databases and scraped profiles to build lists of people to target. If your phone number, email, address or social handles are floating around on dozens of broker sites, it becomes much easier for attackers to reach you with malware links or tailored scams. A personal data removal service helps clean up that footprint by deleting your info from data broker listings.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

If the screen layout looks different or asks for credentials in a way you don't recognize, close the app completely. Reopen it from your app drawer and see if the prompt returns.

      "With remote control tools that stream your screen and automate taps, attackers can move money behind the scenes without you noticing. (Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Attackers frequently distribute malware through WhatsApp links, SMS messages and email attachments pretending to be invoices, refunds or delivery updates. If you receive a link you weren't expecting, open your browser manually and search for the service instead. Avoid installing anything that comes from a message, even if it appears to be from someone you know. Compromised accounts are a common delivery method.",
      "DATA BREACH EXPOSES 400,000 BANK CUSTOMERS\u2019 INFO",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Sturnus is still a young malware family, but it already stands out for how much control it gives attackers. It sidesteps encrypted messaging, steals banking credentials with multiple backup methods, and maintains a strong grip on the device through administrator privileges and constant environmental checks. Even if the current campaigns are limited, the level of sophistication here suggests a threat that is being refined for larger operations. If it reaches wide distribution, it could become one of the most damaging Android banking trojans in circulation.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:32:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Denmark&apos;s 3D-printed student village proves automation builds 36 apartments faster than traditional methods. Skovsporet project shows housing future.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "A quiet town in western Denmark is quickly becoming a testing ground for the future of housing.",
      "Skovsporet, described as Europe's largest 3D-printed housing project, is now taking shape in Holstebro. When finished, the development will deliver 36 student apartments built faster than many single-family homes.",
      "The project sits near VIA University College and serves students in the area. NordVestBo, an affordable housing organization focused on student living, commissioned the development. SAGA Space Architects designed the project in collaboration with 3DCP Group and COBOD. From the beginning, the goal stayed simple and ambitious. Build high-quality homes faster, more efficiently and at a scale traditional construction often struggles to reach. So far, the progress speaks for itself.",

      "AUSTRALIA DEBUTS FIRST MULTI-STORY 3D PRINTED HOME \u2013 BUILT IN JUST 5 MONTHS",
      "The six buildings are arranged around shared outdoor areas, creating a village-style layout designed for student life. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "How 36 student apartments were printed at record speed",
      "Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD3 3D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.",
      "At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.",
      "Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.",
      "Inside the 3D-printed student apartments",
      "Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Why 3D printed construction is changing how housing gets built",
      "The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.",
      "According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.",
      "How sustainability is built into this 3D printed housing project",
      "Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supports more sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.",
      "A COBOD BOD3 printer extrudes concrete layer-by-layer on site, forming the structural walls of Skovsporet\u2019s student apartments with millimeter precision. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "What happens next for Denmark's 3D-printed student housing",
      "The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.",
      "WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Skovsporet is more than a construction milestone. It is a real-world example of how digital design, automation and sustainability can come together at scale. As Europe, the United States and Australia explore similar projects, this student village in Denmark may become a blueprint for future neighborhoods.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips for safe holiday shopping and finding the best deals on Cyber Monday.",
      "Christmas is around the corner, and so is the SantaStealer malware. While the name sounds jolly, this malware is more than capable of ruining your happiness this festive season. The worst part is that this new strain is available to almost anyone willing to pay a small fee. It essentially works as malware-as-a-service, letting buyers target people at scale, obviously not for any legitimate use.",
      "SantaStealer is starting to make noise across Telegram channels and underground hacker forums. It is being marketed as a stealthy, memory-only information stealer that can quietly siphon data without leaving obvious traces on disk.",
      "Memory-only does not mean undetectable. It simply reduces disk artifacts, which can delay detection rather than prevent it altogether. That promise alone is enough to attract cybercriminals, especially at a time when browser-stored passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets remain high-value targets.",
      "MALICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSIONS HIT 4.3M USERS",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "SantaStealer malware is spreading ahead of Christmas, with cybercriminals marketing the data-stealing tool for hire across Telegram and underground forums. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SantaStealer and how it actually works",
      "SantaStealer operates as a malware-as-a-service, charging $175 per month for its basic tier and $300 per month for the premium plan. Researchers at Rapid7 say the operation rebrands an earlier project called BluelineStealer, with a Russian-speaking developer pushing toward a wider launch before the end of the year.",
      "Despite bold claims about evading detection, Rapid7's analysis paints a more grounded picture. The samples they examined were not particularly difficult to analyze and lacked the advanced anti-analysis techniques being advertised, which is good news for us. If it can be detected, security tools have a better chance of removing it before it can do serious damage.",
      "Functionally, SantaStealer is still dangerous. It uses 14 separate data-collection modules that run in parallel, pulling information from browsers, messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, gaming platforms such as Steam, crypto wallet apps and extensions, and even local documents. The malware can also take screenshots of your desktop. Stolen data is written to memory, compressed into ZIP files and sent out in 10MB chunks to a hardcoded command-and-control server.",
      "One notable capability is its use of an embedded executable to get around Chrome's App-Bound Encryption, a security feature introduced in mid-2024. This workaround typically requires the malware to be executed at the user level and is not a remote bypass of Chrome's security model. Similar tricks have already been used by other info-stealers, showing how quickly attackers test and adapt to new browser protections.",
      "What this says about the current threat landscape",
      "SantaStealer is not fully operational yet and has not been distributed at scale, but it reflects a broader trend in cybercrime. Modern info-stealers are modular, configurable and sold much like regular software. The affiliate panel that Rapid7 observed allows buyers to fine-tune exactly what data the malware steals, from full system sweeps to narrowly targeted attacks focused on specific apps or crypto wallets.",
      "The malware also includes options to avoid infecting systems in certain regions and to delay execution, which can throw off both victims and security analysts. As for how SantaStealer might spread, researchers say recent campaigns increasingly rely on ClickFix-style attacks. These tricks push victims into pasting malicious commands directly into the Windows terminal, often disguised as steps to fix an issue or enable a feature.",
      "More traditional methods are still very much in play. Phishing emails, pirated software, torrent downloads, malicious ads and even deceptive YouTube comments remain effective delivery channels. Once malware like this runs on a system, it needs very little time to grab saved passwords, session cookies and wallet data that can later be abused or sold.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from SantaStealer malware",
      "A few sensible habits and the right tools can significantly reduce your risk, even if malware like this continues to evolve. Here are seven practical steps you can take to stay safe:",
      "Modern antivirus tools don't just look for known malware signatures. They also monitor suspicious behavior, such as programs trying to grab browser data or run hidden processes. Keep real-time protection enabled and take alerts seriously instead of dismissing them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Updates are not just about new features. They often patch security flaws that malware actively targets. This includes your OS, browser, browser extensions, crypto wallet apps and messaging tools. Delaying updates gives attackers a wider window to exploit known weaknesses.",
      "Info-stealers love browser-saved passwords because they are easy to grab. A password manager stores your credentials in an encrypted vault and reduces what your browser keeps locally. It also helps you use strong, unique passwords for every service without having to remember them.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Even if your password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from getting in. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes and should be your first choice for email, crypto exchanges, cloud services and social media accounts.",
      "ClickFix-style attacks rely on trust and urgency. If a website, pop-up or video tells you to paste a command into the Windows terminal to fix something, stop. Unless you fully understand what that command does, assume it is dangerous.",
      "When your email, phone number or other personal details are widely available online, attackers can target you more convincingly. Personal data removal services help take your information down from data broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted phishing or malware lures.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Stick to official app stores, trusted developers and verified extensions, even if it means skipping a \"free\" download.",
      "SantaStealer can quietly siphon sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SantaStealer may not yet live up to its own hype, but that should not make you complacent. Early-stage malware often improves quickly once developers patch obvious mistakes. Be cautious with links and attachments from unfamiliar emails, and think twice before running unverified code or browser extensions pulled from public repositories.",

But she was still broadly supportive of the president in the June focus group with swing-state Latino voters who backed Trump.",
      "\u201cI think he has a grand master plan that most of us probably don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI have faith that he, a hundred percent, has the best interest of our country at heart.\u201d",
      "Fewer than half of Trump voters across the four focus groups said they felt that Trump had made fighting inflation a top priority, though some were still willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt or said they were seeing signs things had improved.",
      "\u201cI expected him to be aggressive in a lot of different areas and he\u2019s doing exactly that \u2014 being aggressive in a lot of different areas of focus that concern the U.S. citizens. Every few days you\u2019re hearing something different and you\u2019re constantly seeing him at work, working, getting stuff done,\u201d said 56-year-old independent Dorris S., who participated in the March group of swing-state Black Trump voters.",
      "But a number of others were less charitable on Trump\u2019s inflation efforts, particularly toward the end of the year.",
      "Robert L., a 54-year-old Virginian who participated in a December group of Trump voters who backed a Democrat for governor in November elections, said that the president\u2019s comments about inflation improving are \u201cdelusional\u201d and prove he\u2019s \u201cout of touch.\u201d",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Another participant in that same December panel, 39-year-old Virginian Justin K., said that he doesn\u2019t think Trump \u201ctried at all\u201d to tackle inflation because he was focused on other things.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been focused on prosecuting his political enemies, pardoning people,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even think that there\u2019s much a president can do on inflation, but I think that this was a kind of situation where he just said it to get elected,\u201d Justin continued.",
      "Rich Thau of Engagious, who moderated the sessions, told NBC News that from the focus groups, \"it\u2019s clear President Trump\u2019s greatest vulnerability is being viewed as ineffective and insulated when it comes to inflation\u2014just like President Biden was.\"",
      "Tariffs divide theory versus practice",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff policy also revealed an important divide, between those who were hopeful that a short stretch of instability would pay future dividends and others concerned about uncertainty or hurting businesses and consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s ridiculous that we haven\u2019t been charging tariffs for decades and we\u2019re starting to equalize it,\u201d Hector L., a 55-year-old North Carolina voter who was born in Puerto Rico, said in June.",
      "\u201cOther countries charge us particular tariffs for our goods; it\u2019s only fair that we make it equal across the playing board \u2014 no imbalance, that\u2019s been the problem. And he\u2019s trying to bring balance, to the force, per se, of tariffs,\u201d William A., a 60-year-old Georgia voter of Puerto Rican descent, said during the June panel.",
      "But David S., a 47-year-old New Jersey Trump voter who cast his ballot for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill last month, put it differently in December.",
      "\u201cTariffs are a tax on the American people. That\u2019s who pays for it, so I don\u2019t support it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery tariff that is put in place, from when Biden is putting \u2018em in place, Trump putting them in place, they are taxes on the people who are importing. The people who are buying those imports are paying the tax.\u201d",
      "Overall, some were optimistic about the economic outlook under Trump. And one of the things that brought out this sentiment most was considering a hypothetical under a Democratic administration.",
      "\u201cI feel that if we were in the hands of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, that our country would be doing a lot worse than it already was. I feel like Trump has amended some of those wrongs that were done,\u201d Harmony D., a 26-year-old Michigander who identifies as an independent and voted for Trump twice, said in October.",
      "But others see Trump\u2019s populist economic pitch falling short in practice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there\u2019s no consequences,\u201d Virginia\u2019s Justin K. said.",
      "High marks on immigration, but deportation concerns",
      "Immigration was a major piece of Trump\u2019s promise during the 2024 campaign, and most Trump voters were supportive of his measures to clamp down on illegal border crossings.",
      "But the focus groups also highlighted significant criticisms of the administration\u2019s deportation policies, with voters believing Trump wasn\u2019t properly prioritizing the removal of violent criminals over the removal of undocumented immigrants who posed little public safety threat. Some Trump voters directly panned the deportation policies as inhumane.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to immigration, a lot of respondents told us this year, \u2018I like what the President is doing, but I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s doing it.\u2019 This suggests they\u2019re struggling to reconcile their vote for the President with executive actions they find troubling,\u201d said Rich Thau of Engagious.",
      "Rebecca H., a 52-year-old independent from Virginia, said in December that she approves of how Trump is \"tightening the border control\" and \"restricting the refugees.\" But she didn't like how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was \"kidnapping people,\" she said, as it makes arrests.",
      "Katelyn R., a 21-year-old Wisconsin independent who participated in the October focus group of young Trump voters, invoked \u201cpro-life\u201d values to question the morality of the deportation policies.",
      "\u201cThe way that these people are being treated don\u2019t align with my Christian values, or my pro-life values, or any of the values that a conservative may have,\u201d she said.",
      "And Ruby L., a 59-year-old Georgia voter who was born in Colombia and participated in the Hispanic focus group in June, questioned the administration\u2019s priorities on the issue.",
      "\u201cHe was going to deport people that were criminals and have backgrounds,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I see that he\u2019s deporting people that work hard and have been in this country. I think he should find a way to help them stay and get citizenship or something.\u201d",
      "Others were less forgiving of those in America illegally, arguing that they knew the risks when they or their families came to the country.",
      "\u201cWell, what do you expect? If you came here illegally, you\u2019ve done something illegal. Expect the consequences,\u201d Justin O., a 38-year-old Nevadan who was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent, said during the June group."

    "story": [
      "When the television production company Jeff Nimoy worked for began falling behind on payroll in 2017, the Los Angeles showrunner wasn\u2019t alarmed.",
      "Bellum Entertainment was a \u201cmachine,\u201d he said, producing a steady slate of true crime shows, children\u2019s TV and documentaries. At one point, the company had upward of 30 shows on air or in development, including \u201cIt Takes a Killer.\u201d",
      "Like his colleagues, Nimoy also believed the company\u2019s CEO, Mary Carole McDonnell, was a wealthy aviation heiress with access to millions of dollars.",
      "\u201cI was like, there\u2019s no way this thing\u2019s going down, they\u2019ve got too much capital,\u201d said Nimoy, who believed at one point that he would spend the next 20 years of his career at Bellum.",
      "But that dream vanished when his paychecks stopped and Bellum Entertainment abruptly shut down. Nearly a decade later, Nimoy is still waiting to be paid over $16,000 \u2014 and McDonnell is a fugitive sought by the FBI after, it says, she falsely posed as the heir to the McDonnell aircraft family to defraud California banks out of nearly $30 million total.",
      "\u201cEverybody was right, and I was wrong,\u201d Nimoy said.",
      "This month, the FBI released a most-wanted bulletin seeking information about McDonnell, 73, who was federally indicted in 2018 on charges of bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Investigators allege that from July 2017 to May 2018, McDonnell used forged documents and claimed she had access to a secret $80 million trust fund as part of her scheme.",
      "Federal investigators believe McDonnell is in Dubai.",
      "While McDonnell faces criminal charges that she duped banks, former Bellum employees, family members and court records describe what they say was her fall from being a prolific television producer to an alleged con artist who left a long trail of victims.",
      "\u201cWe have been seeking her whereabouts,\u201d FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller told NBC News, noting that new information about allegations of continued misdeeds abroad has prompted the FBI to ask the public for help.",
      "The McDonnell aircraft family eventually sold the corporation. The James S. McDonnell Foundation didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "An alleged false legacy",
      "The only biographical detail in McDonnell\u2019s aviation dynasty story that a relative knew to be accurate was her ties to St. Louis. The relative asked not to be identified to protect other family members.",
      "McDonnell was born in Michigan and has ties to Alabama, the FBI said. But the relative said McDonnell grew up in the St. Louis area, where the McDonnell Douglas aircraft company was founded.",
      "The relative said that while McDonnell\u2019s father was \u201cwell off\u201d and owned a successful grocery store, she would \u201cinflate her value\u201d and make up stories about being connected to McDonnell Douglas Corp. The company was known for producing airplane parts during World War II, developing the Navy\u2019s first carrier-based jet fighter and shaping space exploration and aviation.",
      "\u201cI talked directly with her dad ... and he laughed and said, \u2018No, there\u2019s no connection there,\u2019\u201d the relative said. \u201cI was silly enough not to challenge her on that. But she would continue to tout that connection, adamant that she would inherit this huge sum of money.\u201d",
      "Details of McDonnell\u2019s early career and when she relocated to California aren\u2019t immediately clear. According to former Bellum Entertainment employees, McDonnell continued to claim she was a dynasty scion.",
      "\u2018I had a lot of bounced checks,\u2019 ex-Bellum worker says",
      "Brian Testa was hired as a producer and director for Bellum Entertainment\u2019s Burbank location in July 2016. He initially saw the opportunity to work on true crime re-enactment shows like \u201cMurderous Affairs\u201d and \u201cDeep Undercover\u201d as a new adventure.",
      "\u201cI came from a lot of reality [television]. So scripted, while keeping the story true to the person who was the victim, usually it was murder, I would tell that story as visually entertaining as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a challenge.\u201d",
      "Testa said his crew often worked 12-hour days scouting locations, filming and getting the props needed for shows. McDonnell was always in and out of the office, he said.",
      "Testa said McDonnell projected wealth \u2014 driving a Porsche, working out of an office with \u201crich wood everywhere\u201d and carrying herself like someone who would enjoy \u201cfive-star hotels and definitely the lavish lifestyle.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe dressed nice ... but always seemed slightly disheveled,\u201d he said, adding that the office rumors suggested she came from money.  \u201cI definitely heard two different stories while I was there. One was the McDonnell Douglas heiress, and then the other was that there was a family trust set up for her.\u201d",
      "When the checks started bouncing and the facade of generational wealth began to crumble, Testa said, McDonnell always had an explanation for the late payments. Sometimes she would blame them on a line of credit that didn\u2019t come through, and other times she\u2019d tell her employees that there was \u201csignificant bank fraud\u201d affecting company finances, Testa said.",
      "When people did get paid, Testa said, there was a rush to cash the checks.",
      "\u201cThere would be a mad dash out the door to get them to the banks before the banks would close so you could cash them, because they would move money around,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a lot of bounced checks.\u201d",
      "For Carlos Franco, doubts about Bellum Entertainment began almost as soon as he was hired as a production assistant at the company\u2019s New Orleans office in 2016.",
      "He began hearing complaints from his colleagues about not being paid while he was working on \u201cMurderous Affairs.\u201d Then, his first paycheck was late, and the excuses started.",
      "\u201cIt was always some issue with the bank or the money that they were supposed to be getting wasn\u2019t released to them yet, or they had to change banks, or they were getting a loan,\u201d he said.",
      "Unaware of the payroll issues alleged to be plaguing Bellum, Aaron Cadieux began working for the company in 2017 after having been contacted to help with a show, \u201cMysteries of the Unexplained.\u201d",
      "The production company wanted Cadieux as its director of photography for an episode filming in Massachusetts about the Bridgewater Triangle, a roughly 200-square-mile area in the state known for what some people believe is paranormal activity.",
      "Cadieux, who lives in Massachusetts and owns a video production company, had never heard of Bellum \u2014 but he jumped at the opportunity. The company paid him $500 upfront, which he said gave him \u201csome peace of mind\u201d and even provided him with a camera.",
      "\u201cI think they even provided lunch and all that kind of stuff. I mean, it was a skeleton operation. It wasn\u2019t like some huge-budget thing, but I was completely at ease,\u201d he said.",
      "Like the others, Cadieux said he began quickly noticing red flags. While the two-day shoot wrapped in the spring of 2017, he said, he was still waiting to be paid his remaining $2,000 invoice by the end of the summer.",
      "Cadieux said he sent emails and called Bellum for months for updates on his payment.",
      "\u201cI apologize for the delays in payment. We have fallen a bit behind. A payment is being processed and will be sent out this week,\u201d a Bellum employee who worked in accounts payable said in a July 26, 2017, email that Cadieux shared with NBC News.",
      "Cadieux said he never received the July payment. In a Nov. 10, 2017, email, the employee suggested that Cadieux\u2019s check had been mailed and apologized for the delay. When Cadieux once again didn\u2019t receive his money, he told NBC News, he eventually emailed McDonnell and threatened to create a website exposing her for not paying employees.",
      "\u201cThey wired me my money. I got paid, but what about the rest of these people? So I said screw it,\u201d he said, noting that he only briefly launched the website.",
      "Around the same time, Bellum\u2019s troubles began to make headlines, and the company was eventually slapped with dozens of wage claims lawsuits in Los Angeles County. Online court records show that McDonnell has been named in numerous civil cases.",
      "In 2017, the California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office investigated Bellum after roughly 50 employees filed unpaid wage claims, the entertainment site Deadline reported at the time.",
      "\u201cThe claims mostly allege non-payment of wages and have been filed by actors, producers, crew members, and others,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office told Deadline at the time. \u201cSome have settled, and some have not and are in different stages of the wage claim process.\u201d",
      "The Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office didn\u2019t immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment but said it was working to obtain information about its investigation of McDonnell.",
      "Facing mounting pressure, the company abruptly shut down after a planned weeklong break to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe night before we were supposed to return, it was something like, we\u2019re experiencing some delays, we\u2019re going to extend the break two more weeks,\u201d Nimoy said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I called my boss and said, \u2018We\u2019re never coming back.\u2019 He agreed, and we never heard from them again.\u201d",
      "Testa said that after the company closed, he began protesting outside the office to demand back pay. Days later, he received a check for the $3,000 he said the company owed him.",
      "But other Bellum workers weren\u2019t so lucky.",
      "Franco filed a complaint with the California Labor Department in September 2017 and won a judgment of $12,395 \u2014 but he says he is still owed $1,250 in unpaid wages. Nimoy said the company owes him $16,650 in back pay.",
      "From allegedly stiffing employees to allegedly swindling banks",
      "The FBI alleged that behind the scenes, McDonnell was running an even bigger con. A 2018 federal indictment accused her of obtaining $14.7 million from Banc of California by falsely claiming she was related to the McDonnell Douglas family and had access to an $80 million trust.",
      "In an amended federal civil complaint filed in December 2018, the bank said that during a meeting with McDonnell and her former lawyer, Barry Rothman, McDonnell said she was the heir to the founder of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the beneficiary of the family trust. McDonnell said she was set to receive a cash distribution from the trust but needed a loan to tide her over, the complaint alleges.",
      "The bank alleged that the scheme involved her forging documents and falsely claiming that she would repay the loan from the trust. The bank sued her for intentional misrepresentation/fraud, conspiracy to defraud and breach of written contract. Rothman, who died in March 2018, wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the case.",
      "Federal investigators alleged in an indictment that McDonnell used similar tactics to defraud more than $15 million from other financial institutions.",
      "On Dec. 12, 2018, a federal arrest warrant was issued for McDonnell on charges of aggravated identity theft and bank fraud. But by then, federal authorities believe, she had fled to Dubai.",
      "The FBI said it has received information that McDonnell is still alleged to be engaged in fraud abroad.",
      "\u201cPublicity is an investigative tool,\u201d said Eimiller, the FBI spokesperson. \u201cWe were at the point where the case was kind of cold, and we were receiving information that she was continuing to defraud, and we decided that it was the strategic time to go public.\u201d"

      "The man suspected of placing pipe bombs near the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican parties in 2021 felt \u201cextreme acts of violence\u201d were justified because \u201cthey were in charge,\u201d federal prosecutors said Sunday.",
      "In a request filed Sunday to keep him behind bars while he awaits trial, the Justice Department unveiled new allegations about the potential motive and actions of defendant Brian Cole, accused of planting the bombs on Jan. 5, 2021.",
      "Cole, 30, who lives with his mother and other family members in Virginia about 25 miles southwest of Capitol Hill, was arrested Dec. 4 and charged with transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials, according to charging documents.",
      "Cole has yet to enter pleas. His lead defense counsel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.",
      "Sunday's court filing alleges Cole had animosity for both political parties at a time when, he told investigators, he was \"watching everything, just everything getting worse.\"",
      "The filing said he made the statements to FBI agents who interviewed him at the bureau's Washington field office after his arrest. The request filed Sunday was written by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Jones.",
      "NBC News, citing three sources familiar with the matter, previously reported that Cole confessed to having planted the pipe bombs in an interview with FBI agents. Two sources familiar with the matter also previously told NBC News that Cole believed in conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.",
      "In Sunday's filing, prosecutors alleged that Cole told agents that if people thought \"something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with ... then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? Someone up top.\"",
      "The \"people up top\" included public figures \"on both sides\" who should not ignore people's grievances or call them \u201cconspiracy theorists,\u201d \u201cbad people,\u201d \u201cNazis\u201d or \u201cfascists,\" according to the filing.",
      "\"If people feel that their votes are like just being thrown away, then ... at the very least someone should address it,\" Cole was quoted as saying.",
      "Jones wrote that Cole said he did not like either party and that \"something just snapped\" after he had watched \"everything getting worse.\" He directed his ire at the Democratic and Republican parties because \"they were in charge,\" Cole told agents, according to the filing.",
      "The filing said that although the pipe bombs were planted on the eve of the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol, during which supporters of President Donald Trump sought to thwart certification of President Joe Biden's 2020 victory, the events were not related.",
      "\"The defendant denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to the proceedings scheduled to take place on January 6,\" Jones wrote.",
      "Prosecutors said Cole had purchased some of the items needed for the pipe bombs from 2018 to 2020. He was alleged to have been inspired to use pipe bombs by his interest in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, according to the filing, in which sectarian violence erupted for three decades and included bomb attacks.",
      "\"According to the defendant, he was not really thinking about how people would react when the bombs detonated, although he hoped there would be news about it,\" the filing said. \"The defendant stated that he had not tested the devices before planting them.\"",
      "Cole drove to D.C. from his home and kept the bombs, which he assembled just hours before and wiped off with disinfectant wipes, in a shoe box, prosecutors alleged in the filing. He set the devices to detonate in one hour, prosecutors said, but they did not for reasons not made clear.",
      "Sunday\u2019s filing said Cole was \u201cpretty relieved\u201d when he learned the bombs did not go off because he did not want to kill people.",
      "Prosecutors said Cole discarded all bomb-making materials at a dump after he saw himself on the news. Components for the bombs, prosecutors wrote, included a pipe nipple, end caps, wires, a 9-volt battery and homemade black powder, among other items.",
      "Cole said he did not tell anyone about the pipe bombs in the years since, the filing said. Agents searching his home this month found pipe nipples, iron end caps, wire and wire strippers. Agents also were said to have found a receipt for hand sanitizer and pipe nipples in Cole\u2019s car, as well as a shopping bag containing end caps and a 9-volt battery.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it was luck, not lack of effort, that the defendant failed to detonate one or both of his devices and that no one was killed or maimed due to his actions,\u201d Jones wrote in the filing. \u201cIndeed, the defendant admitted that he set both devices to detonate 60 minutes after he placed them.\"",
      "In the filing, Jones noted that first responders, party leaders and \"the Vice President-elect and Speaker of the House\" drove by the pipe bombs before they were discovered.",
      "\"His failure to accomplish his objectives does not mitigate the profoundly dangerous nature of his crimes,\" Jones wrote."

After making it clear that he is gay, his friends and family proudly support him and tell him they will always be by his side.",

I thought it was just going to be me and Joyce, and that\u2019s already nerve-wracking,\u201d Schnapp says. \u201cSo to have everyone standing there watching was really nerve-wracking in a lot of different ways.\u201d",

Who are they going to write it to? Obviously in the back of your head you know the impact it\u2019s going to have on a lot of people in the real world struggling with similar issues of their own self identity.\u201d",

His own power is the power that we all have, the power of accepting yourself and believing in yourself.\u201d",

      "In his videos from the evening, the crowd cheers during the last scene as if they were experiencing a live sporting event. Other reactions flooding social media are similarly euphoric, with people saying they're watching it \"like it's the Super Bowl.\"",
      "But why has Episode 5 in particular led to such an outpouring of love? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What Is \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019?",
      "Based on Rachel Reid\u2019s \"Game Changers\" romance novel series, two hockey all-stars fall for each other in \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "Situated within a league that has no openly queer players, Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) feel trapped, especially as their feelings for each other grow.",

      "What Happens in Episode 5 of 'Heated Rivalry'?",
      "Episode 5 continues the dramatic highs and lows of Shane and Ilya. Notable moments include Shane ending his relationship with Rose Landry, Shane getting hurt and taken off the ice on a stretcher with a distraught Ilya looking on, and Ilya confessing he loves Shane (that is, in Russian, a monologue that \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d fans who are native Russian speakers are especially loving.)",
      "But in its final few moments, after four episodes of angst, there's a reprieve, one that fans experienced with joy \u2014\u00a0and documented for social media.",
      "To explain it, we have to go back to Episode 3, which took a detour from Shane and Ilya\u2019s story to focus on another hockey player, New York star Scott Hunter (Francois Arnaud).",
      "While he\u2019s older than Shane and Ilya, who are both in their mid-20s, he's struggling with the same issue. His meet-cute with an aspiring art historian named Kip (Robbie G.K.) led to a real love, but he feels unable to come out. With Kip tired of living under the shadow of a secret romance, they're at a standstill.",
      "Then comes the ending of Episode 5, when Scott\u2019s New York Admirals win the Stanley Cup. As his teammates embrace friends and family on the ice, Scott moves to the edge of the rink and scans the crowd, looking for someone.",
      "Shane and Ilya watch the moment unfold on the TV. That means the fictional characters and the \"Heated Rivalry\" audience experience the shock of what Scott does next: He gestures for Kip to come down to the ice. Then, he kisses him on live TV.",
      "Meanwhile, Shane and Ilya seemingly have their own revelations of what this might mean for their relationship.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ilya calls Shane and takes him up on his offer to spend two weeks alone at his home. For the first time in years, they'll have quality together.",
      "The episode ends with Ilya telling Shane, \u201cI\u2019m coming to the cottage.\u201d",
      "Why Is Episode 5 Such a Big Deal?",
      "While \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has been building momentum since its premiere, Episode 5 has inspired a particular outpouring of emotion.",
      "Ronald Charles Chavis filmed his husband, Refeal Shtivi, weeping after watching the episode in a video shared to TikTok. Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple say the episode\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture\u201d reminded them of their own story. Shtivi was encouraged to come out to the wider world after meeting Chavis in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis coming out part in front of so many people, I did myself. I felt like the big release they were having. I felt super connected with that,\u201d Shtivi says.",
      "\u201cGay, straight \u2014 people want to know that they\u2019re loved,\u201d Chavis adds. \u201cThat was the beauty in that episode.\"",
      "Chavis calls the episode \u201ccathartic\u201d for viewers, especially after the four episodes of build-up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a such a release for them that everybody watching that episode felt it. Because at one point it felt like we were all holding our breath, waiting, and when he did that, it was like it was a sign that everything was going to be OK,\u201d Chavis says.",
      "Dominic points to the widespread pop culture phenomenon of  LGTBQ love stories ending in tragedy. Instead, at the end of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d Episode 5, a gay love story is \u201cloudly celebrated\" as the crowd in the stadium cheers, too.",
      "\u201cWhat was so great about it is that we finally got a huge happily ever after,\u201d Dominic says. \u201cWhen I watched it by myself, I was sobbing, because it\u2019s like we are constantly fighting for our happily ever after.\u201d",
      "For Dominic, Episode 5\u2019s ending is meta, with consequences reverberating both in the show and in the real world.",
      "\u201cI think seeing Scott choose Kip and bringing him on the ice was so triumphant, because sometimes that just never happens either in real life or in media portraits of gays in their relationship,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will be inspired to live the truth that they\u2019ve always wanted to,\" he said. \"If this is what\u2019s happening right now mainstream media, I\u2019m like, why can\u2019t it happen in real life?\u201d"

      "Back in October, James posted seven TikTok videos assigning people to groups one through seven, with her her single \u201cSo Unfair\" playing in the background.",
      "Thanks to the mystery of the algorithm, one of the videos went off. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James said in the 7th video, which amassed 85.6 million views.",
      "What followed was not just a viral moment, but a turning point for James' career, leading to a New York Times profile an in-person group 7 event in Los Angeles.",
      "What comes after group 7? A lot, James says.",
      "Life before and after \u2018group 7\u2019",
      "Before her viral moment, James describes her career as an independent artist as \u201cpretty stagnant.\u201d",
      "She graduated from UCLA with a degree in jazz. \u201cI just knew that I wanted to do music my whole life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI figured if I had a good understanding of jazz theory and practice, I could translate it easily to whatever genre I chose.\u201d",
      "Since college, she has worked all over the music industry, from session pianist to backup vocalist to touring opener and keyboardist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had my hands in about 10 different pies at any given point, with the intention of making the solo artist career full-time,\u201d James says.",
      "As an independent artist, social media was the \"only tool in her arsenal\" for getting her own music out into the world \u2014 but she did not expect her impulsive batch of videos to blow up. She says she was \u201cjust trying things and feeling silly,\u201d so she was shocked when the seventh video took off.",
      "This journey and group 7 have not only changed her goals, but the scale of her audience and the reach of her music. James gained over 100,000 TikTok followers after going viral, according to The New York Times.",
      "The viral moment also helped James catch the attention of SiriusXM\u2019s Mikey Piff, who discovered her song \u201cSo Unfair\u201d through the group 7 video. James explains that Piff emailed her asking to play her on the station.",
      "\u201cI was like, that\u2019s crazy \u2014 I never, ever thought I would ever have a song on the radio,\u201d James says. \u201cI consider that the pinnacle of a music career.\u201d",
      "James says \u201cSo Unfair\u201d then transferred over to the Hits 1 station because of the positive response to the song.",
      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s been really unbelievable and very massive,\u201d James says.",
      "Still, life after group 7 can come with pressure. James says she has felt some expectations to recreate the viral success, but she knows it was a \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment.",
      "\u201cI will never top the group 7 video, at least on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is my magnum opus on social media.\u201d",
      "New year, new music",
      "James says if people want more excitement, they should turn to her music. Instead of chasing another viral hit, James is focused on building her future. She says her upcoming album, to be released in 2026, represents a creative shift.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most explorative I\u2019ve ever been in music,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd and playful in a lot of ways, and it\u2019s been really fun to explore that side of artistry.\u201d",
      "James says earlier songs were more \u201cdeeply existential and grim,\u201d where the new album is a lot more \u201cexplosive.\u201d She feels all the feelings, ranging from anger to humor.",
      "\u201cTo be an artist you don\u2019t have to be tortured,\u201d James says. \u201cYou can also be a trickster, you can be playful and excited and angry.\u201d",
      "These feelings in her music are inspired by lived experience, relationships and music she\u2019s listened to across eras. In her mind, these are songs that could be enjoyed and on the radio 15 years ago or 15 years from now.",
      "Much of her upcoming album was shaped by the two years she spent writing it, a period filled with \u201ca lot of living.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have the freedom to dream bigger than I have felt like I was allowed to in a long while,\u201d James says.",
      "Going forward, James hopes to spend as much time on the road as possible. \u201cI want to tour forever,\u201d she says. \u201cSo come hang.\u201d",
      "In other words \u2014 we're all in group 7 now."

She has used the improbable platform she developed pursuing McLeod to write two books \u2014 \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cThe Capture\u201d \u2014 and to help other grieving parents navigate the mix of frustration, despair and confusion left by an unsolved homicide.",
      "Wentzel has assisted a nonprofit that helps law enforcement agencies with a series of cases in recent years, including the disappearance and alleged murder of Maya Millete, according to the Cold Case Foundation\u2019s co-executive director. Through a nonprofit Wentzel established, Angels of Justice, she launched a campaign urging the White House to treat the country\u2019s massive backlog of unsolved murders as a national emergency.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokeswoman blamed former President Joe Biden for failing to enable law enforcement agencies to \u201ctruly fight crime\u201d and said that President Donald Trump is \u201crestoring integrity to our justice system.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Marshals Service, which apprehended McLeod, declined to comment on questions about Wentzel\u2019s role in finding him, but in a statement after McLeod\u2019s capture the agency\u2019s director said Wentzel had worked \u201cdiligently with law enforcement these past years to see this day of justice arrive.\u201d",
      "The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office has said she was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the search for McLeod.",
      "\u201cShe goes for it,\u201d said Pat Kuiper, who credits Wentzel with helping push investigators in Washington state to take another look at the nearly two-decade-old unsolved murder of her son. \u201cShe goes for it in such a way that people can\u2019t really refuse her, because she\u2019s so genuine and kind, but persistent, assertive.\u201d",
      "For Rachel Glass, whose daughter was found strangled along with her pregnant roommate in Arizona 15 years ago, Wentzel provided an empathetic ear and insight into an investigative process that Glass \u2014 a longtime nurse \u2014 knew nothing about.",
      "\u201cIf there are things that go on and you think, what the hell is this, I\u2019d call her and say, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened now,\u201d Glass recalled. \u201cAnd she might tell me x, y and z about why it has to play out like that.\u201d",
      "Wentzel\u2019s husband of nearly three decades, a retired post office maintenance engineer, attributes her latest chapter to the tenacity she\u2019s always shown.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something I lack,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get easily discouraged and say, forget it. But my wife, she\u2019s not gonna forget it.\u201d",
      "A deadly date in San Diego",
      "For Wentzel, that chapter began soon after the death of her daughter. According to a statement of facts filed by the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, McLeod had gotten into a fight at a San Diego bar June 9, 2016, after he grabbed Mitchell by the throat and a man intervened, telling him to stop.",
      "Mitchell was found dead the next day at the apartment where they were staying. According to the statement, a deputy medical examiner determined she had been strangled and later compared the severity of the injury to someone who\u2019d been struck with a baseball bat or had their neck stomped on.",
      "Mitchell, 30, had been visiting the city with McLeod from Phoenix, where the divorced mother of two worked as a property manager, Wentzel said. To her mother, Mitchell was the life of the party \u2014 and someone who turned heads whenever she walked into a room.",
      "Mitchell met McLeod through work a few weeks before \u2014 he\u2019d gone to her office to rent an apartment, her mother said \u2014 and they\u2019d traveled to San Diego. Mitchell was impressed by how much McLeod seemed to care for his young son, Wentzel said, and she didn\u2019t appear to know about his previous allegations of domestic violence.",
      "One of those alleged incidents occurred not long before their trip, court records in California show. In Riverside County, he was charged that April with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse \u2014 an alleged crime that involved accusations that he strangled his wife, according to the statement of facts.",
      "McLeod pleaded not guilty, the Riverside County records show, and in a filing his lawyers in Mitchell\u2019s case have said that he has a \u201chistory of consensual sexual practices that included elements of the BDSM community such as bondage, whipping, slapping, choking and erotic asphyxiation, sometimes to unconsciousness.\u201d",
      "That earlier case was not adjudicated, however, and McLeod disappeared after Mitchell\u2019s death. According to prosecutors, on June 10, he allegedly drove Mitchell\u2019s car to San Diego International Airport, where he rented another car and headed to Mexico.",
      "An international search",
      "The San Diego Police Department identified McLeod as a person of interest in Mitchell\u2019s death almost immediately. A warrant seeking his arrest in her murder was filed June 13.",
      "But McLeod was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Wentzel recalled, the Marshals Service got involved and offered a reward. But she became frustrated with the government\u2019s inability to quickly investigate leads in foreign countries, she said. U.S. embassies seemed less than enthusiastic about helping, she said, and she recalled a deputy marshal telling her that they couldn\u2019t just \u201crun in and get the guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s another country,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cWe got to get approval.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "So Wentzel began searching herself. Although she\u2019d worked for several years as a police officer and detective in her native Guam decades ago, she said that experience didn\u2019t begin to prepare her for the years of social media sleuthing that she was about to embark on.",
      "One of her first steps was to pull together a \u201cwanted\u201d poster with pictures of McLeod, along with a brief description of the slaying and the reward amount \u2014 at the time $5,000, she said. She focused on Belize, a place she\u2019d heard he might be, and circulated information among dozens of Facebook accounts \u2014 gyms and resorts, restaurants and a university, screenshots of the messages show.",
      "After posting the information to a buy/sell group, Wentzel recalled, the responses started rolling in. Some were by phone. Others came via WhatsApp or Facebook.",
      "\u201cMadam I saw this man I am sure of it from his tattoos and his face,\u201d one message read, according to a screenshot.",
      "\u201cIf he is here he will b caught,\u201d read another.",
      "But then, he wasn\u2019t. And the messages continued. There were tips that he was in Honduras, that he was in Guatemala. Some tipsters seemed to legitimately want to help, she said. Others seemed like scammers.",
      "\u201cOne guy contacted me and said, OK, he\u2019s here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI know where he\u2019s working at. I\u2019ve got pictures. I\u2019ve got all this. So, you know, I need you to send me $1,000.\u201d",
      "There were so many tips, said Mike Wentzel, that fielding them became a 24/7 job for his wife. At times, he considered asking her to dial things back, but never could.",
      "\u201cThis is her child,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell her to stop?\u201d",
      "But there were times when the thought crossed her mind. Keeping hope alive during the pandemic, when that steady flow of tips dried up, was especially difficult, she said.",
      "The final tip",
      "As this slump in information dragged on, Wentzel said, local and federal officials announced that McLeod had been added to the Marshals\u2019 list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. In the spring 2021 announcement, they also announced that the reward for information leading to McLeod\u2019s arrest had grown to $50,000.",
      "His last known location was in Guatemala in 2017, the officials said.",
      "Wentzel said she believes it was a tip linked to that Central American country that ultimately led to McLeod\u2019s capture. Five years after he was spotted in Guatemala, she said, a couple of tipsters told her they\u2019d seen McLeod at a hotel just north of the country\u2019s border with El Salvador.",
      "Wentzel surveyed YouTube videos from the hotel to see if she could spot his face, she recalled, and she posted a \u201cwanted\u201d ad on Facebook that targeted accounts in the area. Wentzel said she set a 100-mile radius for the ad, meaning that everyone in that zone would see McLeod\u2019s face.",
      "Eventually, Wentzel said, she learned from the Marshals Service that someone saw one of her ads and shared a brochure with authorities that appeared to show McLeod. The brochure was from a Salvadoran English school not far from the Guatemalan hotel, she said.",
      "It was this image that prompted Wentzel to conclude: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d",
      "Four days later, on Aug. 30, 2022, authorities announced that McLeod had been taken into custody in Sonsonate, El Salvador, where he\u2019d been teaching English. He landed in San Diego the next day.",
      "Wentzel wrestled with a tangle of emotion as McLeod\u2019s arraignment approached. She thought about her daughter\u2019s final moments and ticked through a litany of revenge fantasies, she recalled. But she didn\u2019t want to stew in hatred and bitterness. So she tried to focus on her daughter\u2019s children, whom she and her husband have raised, and on the other victims she\u2019s sought to help.",
      "\u201cMurder does this to you \u2014 it makes you somebody you\u2019re not, if you allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture living my life out like this. I wanted to be a grandma and I just wanted to travel and have fun and live the rest of my life out with my family. But it made me something else.\u201d"

      "Despite bombs raining down and a lack of tools, feed and medicine, the shelter has remained operational throughout the two-year conflict, working to help emaciated and injured dogs, cats, donkeys and horses.",
      "At the shelter\u2019s site in Deir al-Balah, several dogs with three legs are among the animals running around, a stark reminder of the toll that the war has taken. In a large tent, veterinarians and volunteers work together to place an IV into the leg of a small, whimpering puppy.",

During the worst aid shortages, the team shared scarce rice, pasta and canned tuna with the animals, a desperate measure to prevent starvation.",
      "Since the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza\u2019s animal population has plummeted. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an estimated 97% of the strip\u2019s livestock has been destroyed through bombing, starvation and looting. This includes cows, sheep, goats and poultry.",
      "Large animals like donkeys and horses have dropped to around 30% of their former numbers.",
      "Stray pets have not been spared; countless dogs and cats were abandoned as families fled, leading to a surge in malnutrition, diseases like parvovirus, anemia and respiratory infections. Veterinary reports describe animals in states of \u201ccachexia\u201d \u2014 severe wasting \u2014 with weakened immune systems exacerbating outbreaks of gastroenteritis, jaundice and eye diseases.

      "President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy return to the negotiating room on Sunday with a familiar, fraught task: trying once again to chart a path toward ending Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "The two leaders have met three times since Trump took office for a second time in January, with each encounter carrying high expectations but producing few concrete results, and sometimes even appearing to push a resolution further away.",
      "As Kyiv presses Trump to deliver security guarantees, questions remain over whether the Florida summit marks a genuine turning point or another round of high-stakes diplomacy with little for Zelenskyy to take home.",
      "Eight months ago, a White House meeting in February ended in acrimony and failed to produce the breakthrough Trump had promised on \u201cday one\u201d of his administration.",
      "European leaders flanked Zelenskyy on his next visit to the White House in August as they grappled for a voice in the faltering negotiations, but Europe has since remained largely shut out of high-level talks as Russia refuses to budge from its maximalist demands.",
      "There now appear to be signals from the Ukrainian camp that Kyiv may be prepared to compromise with Moscow.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday in a Telegram post that \u201cmuch can be decided before the New Year,\u201d but \u201cwhether decisions will be made depends on our partners.\u201d",
      "Last week, he outlined elements of an updated proposal that would see Ukraine potentially withdraw troops from parts of the east without recognizing captured areas as Russian territory, with a demilitarized zone established in their place.",
      "Such suggestions had previously appeared to be red lines in peace talks. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of any plan to end the war.",
      "But he has remained firm on another issue.",
      "Zelenskyy said the question of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, aimed at preventing further Russian incursions, would ultimately depend on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That said, Ukraine\u2019s history underscores the dangers of relying on security assurances as a long-term solution. The Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994 in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, committed the U.S. and Russia to respecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "It was shattered in 2014 with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and incursions in eastern Ukraine, followed by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, which sparked the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "It remains unclear whether Zelenskyy\u2019s optimism is widely shared. He presented a united front with European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney after meetings on Saturday, though there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said countries would work toward a \u201cshared objective,\u201d divisions have blown up in recent weeks over since-dropped plans to hand seized Russian assets to Ukraine.",
      "And it\u2019s unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Trump himself, will ultimately respond to Zelenskyy\u2019s latest peace offerings.",
      "Putin told some of Russia\u2019s top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine, but that he wanted full control of the Donbas region, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.",
      "\u201cVladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that \u2018Donbas is ours,\u2019\u201d Kommersant reported. In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas, though outside that area \u201ca partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out,\u201d wrote columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.",
      "Such hard-line demands, held by Putin throughout the conflict, still appear well at odds with Zelenskyy\u2019s pathway to peace.",
      "While demilitarized zones remain a possibility, Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the United States have not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas it still controls.",
      "After heavy Russian strikes hit Kyiv across the weekend, killing two and injuring dozens more, Zelenskyy said Saturday that Putin is not interested in peace, accusing him of seeking to prolong the war and \u201cuse every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering.\u201d",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has remained publicly noncommittal. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s visit, he told Politico: \u201cWe will see what he\u2019s got.\u201d",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "Still, expectations persist that there will be something new for the duo to say Sunday, after years of deadlock and over a million dead.",

      "Born a brunette on Sept. 28, 1934, in Paris, Bardot became world famous after she dyed her hair blond and starred in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman,\u201d which was directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim.",
      "The provocative French melodrama about a voluptuous teenager who scandalizes Saint-Tropez was a box office smash both abroad and in the United States, despite mixed critical reviews and condemnation by watchdog groups like the National Legion of Decency.",
      "Dubbed a \u201csex kitten\u201d by British film producer Tony Tenser, Bardot broke through as the so-called sexual revolution was underway, women were embracing birth control, and many moviegoers were searching for racier fare.",
      "French feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir called her a \u201clocomotive of women\u2019s history\u201d and \u201cthe most liberated woman in post-war France\u201d in a 1959 essay titled \u201cBrigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome.\u201d",
      "French President Charles de Gaulle declared that Bardot was a \u201cFrench export as important as Renault cars.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, BB, as the French affectionately called her, went on to appear in more than 40 movies, including a handful of Hollywood productions, before retiring from acting at age 39.",
      "But before she retreated to her estate on the French Riviera to lead a far more reclusive life, Bardot bared it all in the pages of Playboy to mark her 40th birthday.",
      "And soon she was championing a new cause.",
      "\u201cI gave my youth and my beauty to men,\u201d Bardot later said, \u201cbut I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\u201d",
      "Bardot appealed to the Danish queen to halt the mass killings of dolphins in the Faroe Islands.",
      "Bardot became a hero to animal rights activists. And in 1985, when France awarded her the Legion of Honor medal, Bardot insisted it was for her work to save animals \u2014 not for her movies.",
      "\u201cI take this Legion of Honor for my fight in favor of animals,\u201d Bardot declared.",
      "In 1986, the former actor founded the Brigitte Bardot Foundation and harnessed her fame to lead campaigns against, among other things, the eating of horse meat and the hunting of turtle doves in France.",
      "In her later years, Bardot gravitated to far-right politics and was fined repeatedly for inciting racial hatred against Muslim immigrants to France, according to news reports.",
      "In her 1996 memoir, Bardot outraged many fans by declaring her support for far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Her fourth husband, businessman Bernard d\u2019Ormale, had been an adviser to Le Pen.",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful.\u201d",
      "The Nazis were occupying Paris when Bardot was growing up in a luxurious seven-bedroom apartment and dreaming of becoming a ballerina.",
      "Raised by conservative Catholic parents, Bardot chafed against her upbringing. But she was allowed to take dance classes. And in 1950 she landed, at age 15, on the cover of Elle magazine after the editor spotted her at a train station.",
      "That led to a movie audition the next year, where Bardot met Vadim, who was 24 at the time.",
      "Despite the age difference, they fell in love. And over her parents\u2019 objections, Bardot and Vadim married on Dec. 21, 1952, three months after her 18th birthday.",
      "Bardot embarked on a movie career that, early on, included a small part in the 1953 Hollywood production \u201cAct of Love,\u201d starring Kirk Douglas.",
      "Three years later, while shooting an Italian movie called \u201cMio figlio Nerone,\u201d Bardot dyed her hair blond at the urging of the director and turbocharged her career.",
      "Bardot was box office gold and even won critical acclaim for her turns in internationally produced movies like \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960) and \u201cViva Maria!\u201d (1965). But she mostly steered clear of Hollywood, although she did play herself in the 1965 comedy \u201cDear Brigitte.\u201d",
      "Bardot did not think much of her own acting.",
      "\u201cI started out as a lousy actress and have remained one,\u201d she reportedly said, according to The Guardian.",
      "Bardot also recorded some 60 pop songs in the 1960s and 1970s, many of them in collaboration with French singer Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she had an affair while married to her third husband, German millionaire Gunter Sachs.",
      "One of Bardot\u2019s best-known musical forays was a cover of Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cYou Are the Sunshine of My Life\u201d with French singer Sacha Distel.",
      "By her own admission, Bardot\u2019s personal life was tempestuous.",
      "Her marriage to Vadim began falling apart on the set of \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d when she embarked on an affair with her co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant.",
      "It was one of many infidelities that Bardot has admitted to over the years.",
      "Two years later, Bardot married actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she had her only child \u2014 a son named Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in January 1960.",
      "Bardot, in her memoir, wrote that she was \u201cnot made to be a mother.\u201d She wrote that her unborn child was like a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that she tried to remove by punching herself in the stomach.",
      "When that marriage broke up after three years, Charrier got custody of their son.",
      "Father and son later sued Bardot for the \u201churtful remarks\u201d in the memoir and were awarded $36,200 in damages.",
      "Bardot and her son, who lives in Norway, later reconciled. And she met her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.",
      "Her three-year marriage to Sachs in 1966 was also marked by multiple infidelities, but it ended in an amicable divorce.",
      "\u201cA year with Bardot was worth 10 with anyone else,\u201d Sachs reportedly said after the marriage was over.",
      "Bardot, in public statements, rarely revisited her acting career once it was over. In a 2007 interview, she appeared to be at a loss when asked how she came to be an icon of French cinema.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that I arrived and left at the right time. My wild and free side unsettled some, and unwedged others.\u201d"

      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",

      "They have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding.

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia\u2019s much smaller neighbor in February 2022, has not backed off maximalist demands that would see Ukraine blocked from integrating with the West and limit its ability to defend itself.

      "On the side of a dusty road in Gaza, dozens of mostly young men gather against the counter of a makeshift storefront. Under a canvas roof, the acrylic display cases are filled with boxes of high-end cellphones.",
      "It is a surreal spectacle: Palestinians, many displaced from their bombed-out homes, malnourished, sick and jobless in this collapsed economy, being sold the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. Even budget phones have been selling for as much as 5,000 shekels \u2014 around $1,500 \u2014 according to customers in Gaza, where prices have spiked to 10 times those in other countries.",
      "That such luxury items are in supply, but often food or medicine is still scarce, is exasperating aid workers and Palestinians. Experts interviewed for this story said Israel\u2019s border controls often make commercial goods easier to transport than humanitarian aid. Though the flow has increased during the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations and other groups say they are still facing serious restrictions on urgent items.",
      "\u201cWe cannot even afford food \u2014 how are we supposed to afford phones?\u201d asked Samir Kamal Awad Abou Dakaa, 52, who was a construction worker before the war and has a wife and five children to feed.",
      "His family lives in a tent encampment in the southern city of Khan Younis, where his kids are given Arabic lessons using a scrap of blackboard and fed rice at a local soup kitchen. His faded blue track jacket, thinning hair and quiet voice betray what he calls a \u201cbeyond difficult\u201d life.",
      "This contrast is not new for Gaza, said Mona Jebril, a research fellow at England\u2019s University of Cambridge who lived in the territory for 22 years. \u201cBefore the war and during the siege, there were mobile phones and expensive cars. But because of the extra restrictions on the borders, the massive devastation and humanitarian catastrophe, then this paradox comes to light even more.\u201d",
      "This is the latest twist in efforts to get aid into Gaza during a patchy ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan appears to be holding, albeit with regular Israeli airstrikes, the crisis endures.",

      "The ceasefire has changed things. Some 65,000 pallets of aid came into Gaza during the first month of the ceasefire, the U.N. said, double the previous four weeks. But essential equipment, such as forklift trucks and mobile storage units, is still being \u201csystematically rejected by Israeli authorities,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said. Medical equipment, food parcels and solar lighting, meanwhile, are still being \u201cblocked from entry at scale\u201d by Israeli restrictions, administrative controls and logistics backlogs, OCHA said.",
      "An analysis of Israeli figures by The Associated Press earlier this month showed there has been a shortfall in aid deliveries, with Israel agreeing to let in 600 trucks per day but the true daily average totaling 459."

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sense of anger is palpable among members of the Jewish community in and around Bondi Beach as it reels from the attack on a Hanukkah celebration that killed 15 people.",
      "Much of their fury is directed at the government, which has been accused of failing to heed warnings about antisemitic threats ahead of the Dec. 14 attack. But there has also been sadness and soul-searching about the place the community has in a neighborhood well known for its Jewish roots, and in Australia\u2019s wider society.",
      "Linda Royal said her parents fled Poland after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1939, arriving first in Lithuania. They landed in Sydney two years later, aided by illegal transit visas issued by a Japanese diplomat.",
      "\u201cLike many migrants, they came to Bondi because it was working-class and inexpensive,\u201d she told NBC News last week close to the site of the shooting, on a hill where thousands of flowers had been laid in tribute to the victims.",
      "In the years since her parents\u2019 arrival, Royal said, the Jewish community has swelled in the neighborhood and its surrounding suburbs, first with Holocaust survivors and later with refugees known as refuseniks from countries in the former Soviet Union, some of whom had been denied permission to emigrate to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge sense of community,\u201d Royal said. \u201cThe Jewish community sticks together. We\u2019re constantly unfortunately on the run from persecution.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in decades has \u201ccompletely ripped us apart,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d",
      "Authorities have identified the two suspects as 24-year-old Naveed Akram and his 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram. The elder Akram was shot dead at the scene, while his son was charged last week with 59 offenses, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after waking up from a coma.",
      "Investigators have said the pair were inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group. Two homemade ISIS flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police have said. ISIS has praised but not officially claimed the attack, referring to it in an official publication as \u201cSydney\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "As well as sadness about the attack, \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of anger, a great deal of rage,\u201d Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said via phone on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that not only was the writing on the wall, but the community explicitly and repetitively told the government what was going to happen,\u201d said Ryvchin, who was born in Ukraine before he moved to Australia as a child.",
      "The shooting was \u201ca clear escalation from violent slogans and aggressive street protests and abuse of Jews on the streets, to harassment and vandalism of Jewish property and then finally the firebombings,\u201d he said, referring to several arson attacks on synagogues in recent years. This \u201cwas always going to end in murder, and that\u2019s exactly where we are,\u201d he added.",
      "Ryvchin, whose former home was daubed with antisemitic language and cars were set alight earlier this year, said both Australia\u2019s federal government and provincial leaders in the state of New South Wales had failed to act on proposals to curb antisemitic violence.",
      "These included more visible policing and a clampdown on pro-Palestinian protests that had become increasingly aggressive and turned people against the Jewish community, he added.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose poll numbers were found by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper to have plunged by 15 points in the wake of the attack, said Tuesday that his government would address hate speech and gun control and work with states on new laws.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "New South Wales, where Bondi is situated, debated tougher gun laws on Tuesday. The state\u2019s leader is also trying to ban the display of terrorist symbols and curb protests. Other states have indicated they\u2019ll try to follow suit.",
      "But while they were welcomed by some, others were critical of the hasty way the government tried to bring them in. Antony Loewenstein, a journalist and author who serves on the advisory committee of the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \u201cPalestinian freedom,\u201d said: \u201cI think they\u2019re an absolute abomination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are rushed, not thought through, and they\u2019re arguably unconstitutional,\u201d he said, adding that he thought they would be challenged in court.",
      "Three activist groups representing those in support of Palestine and Indigenous Australians have said they\u2019ll challenge the proposed laws in Australia\u2019s high court.",
      "Loewenstein also disputed Ryvchin\u2019s claim that pro-Palestinian marches in Australia, some of the largest of which have taken place in Sydney, had incited violence against the Jewish community.",
      "Australia is home to many \u201cprogressive Jews who are deeply against Israel\u2019s mass slaughtering in Gaza\u201d and oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, Lowenstein said.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is literally no connection that we are aware of between the murderers, these two men, father and son, and the pro-Palestine movement. Zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried and scared, of course, by the direct targeting of Jews but also deeply concerned that our fears are being weaponized in the service of deeply antidemocratic and draconian policies,\u201d he added.",
      "Others like Ryvchin are calling for a Royal Commission, or a major public inquiry into the attack. It is necessary so \u201cJewish people can walk down the street without fear and maybe next year we can get together again, as we have every year, and kindle the Hanukkah flames and hopefully not do it with police snipers on roofs,\u201d he said.",
      "Albanese has so far resisted calls to do this, saying he wants to avoid a drawn-out process and that Royal Commissions haven\u2019t been held after similar incidents.",
      "Whether it takes place or not, back in Bondi, Linda Royal said things would not be the same again.",
      "\u201cWe now associate this place with yet another place of a Jewish massacre, and that can never be taken away,\u201d she said."

The war began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 251 people were taken hostage.",

The Israeli military remains inside Gaza, though it has withdrawn to positions behind a \u201cyellow line\u201d separating areas under Israeli and Palestinian control.",
      "Trazi said he was first displaced nearly two years ago following Israeli bombardment and has lived in the church since.",

      "Before the war, Christians in Gaza would make a trip to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank or visit Jerusalem, but Gaza\u2019s borders remain closed to civilians even as the ceasefire continues.",

      "Amazon has blocked hundreds of job applications from suspected North Korean operatives, according to the U.S. tech giant's chief security officer, amid growing concerns over cyber scams connected to Pyongyang.",
      "\u201cTheir objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime\u2019s weapons programs,\u201d Stephen Schmidt wrote Friday on LinkedIn, adding that applicants were using fake or stolen identities to pursue remote IT jobs in the U.S. and worldwide.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped more than 1,800 suspected DPRK operatives from joining since April 2024,\u201d he said, using the initialism for the secretive communist state\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cWe\u2019ve detected 27% more DPRK-affiliated applications quarter over quarter this year,\u201d he added.",
      "The fraud was detected by Amazon's AI-powered application screening system combined with manual verification by its staff, he said.",
      "Schmidt said the agents often use so-called laptop farms \u2014 computers physically based in the U.S. but operated remotely from abroad \u2014 to conceal their true locations.",
      "In June, the Justice Department said it had uncovered 29 illegal \u201claptop farms\u201d across the U.S. that were being used by North Korean IT workers.",
      "Those cases involved U.S.-based people who created fraudulent companies and \"hosted laptop farms,\" giving North Korean agents remote access to U.S. victim company-provided laptop computers, the Justice Department said in a news release at the time.",
      "\u201cThese schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime\u2019s illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\u201d Assistant Attorney General John A. Eisenberg of the Justice Department's National Security Division was quoted as saying in the release.",
      "The following month, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in prison for running a laptop farm that helped North Korean IT workers get remote jobs at over 300 U.S. companies.",
      "The scheme generated more than $17 million in illicit revenue for her and Pyongyang, the Justice Department said in a statement at the time.",
      "NBC News did not receive an immediate response when it asked the North Korean Embassy in London for comment Tuesday.",
      "Schmidt wrote in his post numerous other strategies used by fraudulent workers are likely to be operating at scale across the whole industry.",
      "Amazon is one of the world\u2019s largest employers, and its experience of large-scale cyber threats \u201cgives us unique visibility into how these operations evolve and a responsibility to share what we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.",

      "Identity theft and various LinkedIn strategies have become more elaborate, with fraudulent workers impersonating real software engineers and hijacking LinkedIn profiles of active professionals, Schmidt said.",
      "\"We\u2019ve also identified networks where people hand over access to their accounts in exchange for payment,\" he added.",
      "\u201cSmall details give them away,\u201d he said, warning employers to watch out for common signs of fraud, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and inconsistent education histories.",
      "The U.S., Japan and South Korea held a joint forum in Tokyo to improve collaboration against the growing threat of North Korean operatives posing as IT workers in August.",
      "In a joint statement, the three countries said that \u201chiring, supporting, or outsourcing work to North Korean IT workers increasingly poses serious risks, ranging from theft of intellectual property, data, and funds to reputational harm and legal consequences.\u201d"
