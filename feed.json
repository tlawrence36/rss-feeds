      "LONDON -- British police on Wednesday charged a member of Irish hip-hop group Kneecap with a terrorism offense for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert.",
      "The Metropolitan Police force said Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, 27, was charged under the Terrorism Act with displaying a flag in support a proscribed organization. The alleged offense happened at the Kentish Town Forum, a London concert venue, on Nov. 21, 2024.",
      "The force said the musician \u2013 whose stage name is Mo Chara and whom police referred to by the English spelling of his name, Liam O\u2019Hanna -- was charged by postal requisition and is due in court on June 18.",
      "Police are still investigating footage from another Kneecap concert in November 2023.",
      "The Belfast trio has been praised for invigorating the Irish-language cultural scene in Northern Ireland, where the status of the language remains a contested political issue in a society still split between British unionist and Irish nationalist communities. It has also been criticized for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references and for political statements.",
      "Kneecap was not well known outside Northern Ireland before the release of a raucous feature film loosely based on the band\u2019s origins and fueled by a heavy mix of drugs, sex, violence, politics and humor. The group\u2019s members played themselves in \u201cKneecap,\u201d which won an audience award when it was screened at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It was shortlisted for best foreign-language picture and best original song at this year\u2019s Academy Awards, though it didn\u2019t make the final cut.",

      "ATLANTA -- The rapper known as Rod Wave faces more than a dozen charges, some involving a gun, after he turned himself in to sheriff's officials in Georgia on Tuesday.",
      "Wave, whose real name is Rodarius Green, voluntarily surrendered to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office on warrants stemming from an April 21 police call in the Atlanta suburb of Milton, police there said.",
      "A police report obtained by the AP describes officers finding luxury cars with bullet holes in them and signs of a break-in at the home in one of Georgia's most exclusive communities last month. But it does not explain why authorities are now accusing the rapper of several crimes.",
      "\u201cThere is no truth to these charges,\u201d the rapper\u2019s lawyers Drew Findling and Marissa Goldberg said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cRod Green was a victim of a burglary and committed no crimes,\" they said. \"How he was even charged as a result of this situation is incomprehensible. This will absolutely be resolved favorably to Mr. Green.\u201d",
      "On April 21, Milton police responded to a home in the town north of Atlanta after a 911 report described \u201ca possible domestic disturbance,\u201d police said in a statement. A neighbor had heard yelling and screaming, and saw a woman crying, officers wrote in their initial report.",
      "Officers determined that the call was related to a previously unreported burglary and the discharge of a firearm at the location, police said. They later obtained arrest warrants for Green, who lived there.",
      "The charges include aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit a felony, criminal damage to property and pointing or aiming a gun at someone, Fulton County Jail records show. He's also accused of tampering with evidence \u2014 a felony \u2014 and obstruction of law officers.",
      "An initial police report obtained by the AP describes what officers found at the home when they arrived April 21. A gold Mercedes SUV had multiple bullet holes in it, and a black Rolls-Royce vehicle had a single bullet hole, the report said.",
      "\u201cIn the basement, we found a large safe that had been dragged across the floor, opened, and emptied,\u201d an officer wrote.",
      "Green's girlfriend told officers that she had returned home and found that the house appeared to have been burglarized. In the back of the home near the swimming pool, officers found a broken window and a hammer in a bush next to it. A black Glock handgun was also found at the scene, officers wrote.",
      "The initial report does not list any suspects who might have broken in, emptied the safe or shot the vehicles, nor does it accuse Green of committing any crimes.",
      "Green was released on bond shortly after turning himself in on the same day, Tuesday, authorities said.",
      "The 26-year-old Florida rapper is celebrated for his soul-trap sound, a unique melding of R&B and rap that has earned him 11 singles certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Four of his six albums hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s top R&B/hip-hop albums chart, including his most recent, 2024\u2019s \u201cLast Lap.\u201d",

      "Green grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he has had at least one past scrape with the law before a domestic battery charge was dismissed in 2022.",
      "An ex-girlfriend had accused Green of entering her home in the Orlando area and choking her while their two children were in another room, according to an arrest warrant. The two had dated for about four years, and the girlfriend told investigators that Green accused her of seeing other men while they were broken up.",
      "Prosecutors later told court officials that the case was not suitable for prosecution.",

      "This lighthearted, globe-trotting heist from Guy Ritchie, debuting on AppleTV+ on Friday, stars Natalie Portman and John Krasinski as estranged siblings attempting to piece together historical facts in hopes of finding the mythical spring. The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",
      "Her character, Charlotte, is an art historian who had an adventuresome childhood with her explorer father and brother Luke (Krasinski) but has since settled for a more stable life. We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "The main character, played by Denzel Washington, is a Knicks fan who won\u2019t tolerate Celtics green in his house. A framed jersey of Jalen Brunson hangs in his Brooklyn apartment. There are movie references peppered throughout, of \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Smell of Success.\u201d Yankee Stadium plays a pivotal setting. In one scene, Nicholas Turturro even yells directly into the camera: \u201cBoston sucks!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not counting on Boston for box office!\u201d Lee says with a roaring cackle during an interview on a rooftop terrace in Cannes. \u201cWe might as well just write that off.\u201d",
      "Some of Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival. The premiere of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cHigh to Low,\u201d came shortly before the Knicks begin their Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Indiana Pacers. Everywhere Lee has gone at the French Riviera festival, he\u2019s gone in blue and orange, including a pinstripe suit on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a film by a New Yorker who loves New York. But if you\u2019re not that, it doesn\u2019t detract from you enjoying it. You could be from \u2026 (Lee raises an eyebrow) \u2026 Indiana,\u201d Lee says before letting out a maniacal roar. \u201cWait a minute, we got to write off another market, too!\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which A24 releases in theaters Aug. 22 before it streams on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5, was one of the most eventful premieres of Cannes. Washington was surprised with a Palme d\u2019Or. (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t acting,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Only three or four people knew.\u201d) Washington also got in an angry tangle with a photographer on the red carpet after his arm was grabbed.",
      "\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve told that photographer: \u2018Do not touch Denzel Washington or it\u2019s going to be a (expletive) problem,\u2019\u201d Lee says, laughing. \u201cThe headline, \u2018Man on Fire,\u2019 hoooooo! That was a good headline.\u201d",
      "Lee then picks up the digital recorder lying in front of him and says in a calm, professional voice: \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is a public service announcement. Do not put your hands on Mr. Denzel Washington. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Thank you very much.\u201d",
      "But Lee, 68, has been more than happy to mix it up in Cannes. Before an interview, he taunted European journalists about his adopted Premier League team, Arsenal. At the press conference earlier in the day, he quoted Yoda for his primary message to film students: \u201cThere is no try, only do.\u201d Said Lee: \u201cAre you faking the funk or are you serious?\u201d",
      "Lee, who last debuted 2018\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in Cannes, tried to avoid saying anything too pointed about President Donald Trump. But couldn\u2019t help himself when asked about the moral decisions that mark \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we can talk about American values considering who is president,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "Lee was also on an apology tour at the festival. Four years ago, he was the head of the jury that awarded Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cTitane\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or. Only Lee, confused by the French-language ceremony, accidentally revealed the winner too soon. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Lee, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going down in the history of Cannes.\u201d",
      "Just ahead of Lee's interview with The Associated Press, Ducournau, in Cannes with her \u201cTitane\u201d follow-up, \u201cAlpha,\u201d crossed the terrace to warmly embrace him. Recalling \u201cTitane,\u201d Lee said, \u201cA car impregnates a woman? You gotta win. You got my vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has been referred to as a remake of \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d but the degree to which it\u2019s a Spike Lee joint surprised festivalgoers. Washington plays David King, a wealthy record label executive whose son, along with the son of his friend and driver (Jeffrey Wright), is kidnapped for ransom. The kidnapper, played by A$AP Rocky, accidentally releases the wrong young man, leaving King with the decision to fork over the $17.5 million ransom for a young man who\u2019s not his son.",
      "The film is, in part, an ode to Kurosawa, whom Lee discovered as a film student at NYU. He credits his \u201cRashomon\u201d as the basis of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d He met Kurosawa briefly once and has an autograph from the Japanese master signed with a paint brush. \u201cI got to shake his hand,\u201d says Lee.",
      "\u201cI grew up with my mother taking me to musicals,\" he says. \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was one. If you listen to that great song by Rogers and Hammerstein with Julie Andrews singing it. What did Coltrane do to it? That\u2019s my analogy. What Coltrane did to \u2018My Favorite Things,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what we did with this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is less driven as a Kurosawa homage than by Lee\u2019s own obsessions: New York, music, the moral dilemmas of a Black entertainer and, yes, that Boston sucks. Above all, it\u2019s another Lee protagonist forced to do the right thing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that. I never thought about that connected to the decisions David King has to make,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBut what you see is the turmoil he\u2019s going through. He\u2019s going through it. A moral decision. Money on one hand, a life on the other.\u201d",
      "More than any recent film of his, you can sense Lee having fun. Back in New York. Back with Denzel. \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together but the first in 19 years after 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d \"It\u2019s not like we had to catch up,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe never lost a step.\u201d",
      "But Lee suspects \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d marks the end of their collaboration \u2014 one of cinema\u2019s greatest actor-director pairings, spanning \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d Lee shrugs, citing Washington\u2019s retirement plans. \u201cAnd then the other day he\u2019s doing a film with the guy from \u2018City of God,\u2019 so. Denzel put that on himself: \u2018I\u2019m doing this thing and then I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 I\u2019ll believe it when he hangs it up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d reaches a blistering crescendo when King confronts Rocky\u2019s kidnapper in a basement recording studio. A kind of rap battle ensues that Lee gives much of the credit to Washington for. The actor improvised many of his lyrics, drawing heavily from Nas. (\"That was not scripted,\" says Lee. \u201cWe had to pay for that!\u201d)",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. Denzel is such a powerful force. Not a derogatory term, but he\u2019s a beast. If you got somebody who don\u2019t got it, Denzel is going to slaughter them. SLAUGHTER,\" Lee explains. \u201cRocky is from Harlem, uptown. So I knew that he\u2019s not going to punk out. He\u2019s going to stand there, feet planted to the ground, as a heavyweight fight, blow to blow to blow.\u201d",
      "For Lee, the scene is a summation of what he loves about moviemaking and what delights him so much courtside at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see a championship fight, and that\u2019s what it is. That is, in boxing terms, a slugfest,\u201d says Lee. \u201dThat makes great cinema. It makes great sports. You\u2019ve got conflict. It\u2019s a battle, and they\u2019re slugging it out.\u201d",

      "Rapper and actor Kid Cudi is expected to testify at the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sex trafficking trial",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapper and actor Kid Cudi is expected to testify at the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sex trafficking trial, taking the witness stand either Wednesday or Thursday to tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs was enraged when she left him for a period of time in 2011 and began dating Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi. She said Combs left a large bruise on her back where he kicked her as she left his Los Angeles home for the last time that year.",
      "Prosecutors have contended in court filings that Combs was so upset that he arranged to have Cudi's convertible firebombed.",
      "A prosecutor said at the end of Tuesday's court session that Mescudi will be the third witness after a federal agent finishes testifying about what investigators found last year when they raided Combs\u2019 home in Florida.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his fame and fortune to oversee a two-decade-long racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence.",
      "His lawyers say evidence in the case reflects domestic violence, not anything amounting to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi several times in 2011 to work on music. She said her relationship with Cudi began late in the year and she got a burner phone so the two could communicate without Combs learning about it.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in so-called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that involved sexual performances with male escorts that Combs watched and sometimes participated in. It was during one of those \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that Combs picked up her regular phone and noticed communications that revealed Cassie was seeing Cudi, Cassie said.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie's mother, Regina Ventura, testified that she received an email in December 2011 from Cassie saying that Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Afterward, Regina Ventura said, she received a demand from Combs for $20,000. Scared for her daughter's safety, she went to the bank and sent Combs the money, only to have it returned by Combs days later.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother's Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and stayed for three or four days. She said she broke up with him.",
      "\u201cIt was just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much danger, too much uncertainty of, like, what could happen if we continued to see each other.\u201d",
      "Cassie said she told her family she was going to Los Angeles after the holidays to \u201cget to work.\u201d But instead, she said, she traveled after New Year's to meet Combs in Arizona, where he had gone to visit a college with his son. They resumed their relationship.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country, Combs told her that Cudi's car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi's friends there to see it, Cassie said.",

      "PARIS -- Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet.",
      "The bust taken in 1988 from P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by a financial anti-corruption unit, Paris police said in an Instagram post Monday.",
      "There was no immediate word on whether the bust would be returned to the grave or what other investigation might take place.",
      "Morrison, the singer of Doors classics including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cBreak on Through,\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d was found dead in a Paris bathtub at age 27 in 1971.",
      "He was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the city's cemetery that is the final resting place of scores of artists, writers and other cultural luminaries including Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Edith Piaf.",
      "The 300-pound bust made by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin was added to the grave in 1981 for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death.",
      "\u201cI think it would be incredible if they put the bust back onto where it was and it would attract so many more people, but the cemetery wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold that many people,\u201d Paris tour guide Jade Jezzini told The Associated Press. \u201cThe amount of people who would rush in here just to see the bust to take pictures of it, it would be incredible.\u201d",
      "Known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, theatrical stage presence and mystical manner, Morrison has inspired generations of acolytes who congregate at his grave to reflect and sometimes to party, including a major gathering for the 50th anniversary of his death. The site has often been covered with flowers, poetic graffiti and liquor bottles left in tribute.",
      "He was undergoing a cultural renaissance when the bust was stolen in the late 1980s, which peaked with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cThe Doors,\u201d in which Val Kilmer, who died in April, played Morrison.",
      "London artist Sam Burcher recently returned to the now more subdued grave site that she first visited 40 years ago when the sculpture of Morrison was still in place.",
      "\u201cThe bust was much smaller than all of these grand tombs. It was very modest, so I was quite surprised by that,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut the other thing was the atmosphere, it was buzzing. There were people partying, smoking, music, dancing, and then I brought strawberries and kind of gave them out to everyone ... it was just such an amazing experience.\u201d",
      "Morrison cofounded the Doors in Los Angeles in 1965 with Ray Manzarek. Robby Krieger and John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band and its frontman burned brightly but briefly, releasing albums including \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u201cStrange Days,\" and \u201cMorrison Hotel, whose The California site that gave that album its name and cover image was seriously damaged in a fire last year.",
      "After their final album, 1971\u2019s \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d Morrison moved to Paris. His cause of death was listed as heart failure, though no autopsy was performed as none was required by law. Disputes and myths have surrounded the death and added to his mystique.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",

      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",
      "McMahon has made clear she opposes settling with Trump \u2014 just like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who quit last month.",
      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",
      "McMahon, in her note, said that \u201cthe past few months have been challenging.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place, and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to the tussle with Trump, Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has expressed unhappiness over some network coverage of Israel's war in Gaza, including a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece this winter. Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",
      "That extra layer contributed to Owens' resignation. One of the show's correspondents, Scott Pelley, said on the air that \u201cnone of us is happy\u201d about the changes.",
      "CBS News is also trying to establish the new anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois at its flagship \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d broadcast amid ratings troubles.",
      "In his note to staff members, Cheeks praised McMahon for expanding local news at CBS stations and improving their competitive positions, along with improving the network's digital offerings.",

      "Starting later this year, new episodes will run on Netflix, PBS and the PBS Kids app on the same day. No specific premiere date was immediately announced. Select past episodes will be available on Netflix worldwide.",
      "The change for the more than 50-year-old show comes after Warner Bros. Discovery \u2014 which had aired the show since 2016 \u2014 last year decided not to renew its deal for new episodes that air on HBO and Max, though episodes will remain there until 2027.",
      "\u201cThis unique public-private partnership will enable us to bring our research-based curriculum to young children around the world with Netflix\u2019s global reach, while ensuring children in communities across the U.S. continue to have free access on public television to the \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 they love,\u201d Sesame Workshop said in its press release.",

      "For Season 56, episodes will revolve around one 11-minute story, the Netflix release said.",
      "\u201cThe more kids want to hang out with our characters on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 the more they\u2019re going to take in those lessons,\u201d said Perez, adding that there would also be updates to the show\u2019s look and feel. The new season will also feature more exploration of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d neighborhood and a look inside the legendary two-story brownstone at 123 Sesame Street that houses Elmo, Bert and Ernie and more.",
      "\u201cI strongly believe that our educational programming for children is one of the most important aspects of our service to the American people, and \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 has been an integral part of that critical work for more than half a century,\u201d said Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to continue our partnership in the pursuit of having a profound impact on the lives of children for years to come.\u201d",

      "Frederick Doe, 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.",
      "\u201cThose responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,\" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. \u201cYou foolishly agreed to assist.\u201d",

      "The toilet weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million pounds and it was insured for 4.74 million pounds.",
      "The piece that poked fun at excessive wealth had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "The theft of the toilet \u2014 which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold \u2014 caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.",
      "Of the group who smashed a window to get into the palace before dawn on Sept. 14, 2019, only two have been charged and convicted.",
      "James Sheen, 40, previously pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy and transferring criminal property. Michael Jones, 39, was convicted of burglary at the trial where Doe was convicted. Sheen and Jones will be sentenced June 13.",

      "Doe, who was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property, was given a two-year suspended term and ordered to perform 240 hours of unpaid work.",

      "Cannes had flipped around some of its scheduling to accommodate Washington's speedy France trip, which came on his lone off-day while performing \u201cOthello\u201d in New York. Cannes Film Festival chief Thierry Fr\u00e9maux surprised Washington with the award before the Monday night premiere.",
      "\u201cThis is my brother, right here,\u201d said the film\u2019s director, Spike Lee, who passed the award to Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is a total surprise for me,\u201d said Washington.",
      "The festival usually gives out one or two honorary Palmes each edition \u2014 last year, the awardees were Studio Ghibli and George Lucas. Last week, Robert De Niro received one on the festival's opening night. De Niro's award was announced in advance, but surprise prizes aren't unheard of: In 2022, Tom Cruise was presented with a surprise honorary Palme d'Or just before the screening of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",
      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",
      "\u201cHe told me to tell you: Thank you for the love,\u201d Lee told the crowd after the screening. \u201cHe's on Broadway doing \u2018Othello,\u2019 so it really took a lot for him to fly here. Let's give it up for Denzel Washington, please.\u201d",
      "Lee also came to Cannes with obligations back in New York on his mind. He arrived at the film\u2019s premiere decked out in Knicks colors and wearing a blue and orange striped suit. Lee ended his brief speech in the Palais by hollering: \u201cNew York Knicks!\u201d",
      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d will be released in theaters by A24 on Aug. 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5.",

      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",
      "Rats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.",
      "\u201cGary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\u201d BBC director-general Tim Davie said. \u201cAccordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\u201d",
      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",
      "In a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \u201cgenuine mistake\u201d and \u201cshould have been more diligent.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for it, and never should be.\u201d",
      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",
      "Lineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, \u201cGaza: How to Survive a War Zone,\u201d to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",
      "Lineker is one of England\u2019s greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram. He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",
      "\u201cMatch of the Day\u201d \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season. None of them are former soccer players.",

      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Wes Anderson isn\u2019t driving the bus. Laurent is. That\u2019s the name of the driver who\u2019s bringing Anderson, and his bus, to the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "As they drive from his home in Paris to the South of France, Anderson explains by phone: \u201cI don\u2019t drive the bus. You have to have, like, four years of training and an EU bus driver\u2019s license. The thing is, if you\u2019re going to drive a bus like this, you\u2019ve got to be able to drive it in reverse, too.\u201d",
      "For years, Anderson has, in favor of the normal festival cars that shuttle guests, brought his own bus to Cannes so his whole cast can arrive together at the premiere. On Sunday, Anderson and company (including Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Scarlett Johansson and Bryan Cranston) will pile in for the premiere of Anderson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s another example of how Anderson has made something quite unusual into a regular tradition.",
      "With remarkable regularity, Anderson has been crafting movies uniquely his own since his 1996 debut, \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201d There are variations. Some are expansive family dramas (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Some are more intimate (\"Rushmore\"). Some are more densely layered (\"Asteroid City\").",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a leaner tale which Focus Features will release May 30, is Anderson working in high comic gear. A playful and poignant kind of thriller, it stars Del Toro as the tycoon Zsa-Zsa Korda, who decides to name his daughter, a novitiate (Threapleton) heir to his dubiously accrued fortune.",
      "The wheels keep turning for the 56-year-old Anderson. But there are signs of time passing, too. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris is hosting an Anderson retrospective, as well as an exhibition of props, costumes and artifacts from his expansive personal archive.",
      "Anderson, who has a 9-year-old daughter with his wife, the costume designer Juman Malouf, spoke about those things and others on his way to Cannes to unveil \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\" a movie that adds yet another fitting mantra to the world of Wes: \u201cWhat matters is the sincerity of your devotion.\u201d",
      "ANDERSON: We\u2019ve been keeping this stuff for so long. The experience of doing it was kind of great. I\u2019d sort of get pulled over there to approve things. And my reaction was, \u201cWell, we have more stuff.\u201d So we kept adding things. My daughter has lived with a lot of this stuff. The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "New Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week's Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious.",
      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",

      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",

      "Attention spans are shrinking, with research showing the average person's has declined from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to 47 seconds now",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

    "summary": "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
    "story": [
      "Infant twins suffered from malnutrition in Nigeria",
      "DIKWA, Nigeria -- Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria\u2019s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.",
      "\u201cFeeding is severely difficult,\u201d said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa \u2014 virtually the entire population \u2014 rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",
      "Programs serving children were hit hard.",
      "Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.",
      "But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.",
      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",
      "Charles Mangwiro in Maputo, Mozambique, contributed to this story.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

      "The May 25 election organized by Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is the latest step in a push to annex the Essequibo region, which Venezuela has long claimed as its own.",
      "Venezuelans living in Guyana who become involved in Sunday\u2019s elections could also face arrest and deportation, Khan added.",
      "Nearly 100,000 people of direct or indirect Venezuelan ancestry currently live in Guyana, according to Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud.",
      "\u201cShouldn\u2019t this reality give all Guyanese a cause to be alert? People\u2019s vigilance is equivalent to people\u2019s power and defense,\u201d Persaud said in a recent social media post.",
      "The Essequibo region represents two-thirds of Guyana and is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources. It also is located close to massive offshore oil deposits, with current production averaging some 650,000 barrels daily.",
      "On Sunday, Venezuelans will head to the polls to elect governors and lawmakers, as well as officials who would supposedly administer the Essequibo region.",
      "In 2023, Maduro threatened to annex the region by force after holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.",
      "The dispute over the region began more than a century ago, when an international tribunal in 1899 drew the border between the South American neighbors.",
      "In 2018, Guyana went to the International Court of Justice and asked judges to uphold the 1899 ruling. Meanwhile, Venezuela has dismissed the border drawn more than a century ago, noting Guyana was still a British colony. It has argued that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising despite an emergency summit held in late 2023 to diffuse the situation.",
      "Last week, Guyana\u2019s government reported three separate attacks from the Venezuelan side on Guyanese soldiers patrolling a border river. Earlier this year, six Guyanese soldiers were injured in a separate attack, some of them seriously.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Nicole Theriot has dismissed Maduro\u2019s threats as \u201cjust bluster aimed at shoring up domestic support.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone should see the sham for what it is. It\u2019s saber-rattling from the Maduro regime, nothing more,\u201d she said at a public forum Tuesday, stressing that the U.S. stands with Guyana.",

      "\u201cI assure you Tanzania is safe, and we will find those responsible,\u201d he said.",
      "On Wednesday, X remained inaccessible within Tanzania for those not using a virtual private network. But users of VPNs without permission can face jail terms or fines.",
      "Many politicians, intellectuals and critics in Tanzania express their opinions freely on X. But the government of Hassan, who is up for reelection in October, has sought to suppress online dissent.",
      "Ahead of the election, fear is growing among government critics and opposition figures who allege government repression through legal processes and other means.",

      "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana spoke to Parliament while presenting an updated budget \u2014 one without the value-added tax increases that had sparked public outcry and fierce disagreement among parties in the ruling coalition.",
      "Without that tax revenue, he said, South Africa doesn't have enough money to make up for the cuts that have threatened the vast network of support for one of the world's largest HIV-positive populations.",

      "The United States once cheered the creation of South Sudan as an independent nation. Now the U.S. is being asked to explain why it appears to be deporting migrants from as far away as Vietnam to a chaotic country that's once again in danger of collapsing into civil war.",
      "A U.S. judge ordered Trump administration officials to appear at an emergency hearing Wednesday to answer questions.",
      "If the deportations are confirmed, that means people from Vietnam, Cuba and elsewhere are being sent to a nation they have no link to, thousands of miles from where they want to be. Vietnam's list of its embassies in Africa shows the closest one to South Sudan is in Tanzania, over 800 miles away.",

A peace deal reached in 2018 has been fragile and not fully implemented, to the frustration of the U.S. and other international backers. South Sudan still hasn\u2019t held a long-delayed presidential election, and Kiir remains in power.",
      "His rivalry with Machar is compounded by ethnic divisions. Machar has long regarded himself as destined for the presidency, citing a prophecy years ago by a seer from his ethnic group.",
      "Earlier this year, the threat of war returned. Machar was arrested and allies in the government and military were detained following a major escalation that included airstrikes and an attack on a United Nations helicopter. Machar\u2019s opposition party announced South Sudan\u2019s peace deal was effectively over.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not mince words: What we are seeing is darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 civil wars, which killed 400,000 people,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s pressure on South Sudan to take in deportees, including foreign ones, is in sharp contrast to Washington\u2019s past warm embrace as its rebel leaders \u2014 including Kiir and Machar \u2014 fought for independence.",
      "Now there is less support than ever for most of South Sudan's over 11 million people because of the cuts in U.S. aid.",
      "Climate shocks including flooding have long caused mass displacement and closed schools. South Sudan\u2019s health and education systems were already among the weakest in the world. Aid organizations had offered essential help.",
      "South Sudan's government has long relied on oil production, but little money from that is seen, in part because of official corruption. Conflict in neighboring Sudan has affected landlocked South Sudan\u2019s oil exports. Civil servants at times go months without being paid.",
      "How South Sudan is equipped to handle migrants arriving abruptly from the U.S. is yet to be seen.",

Although it is hard to define an age group for personalized programs, Prevost's plan was more befitting of men aged 50-55. Masella would train him two or three times a week in sessions lasting up to an hour.",
      "So, how much does the pope bench? Masella can\u2019t speak to his papal power, since Prevost was focused on posture and cardiovascular capacity. He ran on his favorite treadmill that faces a mural featuring famous local landmarks, among them St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican.",
      "\u201cWe would start off slow and then go pretty strong, I must say. Especially a lot of resistance on the exercise bike, a very strong climb,\u201d Masella said.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him make a comment about anything that wasn\u2019t positive. He was always positive about everything -- the weather, the city, the people, also for me, he said he liked the gym.\u201d",

      "After Prevost took over the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Bishops in 2023, he said in an interview with the Augustinian Order that his new job had left him little free time to practice his game. While the Mediterranean climate makes tennis possible year-round, the papacy will likely leave him even fewer chances to step onto a court.",
      "Tamburlani, the Omega owner, says the Holy Father is welcome back any time he wants to squeeze in a workout. After all, his membership's still active.",
      "\u201cThis would make us so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would organize our gym to guarantee his safety and his privacy. We would just need a sign.\u201d",

      "He said all the climbers were safe and returning back to lower camps after the successful ascent on Wednesday",
      "Climbers normally spend weeks at base camp to acclimatize to the higher altitude. They make practice runs to the lower camps on Everest before beginning their final attempt on the peak, so that their bodies are prepared for the low pressure and lower level of oxygen available.",
      "The new method is likely to reduce the time climbers spend out of their home countries and cut the number of days they need to take off work, also cutting down on expenses.",
      "Nepal does not have any rules on how many days climbers must spend acclimatizing or making practice climbs. Their permits, which cost $11,000 each, are valid for 90 days. Climbing season normally wraps up by the end of May, when the weather deteriorates and monsoon season begins. The ropes and ladders fixed to the mountain are then pulled out.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested that an unpopular measure which deprived millions of retirees of an annual winter fuel subsidy will be changed",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested Wednesday that a hugely unpopular measure which deprived millions of retirees an annual winter fuel subsidy will be changed, a striking reversal in policy.",
      "Starmer said he wanted to help people with the cost of living and added that he wanted more retirees to be eligible for the so-called winter fuel payments. He spoke during his weekly questioning in the House of Commons after figures were released showing inflation was up at its highest level in over a year.",
      "\u201cAs the economy improves, we want to make sure people feel those improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we want to ensure that as we go forward more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.\u201d",
      "Soon after Labour came to power last July, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves removed the winter fuel allowance, worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($266 and $399) a year, from all but the poorest retirees, arguing that the measure was needed because of the dire state of the public finances left by the previous Conservative government.",
      "The move has arguably contributed to a swift decline in popularity for Starmer's government since it was elected. In local elections in England earlier this month, Labour fared poorly, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Since then, there's been growing speculation that the government will change tack by either scrapping the measure or increasing the level at which the allowance is paid.",
      "Starmer told lawmakers that the decision will be made \"as part of a fiscal event.\u201d It's unclear whether that would be on June 11 when Reeves will outline her spending plans for government departments over the coming three years, or in her next budget in the fall.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because of the measures we\u2019ve taken that the economy is improving, growth at the highest rate in the G7, four interest rate cuts, three trade deals because countries want to trade with this country because of the decisions that we\u2019ve made,\" Starmer said.",

      "But it\u2019s more than just religious devotion that the golden-domed shrine became known for during Syria\u2019s prolonged civil war.",

The shrine and the surrounding area, which bears the same name, has emerged as one symbol of how the religious and political increasingly intertwined during the conflict.",
      "With such a legacy, local Shiite community leaders and members are now navigating a dramatically altered political landscape around Sayyida Zeinab and beyond, after Assad\u2019s December ouster by armed insurgents led by the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The complex transition that is underway has left some in Syria\u2019s small Shiite minority feeling vulnerable.",

      "She has several titles, such as the \u201cmother of misfortunes\u201d for enduring tragedies, including the 7th-century killing of her brother, Hussein. His death exacerbated the schism between Islam\u2019s two main sects, Sunni and Shiite, and is mourned annually by Shiites.",
      "Zeinab's burial place is disputed; some Muslims believe it\u2019s elsewhere. The Syria shrine has drawn pilgrims, including from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. Since Assad\u2019s ouster, however, fewer foreign visitors have come, an economic blow to those catering to them in the area.",
      "Over the years, the Sayyida Zeinab area has suffered deadly attacks by militants.",
      "In January, state media reported that intelligence officials in Syria\u2019s post-Assad government thwarted a plan by the Islamic State group to set off a bomb at the shrine. The announcement appeared to be an attempt by Syria\u2019s new leaders to reassure religious minorities, including those seen as having supported Assad\u2019s former government.",
      "Al-Khatib, who moved his family from Aleppo province to the Sayyida Zeinab area shortly before Assad\u2019s fall, said Assad had branded himself as a protector of minorities. \u201cWhen killings, mobilization ... and sectarian polarization began,\" the narrative \"of the regime and its allies was that \u2018you, as a Shiite, you as a minority member, will be killed if I fall.\u2019\u201d",
      "The involvement of Sunni jihadis and some hardline foreign Shiite fighters fanned sectarian flames, he said.",
      "The Syria conflict began as one of several uprisings against Arab dictators before Assad brutally crushed what started as largely peaceful protests and a civil war erupted. It became increasingly fought along sectarian lines, drew in foreign fighters and became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers on different sides.",
      "Recently, a red flag reading \u201cOh, Zeinab\" that had fluttered from its dome was removed after some disparaged it as a sectarian symbol.",
      "Sheikh Adham al-Khatib, a representative of followers of the Twelver branch of Shiism in Syria, said such flags \u201care not directed against anyone,\u201d but that it was agreed to remove it for now to keep the peace.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a clash to happen. We see that ... there\u2019s sectarian incitement, here and there,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Shiite leaders had wrangled with some endowments ministry officials over whether the running of the shrine would stay with the Shiite endowment trustee as it\u2019s been, he said, adding \u201cwe've rejected\" changing the status quo. No response was received before publication to questions sent to a Ministry of Endowments media official.",
      "Adham al-Khatib and other Shiite leaders recently met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve talked transparently about some of the transgressions,\u201d he said. \u201cHe promised that such matters would be handled but that they require some patience because of the negative feelings that many harbor for Shiites as a result of the war.\u201d",
      "Many, the sheikh said, \u201care holding the Shiites responsible for prolonging the regime\u2019s life.\u201d This \u201cis blamed on Iran, on Hezbollah and on Shiites domestically,\" he said, adding that he believes the conflict was political rather than religious.",
      "Early in the conflict, he said, \u201cour internal Shiite decision was to be neutral for long months.\u201d But, he said, there was sectarian incitement against Shiites by some and argued that \u201cwhen weapons, kidnappings and killing of civilians started, Shiites were forced to defend themselves.\u201d",
      "Regionally, Assad was backed by Iran and the Shiite militant Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose intervention helped prop up his rule. Most rebels against him were Sunni, as were their patrons in the region.",
      "Besides the shrine's protection argument, geopolitical interests and alliances were at play as Syria was a key part of Iran\u2019s network of deterrence against Israel.",
      "Today, rumors and some social media posts can threaten to inflame emotions.",
      "Shrine director Jaaffar Kassem said he received a false video purporting to show the shrine on fire and was flooded with calls about it.",
      "At the shrine, Zaher Hamza said he prays \u201cfor safety and security\u201d and the rebuilding of \u201ca modern Syria, where there\u2019s harmony among all and there are no grudges or injustice.\u201d",
      "Is he worried about the shrine? \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are in the protection of Sayyida Zeinab \u2014 not the ones who will protect the Sayyida Zeinab,\" he replied.",
      "While some Shiites have fled Syria after Assad\u2019s fall, Hamza said he wouldn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cSyria is my country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I went to Lebanon, Iraq or to European countries, I\u2019d be displaced. I\u2019ll die in my country.\u201d",
      "Some are less at ease.",
      "Small groups of women gathered recently at the Sayyida Zeinab courtyard, chatting among themselves in what appeared to be a quiet atmosphere. Among them was Kamla Mohamed.",
      "Early in the war, Mohamed said, her son was kidnapped more than a decade ago by anti-government rebels for serving in the military. The last time she saw him, she added, was on a video where he appeared with a bruised face.",
      "When Assad fell, Mohamed feared for her family.",
      "Those fears were fueled by the later eruption of violence in Syria\u2019s coastal region, where a counteroffensive killed many Alawite civilians \u2014 members of the minority sect from which Assad hails and drew support as he ruled over a Sunni majority. Human rights groups reported revenge killings against Alawites; the new authorities said they were investigating.",
      "\u201cWe were scared that people would come to us and kill us,\u201d Mohamed said, clutching a prayer bead. \u201cOur life has become full of fear.\u201d",
      "Another Syrian Shiite shrine visitor said she's been feeling on edge. She spoke on condition she only be identified as Umm Ahmed, or mother of Ahmed, as is traditional, for fear of reprisals against her or her family.",
      "She said, speaking shortly after the coastal violence in March, that she\u2019s thought of leaving the country, but added that there isn\u2019t enough money and she worries that her home would be stolen if she did. Still, \u201cone\u2019s life is the most precious,\u201d she said.",
      "She hopes it won\u2019t come to that.",
      "\u201cOur hope in God is big,\u201d she said. \u201cGod is the one protecting this area, protecting the shrine and protecting us.\u201d",

      "The comments by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi come after multiple rounds of talks between the two nations, including at an expert level over the details of a possible deal. However, none has been reached yet and American officials including President Donald Trump, Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio maintain that Iran must give up enrichment \u2014 something it didn't do in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "\u201cI have said it before, and I repeat it again: uranium enrichment in Iran will continue \u2014 with or without an agreement,\u201d Araghchi said, according to state television.",
      "Araghchi added that Iran is \u201ccurrently reviewing whether to participate in the next round and when to take part\u201d in talks with the U.S. The U.S. and Oman, which is mediating the negotiations, have yet to announce any fifth round of talks. Trump's trip to the Mideast last week delayed any new meeting. Negotiators previously met in Muscat, Oman, and Rome.",
      "\u201cWe have never abandoned diplomacy. We will always be present at the negotiating table, and the main reason for our presence is to defend the rights of the Iranian people,\u201d Araghchi said. \u201cWe stand against excessive demands and rhetoric at the table.\u201d",

Meanwhile, Israel has threatened to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on its own if it feels threatened, further worsening tensions in the Mideast already spiked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers capped Tehran\u2019s enrichment level at 3.67% and reduced its uranium stockpile to 300 kilograms (661 pounds). That level is enough for nuclear power plants, but far below weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Since the nuclear deal collapsed in 2018 with Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program and enriched uranium to up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels. There have also been a series of attacks at sea and on land in recent years, stemming from the tensions even before the Israel-Hamas war began.",

But it\u2019s facing public backlash over allegations that under-regulation has made the drug available to children and caused addiction.",

      "Thailand\u2019s Health Minister Somsak Thepsutin said at a press conference that officials are aiming to roll out new regulations in coming weeks that will tighten control on the sale of cannabis, including requiring shops to sell cannabis only to customers who have a prescription.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The world's sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt economies and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.",
      "The Paris-based International Energy Agency's report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity \u2014 but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.",

      "Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.",
      "\u201cThe golden rule of energy security is diversification,\u201d Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cAnd it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.\"",

      "Inflation in the U.K. spiked to its highest level for more than a year in April amid higher domestic bills such as energy and water",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Inflation in the U.K. spiked to its highest level for more than a year in April amid a raft of higher domestic bills, such as energy and water, official figures showed Wednesday.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said that its key measure of inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose by 3.5% in the year to April, up from 2.6% in March.",
      "April's rate was the highest since January 2024 and above expectations for a more modest increase to 3.3%.",
      "The scale of the rise was also the largest since October 2022, at the height of the energy crisis in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Economists had anticipated a sizeable increase as April saw hefty annual price rises for an array of household bills, as well as the impact of higher taxes on businesses and a sizeable increase in the minimum wage.",
      "Inflation is widely expected to stay above 3% for the rest of the year, which could rein in expectations of further interest rate reductions from the Bank of England, whose target for inflation is 2%.",
      "On Tuesday, the bank's chief economist, Huw Pill, said that borrowing rates have been cut too quickly, in a sign that he's concerned about underlying inflation pressures.",
      "Since it started cutting borrowing costs last August from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the bank has proceeded on a gradual basis by lowering its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point every three months. Earlier this month, it reduced it to 4.25%.",
      "Following the latest inflation update, Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that cuts on a \u201cprecise quarterly schedule\u201d are \u201cfar from certain.\u201d",
      "Even though inflation is expected to run above the bank's target this year, economists expect it to fall next year, partly because of the recent trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. which will mean many of the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump had planned have been ditched.",
      "Still, the sharp increase in inflation is a tricky moment for the Labour Party government, which returned to power last July for the first time in 14 years. In recent weeks, Labour touted what it considers to be economic successes, including higher than anticipated first-quarter growth and a trio of trade deals. As well as the tariff pact with the U.S., the government has concluded a trade deal with India and reset the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union after Brexit.",
      "\u201cI am disappointed with these figures, because I know cost of living pressures are still weighing down on working people,\" Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said.",
      "The main opposition Conservative Party, which Labour replaced in power, sought to pin the blame on Reeves' decision to increase the tax burden on businesses.",
      "\u201cFamilies are paying the price for the Labour Chancellor\u2019s choices,\" said Mel Stride, the Tories' economy spokesman.",

      "A charismatic Marxist leader who seized global attention by defiantly declaring his country could rely on itself, Sankara came to power in 1983 at the age of 33 after he and former ally Blaise Compaore led a leftist coup that overthrew a moderate military faction. But in 1987, Compaore turned on his former friend in a coup that killed Sankara in the capital \u2014 and later became president himself.",
      "Nearly four decades after his death, Sankara is being celebrated in Burkina Faso, a nation of 23 million people once known for its bustling arts scene and vibrant intellectual life \u2014 including Sankara's anti-imperialist and pan-African legacy.",
      "\u201cWhen I stepped inside the mausoleum, I felt the revolution,\u201d said Timot\u00e9, a 22-year-old who said he came because of what he heard about Sankara at home and at school.",
      "Sankara's mausoleum, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, has been the project of current military leader Capt. Ibrahim Traore.",
      "Since taking power during a coup in 2022, Traore has presented himself as the new Sankara. He has named one of the main streets after the revolutionary leader, elevated him to the rank of Hero of the Nation and revived revolutionary slogans such as \u201cFatherland or death, we will win!\u201d in most of his speeches.",
      "The mission of the mausoleum is \"to keep the flame of the revolution alive and to remind the world of Capt. Thomas Sankara\u2019s fight to break the chains of slavery and imperialist domination,\u201d Burkina Faso Prime Minister Jean Emmanuel Ou\u00e9draogo said as he read Traore's statement.",
      "Despite promising to fight the security crisis that pushed them to stage a coup, Burkina Faso's military leaders have struggled to deal with the worsening crisis. According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "Human rights groups say the military leadership has installed a system of de facto censorship, crushing critics, while many have been killed by jihadi groups or government forces.",
      "As people flocked to Ouagadougou to celebrate Sankara, life elsewhere in the country reflects a different reality.",
      "\u201cWe can go out for a bit in the city center, but with caution,\u201d said one student from Dori, the capital of the northern region, echoing concerns about restrictions on free speech and movement.",
      "The student spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being arrested.",
      "Security concerns have permeated every aspect of life outside Ouagadougou. Even the price of beer has skyrocketed as more places become inaccessible to traders.",
      "\u201cThere are two Burkina Fasos,\u201d said a teacher from the east, speaking on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. \u201cOne where the streets are deserted at night, and another that comes alive to enjoy the cool evening air.\u201d",

      "The early-morning arrests in various parts of Germany were accompanied by searches at 13 properties, federal prosecutors said in a statement.",
      "Four of those arrested \u2014 identified only as Benjamin H., Ben-Maxim H., Lenny M. and Jason R., in line with German privacy rules \u2014 are suspected of membership in a domestic terror organization. The fifth, Jerome M., is accused of supporting the group. Two of the arrested also are accused of attempted murder and aggravated arson. All are between the ages of 14 and 18.",
      "Prosecutors said they are also investigating three other people, ages 18 to 21, who are already in custody. All the suspects are German citizens.",
      "According to the prosecutors, the group was formed in mid-April 2024 or earlier. They said that its members saw themselves as the last resort to defend the \u201cGerman nation\u201d and aimed to bring about the collapse of Germany's democratic order, with attacks on homes for asylum-seekers and on facilities associated with the left-wing political spectrum.",
      "Two of the suspects set a fire at a cultural center in Altd\u00f6bern in eastern Germany in October, prosecutors said, adding that several people living in the building at the time escaped injury only by chance.",
      "In January, another two suspects allegedly broke a window at a home for asylum-seekers in Schm\u00f6lln and tried unsuccessfully to start a blaze by setting off fireworks. They daubed the group's initials and slogans such as \u201cForeigners out,\u201d \u201cGermany for the Germans\u201d and \u201cNazi area,\" as well as swastikas, prosecutors said.",
      "Also in January, three suspects allegedly planned an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in Senftenberg, but it never came about because of the earlier arrests of two of the men.",

      "In an annual report released Tuesday, the Federal Criminal Police Office said that the number of violent crimes with a right-wing motivation was up 17.2% last year to 1,488. That was part of an overall increase in violent politically motivated offenses to 4,107, an increase of 15.3%.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- U.S. President Donald Trump will host South Africa's leader at the White House on Wednesday for a meeting that might be tense after Trump accused the country's government of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to take place against minority white farmers.",
      "South Africa has strongly rejected the allegation and President Cyril Ramaphosa pushed for the meeting with Trump in an attempt to salvage his country's relationship with the United States, which is at its lowest point since the end of the apartheid system of racial segregation in 1994.",
      "Trump has launched a series of accusations at South Africa's Black-led government, including that it is seizing land from white farmers, enforcing anti-white policies and pursuing an anti-American foreign policy.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hopes to correct what he calls damaging mischaracterizations during the meeting, which is Trump's first with an African leader at the White House since he returned to office.",
      "Some in South Africa worry their leader might get \"Zelenskyy'd\" \u2014 a reference to the public bashing Trump and Vice President JD Vance handed out to the Ukrainian president in their infamous Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "In advance of the meeting, a White House official said Trump's topics of discussion with Ramaphosa were likely to include the need to condemn politicians who \u201cpromote genocidal rhetoric\u201d and to classify farm attacks as a priority crime. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, said Trump also was likely to raise South African race-based barriers to trade and the need to \u201cstop scaring off investors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know ahead of the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting.",
      "Trump's criticism of South Africa began in early February in a post on Truth Social when he accused South Africa's government of seizing land from white Afrikaner farmers and a \"massive Human Rights VIOLATION\" against members of the white minority.",
      "Trump's allegation that Afrikaners were being mistreated was at the center of an executive order he issued days later that cut all U.S. assistance to South Africa.",
      "He went further this month, alleging there was a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers and the Trump administration has brought a small group of white South Africans to the U.S. as refugees in what it says is the start of a larger relocation program.",
      "The U.S. has been asked if it will stand by the genocide allegation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with CBS that it would and that the administration felt there was evidence, citing instances of white farmers being murdered and claiming some were being \u201cforcibly removed\u201d from their properties.",
      "Some white farmers have been killed in violent home invasions. But the South African government says the causes behind the relatively small number of homicides are misunderstood by the Trump administration; they are part of the country's severe problems with crime and not racially motivated, it says. Black farmers have also been killed.",
      "The South African government has said the allegations against it are misinformation.",
      "South African Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen, who is white and a member of a different political party from Ramaphosa, said in an interview with The Associated Press that no land was being seized from farmers and claims of genocide were false.",
      "\u201cWhen you mischaracterize things like that and this misinformation gets out, it does have real-world consequences,\u201d said Steenhuisen, who is part of the South African delegation in Washington.",
      "The White House official said Trump would also likely impress on Ramaphosa the need for the South African government to publicly condemn politicians who repeat an apartheid-era chant that contains the lyrics \u201ckill the farmer\u201d and \u201cshoot the farmer.\u201d The chant is sometimes used at political rallies by a minority opposition party.",
      "It has often been cited by critics of South Africa \u2014 including South African-born Trump ally Elon Musk \u2014 as evidence of the persecution of white farmers because it uses the word Boer, which specifically refers to Afrikaners.",
      "While Ramaphosa's party does not use the chant, the government has not condemned it. An Afrikaner group says it should be labelled hate speech.",
      "Musk has been at the forefront of the criticism of his homeland, casting its affirmative action business laws as racist. Musk said on social media that his Starlink satellite internet service wasn't able to get a license to operate in South Africa because he was white.",
      "South African authorities say Starlink hasn't formally applied. If it did, it would be bound by laws that require foreign companies to allow 30% of their South African subsidiaries to be owned by shareholders who are Black or from other racial groups disadvantaged under apartheid.",
      "The Trump administration considered those laws a trade barrier and U.S. companies should be exempt from racial requirements, according to the White House official.",
      "Bloomberg reported Tuesday, quoting unnamed sources, that South Africa was willing to negotiate on easing the laws for Musk's Starlink in an attempt to defuse tensions with the U.S. Ramaphosa didn't comment on any possible discussions with Musk or his representatives when asked by South African reporters in Washington.",
      "Ramaphosa was also asked if he worried he might be \u201chumiliated\u201d in a public appearance with Trump. Parts of the South African media have questioned whether Ramaphosa might get \u201cZelenskyy'd\u201d at the White House \u2014 a reference to Trump's berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of the world's media.",
      "Trump has directed much of his criticism at Ramaphosa and senior government officials, accusing them of doing \u201csome terrible things.\u201d",
      "Ramaphosa said the meeting would focus on trade and normalizing relations and he was not concerned it would become confrontational or that he would be humiliated.",
      "\u201cSouth Africans are never humiliated, are they? South Africans always go into everything holding their heads high,\u201d he said.",

      "Campbell urged the Colombian government to protect the Kogui, Wiwa, Kankuamo, Arhuaco, and Ette Naka Indigenous groups, whose combined population is approximately 54,700 people.",
      "Campbell's statement followed a visit to the Sierra Nevada region, where U.N. officials spoke with representatives of these Indigenous tribes.",
      "\u201cThese groups are under various forms of cruel attack from non-state armed groups,\" Campbell said, highlighting the \u201cdevastating repercussions on their lives, their land, their territory, their self government...and their spirituality.\u201d",
      "In 2022, UNESCO added the ancestral knowledge of these Indigenous groups to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list.

      "But for many years, the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada have been under attack from settlers, and now from rebel groups.",
      "Campbell said that rebel groups in the area are imposing curfews on Indigenous communities and interfering with their local assemblies. He added that hundreds of Indigenous people from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta have been forcibly displaced, while last year an Arhuaco community leader was murdered and a member of the Kogui tribe disappeared.",
      "Colombia\u2019s government has struggled to pacify rural areas where rebel groups and drug trafficking gangs fight for territory abandoned by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the large guerilla group that made peace with the government in 2016.",
      "President Gustavo Petro has launched peace talks with most of the nation\u2019s remaining rebel groups, but the negotiations have yielded few results so far.",
      "Campbell urged the government to protect Indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada not only through military force, but by providing better access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities.",
      "\u201cThe violent situation has its roots in disputes over control of territory, drug trafficking routes and various forms of illicit economic activity by non-state armed groups.\u201d Campell said.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's agriculture minister resigned Wednesday over his inappropriate remark about buying rice as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food.",
      "At a party seminar Sunday in Saga prefecture, Taku Eto said he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because his supporters always give him the grain as gifts.",
      "The gaffe was seen as insensitive to the rice situation and could be further trouble for Ishiba\u2019s already struggling minority government before a national election in July.",
      "\u201cI made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices,\u201d Eto told reporters after handing in his resignation at the prime minister\u2019s office. Eto said Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted his resignation.",
      "\u201cI thought it is not appropriate for me to stay as head\u201d just as the government needs to tackle the rice price challenges, Eto said.",
      "Eto apologized to the people and also retracted his comment, saying he buys rice himself and was not living on rice gifts.",
      "Ishiba said he humbly accepts criticism as he bears responsibility for Eto\u2019s appointment. Media reports say Eto's successor will be popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi.",

      "The shortfall started last August on panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake. The supply pressure eased after the autumn harvest, but a shortage and price increases hit again early this year.",
      "Officials have blamed the supply shortage on poor harvests due to hot weather in 2023 and higher fertilizer and other production costs, but some experts blame the government\u2019s long-term rice production policy.",
      "The government released tons of rice from its emergency stockpile in recent weeks, but the latest agricultural ministry statistics show the release has hardly helped to ease the shortage or lower prices.",
      "The unprecedented release from emergency rice stockpile was seen in part as an attempt to figure out distribution problems. The government has denied there is now a rice shortage, but officials say it's a mystery why rice is not reaching consumers. Some experts say it's because the shortage was so serious.",

Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions \u2013 all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
      "For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa\u2019s capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.",
      "The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they\u2019ll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen violence this extreme,\" said Ernesto Zazueta, president of the Ostok Sanctuary. \u201cWe\u2019re worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.\u201d",
      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of the leader of one of the groups by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city which for years avoided the worst of Mexico\u2019s violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\u201cWith the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo. \u201cAnd the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\u201d",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \u201cI\u2019m going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\u201d",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions.",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn\u2019t made.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no safe place left in this city these days,\u201d said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it\u2019s safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\u201cMy son, my son, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going to leave you alone,\u201d screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son\u2019s dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \u201cWhy do the police do nothing?\u201d she cried out.",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018what are we doing here?\u2019\u201d Zazueta said. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk this happening again. If we don\u2019t leave, who will treat them?\u201d",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico\u2019s crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he\u2019s also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s at least more stable,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause here, today, it\u2019s just suffocating.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",

      "Retailers are trying to navigate their way through economic uncertainty in 2025. Tariffs, inflation and lingering fears of a recession have left many Americans uneasy and pulling back on spending.",
      "Because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, a retreat would heighten the odds of contraction for the U.S. economy.",
      "With earnings from major retailers wrapping up it's become clear that the trade war launched by the Trump administration is impacting retailers in very different ways.",
      "Walmart earned a public rebuke from President Donald Trump after it said last week that it has already raised prices and will have to do so again this summer, right when the back-to-school shopping season kicks off. Trump told the retail giant that it should \u201ceat\u201d the additional costs created by his tariffs.",
      "Home Depot said Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t expect to raise prices because of tariffs, saying it has spent years diversifying the sources for the goods on its shelves. However, executive Billy Bastek said some products on Home Depot shelves now may disappear. \u201cThere\u2019s items that we have that could potentially be impacted from a tariff that, candidly, we won\u2019t have going forward,\u201d Bastek said in a conference call with industry analysts.",
      "While retailers are sorting out how to best operate in a trade war, their customers are taking stock of their finances and the trends are not good. U.S. consumer sentiment declined slightly in May for the fifth straight month, surprising economists, as Americans increasingly worry that President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war will worsen inflation.",
      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, declined 2.7% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. The only lower reading was in June 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30%.",
      "Here's a quick look at some poignant details from retailers reporting quarterly financial results Wednesday.",
      "Target's sales dropped more than anticipated in the first quarter, and the retailer warned they will slip for all of 2025 year as its customers, worried over the impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending.",
      "Target also cut its annual sales projections. The company now expects a low-single digit decline for 2025 after previously projecting a 1% increase for sales.",
      "Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said during Target's conference call that the chain has been dealing with multiple issues impacting its business, including tariffs and declining consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cWe have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,\u201d he said. \u201cOur strategy is to remain price competitive by leveraging the capabilities, long-standing relationships and the scale that set us apart from many of our retail peers.\u201d",
      "TJX Cos., parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, has been pegged as one of the potential \u201cwinners\u201d of the shifting trade landscape, as Americans try to save money.",
      "That appeared to be the case Wednesday as the company beat both revenue and profit expectations on Wall Street.",
      "And CEO Ernie Herrman said the second quarter is off to a strong start.",
      "\u201cI am convinced that our broad assortments of great brands and fashions, at compelling prices, will continue to be a tremendous draw for shoppers seeking value,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, I am confident that the strength, flexibility, and resiliency of our off-price business model will serve us well in today\u2019s macro environment, as it has throughout our long, successful history.\u201d",
      "TJX maintained its fiscal 2026 forecast, which includes guidance for consolidated same-store sales to be up 2% to 3%.",
      "Lowe's first-quarter sales declined slightly to $20.9 billion from $21.4 billion a year earlier, but that was better than Wall Street expected, with the U.S. housing market in a slump.",
      "The home improvement company reaffirmed its 2025 outlook for sales in a range of $83.5 to $84.5 billion. It still expects same-store sales to be flat to up 1%.",
      "President and CEO Marvin Ellison said during the company's conference call Wednesday that approximately 60% of Lowe's purchases originate in the U.S. and about 20% of its purchase volume is currently concentrated in China.",
      "\u201cAlthough we're pleased with this reduced dependency, we're not satisfied and we're working to accelerate our diversification efforts,\u201d he said of the company's product sourcing.",
      "Ellison added that Lowe's expects to continue to be competitive on its prices.",

      "U.S. funding cuts have hit a local language learning program in Mali that empowered thousands",
      "MOUNTOUGOULA, Mali -- For Aminata Doumbia, an 18-year-old Malian, the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project was a path for her life dreams. A phrase meaning \u201cour future\u201d in the country\u2019s main local language, it refers to a yearslong program aimed at teaching around 20,000 young Malians to read and write in their local languages.",
      "Backed by $25 million in funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, over five years, the project has now shut down following the Trump administration's decision to cut 90% of the agency\u2019s foreign aid.",
      "\u201cThe joy I felt when I was selected for this project has been replaced by sadness,\u201d said Doumbia in Mali's capital, Bamako.",
      "She had hoped to take advantage of the empowerment program to train as a pastry chef.",
      "\u201dI don\u2019t have any hope of realizing my dream (again),\" Doumbia said.",
      "Doumbia is among thousands of people who now find themselves stranded in Mali, a country ravaged by high poverty and insecurity levels and where 70% of the population of at least 22 million people haven\u2019t had the opportunity to learn to read and write, according to Sylla Fatoumata Ciss\u00e9, director of a government agency focusing on nonformal education and national languages in Mali.",
      "The USAID funding cut also came at a time when Mali\u2019s other development partners in Europe have withdrawn their support in the aftermath of the 2021 coup, which brought the current junta leader, Assimi Goita, to power.",
      "For many, the literacy project was the only path to literacy and empowerment.",
      "Once literate, program beneficiaries move on to the next stage, which involves the acquisition of vocational skills like hairdressing, carpentry, sewing, welding, and pastry-making, according to Modibo Sissoko, literacy supervisor at the Malian Association for Survival in the Sahel nonprofit involved in the \u201cShifin ni Tagne\u201d project.",
      "These skills enable the economically disadvantaged to create jobs for themselves, earn a living or support their families, Sissoko said.",
      "\u201cWith the teaching of mother tongues, it\u2019s possible to move quickly towards mass literacy among the population,\u201d said Issiaka Ballo, a professor and researcher in native languages at Mali's University of Bamako.",
      "On the other hand, \"only 30% of the population has been educated in French,\u201d the common language in the country, he added.",
      "USAID\u2019s involvement in Mali had made it the primary development partner of the government. The abrupt end of its assistance hit not only the literacy programs, but also others designed to increase adult education and expand the literacy project to public schools.",
      "The Gaoussou Dabo School in the Malian capital, Bamako, is among 1,000 schools that benefited from mother-tongue education thanks to funding from USAID.",
      "Teachers trained for the program last year continue to teach, but the monitoring and evaluation aspect of the program has been withdrawn.",
      "The funding cut was \"a big shock for us,\u201d said Amadi Ba, a counsellor at the Pedagogical Animation Center, which is in charge of the school in Bamako.",
      "In a country where local language-education relies solely on funding from Mali\u2019s development partners with little to no help from the government, concerns exceed its immediate impact on the education of children.",
      "In 2023, Mali's military government decided to make the country\u2019s native tongues the official languages in place of French, which then became the \u201cworking language.\u201d Official documents, including the constitution, the mining code and other texts, were then translated into the national languages.",
      "The USAID cut will \"certainly have a negative impact on the development of mother-tongue education, especially since it came in the middle of the school year,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had time to think about a mechanism to cushion the blow,\u201d she added.",
      "While it lasted, the program was beneficial to many in various ways.",
      "Oumou Traor\u00e9, a mother of two who grows onions and eggplants for a living, recalled how the training improved her farming business, particularly in pricing her goods in Bamako's Mountougoula district.",
      "\u201cSince I learned to calculate the weight of my onions and keep my accounts in my mother tongue, I\u2019ve started selling my onions myself,\u201d said Traore, 29. \u201cI now earn $95 instead of the $60 I used to get. This has encouraged me to grow other vegetables.\u201d",
      "The 2021 coup resulted in the country turning to Russia as a key ally after severing ties with the West, including the U.S., which at some point was Mali's leading foreign aid donor.",
      "While some experts have said the withdrawal of U.S. aid may open the door for rivals such as Russia, whose mercenaries have been accused of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings in the country, some say USAID has left a hole too large to be filled by others.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult to find takers for the projects left behind by USAID,\u201d said Fatimata Tour\u00e9, a development specialist and director of the Research, Study and Training Group civic group in Mali.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s exports to the United States, its largest single trading partner, fell nearly 2% in April as tariff hikes imposed by President Donald Trump hit home.",
      "Globally, exports rose just 2% year-on-year, down from 4% in March, leaving a trade deficit for the first time in three months.",
      "Imports from the United States fell more than 11% in April, while total imports slipped 2.2%.",
      "Weakening exports could drag on growth after the economy contracted 0.7% in the last quarter.",
      "Japan is asking the Trump administration to scrap his tariffs on imports from Japan, but so far, the U.S. has not agreed to do so.",
      "The Finance Ministry said April's trade deficit totaled 115.8 billion yen ($804 million), compared with 504.7 billion yen a year earlier.",
      "The Japanese yen recently has gained against the U.S. dollar, eroding the value of exports in yen terms. The dollar is trading at about 144 yen, down from about 155 yen a year ago.",
      "Exports had picked up earlier in the year as businesses rushed to beat tariffs that have gradually taken effect since Trump took office for a second time.",
      "While trade with the United States has suffered, exports to other regions such as Southeast Asia have expanded.",
      "The U.S. is charging a 25% tariff on imports of autos, a mainstay of Japan's trade with the U.S. and a key driver of growth for the economy. Trump has relaxed some of those tariffs but has kept in place higher tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Japan's vehicle exports fell nearly 6% in April from the year before.",
      "Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's main tariff negotiator, is due to visit the U.S. soon for talks, likely over the weekend, in the third round of those talks.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump isn\u2019t the only one who wrapped up a Middle East tour in recent days",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump isn't the only one who wrapped up a Middle East tour in recent days. A private jet carrying Nvidia's CEO trailed Air Force One across the region. Oil executives and bankers followed, too, as American executives dropped everything \u2014 canceling longstanding obligations and zooming into board meetings back home \u2014 to cozy up to Trump and bolster the image he tried to sell on his first major foreign trip.",
      "With Trump back in the White House, a jaunt with the president or a stop in the Oval Office is now as routine for America's business leaders as a speech to an industry conference.",
      "Corporate titans are spending more time than ever working to curry favor with the administration as part of their effort to score relief from regulations \u2014 and tariffs \u2014 from the transactional president. He, in turn, is happy to use them as supporting cast members as he tries to project the economy as booming at a time when growth is slowing.",
      "But putting in time with the U.S. president has not fully insulated companies such as Apple, Amazon, Walmart and others from Trump's anger. It's a sign that the public commitments they make to create U.S. jobs may be doing more to burnish the president's image than to protect their own profitability.",
      "In private, CEOs and executives on Trump\u2019s trip marveled at how they came to be unofficial members of the president's traveling party, their private jets hopscotching across the Gulf as Trump visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. They said they had little choice but to get close to Trump, especially as he wields his tariff powers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thinking we have a president of the United States doing the selling,\u201d Trump said in Abu Dhabi, standing alongside the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Tomislav Mihaljevic, and working in a dig at his presidential predecessor, Joe Biden. \u201cYou think Biden would be doing it? I don\u2019t think so. But I think it's so important. I have to be a cheerleader for our country.\u201d",
      "The host countries and the White House pulled together business conferences in a matter of weeks to give Trump a stage to show off his dealmaking on the trip. Business leaders signed partnership agreements and touted mutual investments almost as a performance for Trump and the region's powerful ruling elites, while using the opportunity to network and share their mutual bemusement that this was now part of their job portfolio.",
      "Trump has demonstrated that he steers business to those who ingratiate themselves to him \u2014 look no further than his promotion of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla \u2014 and punishes those who don\u2019t, like Amazon during Trump\u2019s first term and law firms, universities and a growing list of institutions in his second.",
      "\u201cHe wants the vanity of people coming in to kiss his ring,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, CEO of Yale University\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute. He said the behavior by CEOs, while obsequious, often resulted in better treatment and free publicity from the government.",
      "It's not just U.S. business people paying heed. On Monday, a French executive turned up in the Oval Office with Trump.",
      "The president thanked Bernard Arnault's French luxury company LVMH for the \u201cMedals of Sacrifice\u201d made by its subsidiary, Tiffany & Co., as Trump presented them to the families of three sheriff\u2019s deputies from Palm Beach County, Florida, who were killed in the line of duty.",
      "LVMH stock has fallen this year as tariffs threaten a business that sells everything from designer handbags to champagne. But Trump had only the fondest of praise as he told Arnault's son, Alexandre, who was representing the company: \"Thank you very much, Alexandre. I appreciate that you came. He came all the way from France.\"",
      "Compared to the Biden administration, CEOs and executives at America's most powerful companies have felt obligated to stay in frequent contact with Trump's team. But the contact isn't a guarantee of meaningful influence with the president.",
      "Executives at multiple companies, insisting on anonymity to describe private interactions, said it wasn't always clear who in Trump's orbit could best relay their views on tariffs, regulations and taxes to the president. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emerged as their preferred go-between, but that hasn't completely immunized the companies from attacks by Trump.",
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had a previously scheduled call on Saturday with Bessent, only to separately become the target of Trump's ire in a social media post in which the president said America's largest retailer should \u201ceat\u201d the cost of his tariffs.",
      "Trump in April called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had attended his inaugural, after a report that the online outlet was considering displaying on product listings the impact of Trump's tariffs on prices. Amazon had explored the possibility for its Amazon Haul service, which competes against China-founded discounters Temu and Shein, but had chosen not to do so.",
      "The heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis met with Trump to outline how his tariffs would disrupt automaking. Trump gave them some reprieves on domestic vehicles with foreign parts not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but he still has a 25% tax on imported steel and aluminum.",
      "The president portrayed his tariff changes last April as a temporary bridge so that automakers would increase production domestically.",
      "\u201cWe just wanted to help them during this little transition, short term,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to penalize them. \u201d",
      "Trump repeatedly praised Apple after its $500 billion commitment for investments in the United States. But the company also plans to shift more iPhone production to India in response to the China tariffs \u2014 and that has frustrated Trump.",
      "Speaking in Qatar, Trump recalled a conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook: \u201cI said to him: \u2018My friend, I treated you very good. You\u2019re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.'\u201d",
      "By contrast, JP Morgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon ended up influencing Trump's tariff policies by going on TV.",
      "The banker on April 9 was interviewed on Fox Business Network's \u201cMornings with Maria\" as financial markets were panicking because of Trump's tariffs. Dimon said markets would improve if Trump could negotiate trade agreements.",
      "\u201cTake a deep breath,\" Dimon said. \"Negotiate some trade deals. That's the best thing they can do.\u201d",
      "His statements resonated with Trump, who pulled back his tariffs later that day to a baseline 10% so that negotiations could occur for 90 days.",
      "Trump later recounted, \u201cI watched Jamie Dimon on Maria Bartiromo\u2019s show this morning, and he was very good.\"",

      "The U.S. Senate is moving forward with an effort to block California's nation-leading standards for vehicle emissions",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.",
      "California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.",
      "The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Thune said California's \u201care an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation\u2019s energy supply.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.",
      "California has some of the nation's worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.",
      "Trump rescinded California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden\u2019s administration restored it in 2022.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.",
      "The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.",
      "California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.",
      "The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.",
      "New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.",
      "Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.",
      "\u201cBanning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,\" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.",
      "The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.",
      "\u201cWhile transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,\u201d said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.",
      "Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.",
      "\u201cOur already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the vote.",
      "Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.",
      "But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.",
      "Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d",
      "Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.",
      "Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.",
      "But some of those states are already backing away.",
      "Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Around 280 Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia are demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in back wages and other money owed to them after their former employer, a plastic parts supplier to big Japanese companies, closed down.",
      "The workers at Kawaguchi Manufacturing's factory in Port Klang, Malaysia's largest port city, were left stranded when the company withheld their wages for up to eight months before shutting down late last year. The workers have filed complaints in Malaysia and back home in Bangladesh.",
      "Such disputes have become a diplomatic sore point between Bangladesh and Malaysia, drawing scrutiny on a small but powerful group of recruitment agencies and middlemen who monopolize such jobs.",
      "Asif Nazrul, an adviser to Bangladesh\u2019s expatriate welfare ministry, met with Malaysia\u2019s Home Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong in Kuala Lumpur last week. Officials were due to meet again Wednesday in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital.",
      "The interim government that took over in Bangladesh after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has placed a higher priority on the plight of migrant workers who often get trapped in debt after paying exorbitant recruitment fees to work in dismal conditions for little pay.",

      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have accelerated that trend as factories move from China to places in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere.",
      "The workers have received just 251,000 ringgit ($58,101) of the more than 3 million ringgit ($694,444) in back wages that a Malaysian labor tribunal ordered Kawaguchi to pay. Many have found new jobs but still have heavy debts after borrowing money to pay hefty recruitment fees.",
      "The workers allege they were sometimes required to work without breaks for 24-hour shifts and on holidays with no paid overtime, making plastic casings for televisions and air conditioners. They say Kawaguchi confiscated their passports, provided inadequate housing and delayed their visa renewals.",
      "The factory shut down in December, soon after Sony Group and Panasonic Holdings Corp., two of Kawaguchi's main customers, halted their orders in response to the allegations against their supplier.",
      "After the factory closed, the workers say Malaysian officials forcibly sent many of them to another city some 360 kilometers (220 miles) away to toil in new factory jobs without giving them any information. They were kept in filthy shipping containers converted into dormitories. Another 80 workers were told to work in palm oil plantations \u2014 but refused.",
      "Most made their way back to Port Klang to seek work and chip away at the debts that have been accumulating. It took nearly three months for them to get permission from the Malaysian government to switch jobs.",
      "The Associated Press got no response to multiple requests to Kawaguchi for comment. Malaysia's labor department also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Md Kabir Hossain\u2019s case is typical. The 19-year-old said he borrowed more than $4,000 to get to Malaysia from his hometown Rangpur in Bangladesh in November 2023, after his family\u2019s textile shop began to fail. The family\u2019s sole wage earner, he defaulted on one of his loans and wasn\u2019t able to send money back home, as his family struggled to keep their shop going.",

      "Another worker, Parvez Azam said he didn't know how much longer he could keep going. \u201cIf this goes on, we'll die here,\u201d he said.",
      "Factories in Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia rely on migrant workers, often from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, to fill labor-intensive jobs in manufacturing, plantations, or construction that local workers won't perform for the wages offered.",
      "The cost of recruitment and migration from Bangladesh to Malaysia is among the most expensive in the world, according to the International Labor Organization\u2019s office in Bangladesh.",
      "The official recruitment fee is about $650 per worker. But all the workers at Kawaguchi said they paid nearly $5,000. The loans they took to pay such sums has pushed them into debt bondage as they labor to pay off ever mounting debts.",
      "In 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia should end use of recruitment agents, describing the system as \u201cmodern slavery.\u201d But a 2024 study of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia found that more than 70% had spent at least half of their wages to pay off recruitment debts. Most have at least two loans and many said they were misled about their wages.",
      "Nearly everyone who migrates overseas from Bangladesh, one of the countries most affected by climate change, has suffered at least one form of modern slavery, like withholding of wages or physical violence, according to a study by the London-based think tank International Institute for Environment and Development.",
      "Mohamad Mohosin, 38, said he moved to Malaysia when his crops failed because of extreme weather. After going months without being paid his debt has spiraled, forcing his large family in Bangladesh to borrow still more money. \u201cMy family is in trouble,\u201d he said.",
      "Among migrant workers, Bangladeshis often end up in the riskiest jobs, such as plantation work where they can catch mosquito-borne diseases, or physically demanding factory or construction roles, where the likelihood of accidents is higher, said Shariful Islam Hasan of BRAC.",
      "\u201cDespite the high risk and the high migration cost, salaries are too low,\u201d he said.",
      "Panasonic, Sony and Daikin, three of Kawaguchi's former main customers among about a dozen, agreed to cover an estimated $1.3 million of the recruitment costs paid by the workers. It\u2019s unclear how much each company is contributing.",
      "\"This doesn't cover all the workers' costs, including interest rates of up to 30% they must pay on their loans,\" said Andy Hall, a British labor activist who has been helping the workers. Many have also defaulted on their debts after going months without wages.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely desperate and they\u2019re at very high risk of falling into even worse situations,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Daikin settled with the workers, agreeing to pay them more, although it says it accounted for only 1% to 2% of Kawaguchi's orders. The air conditioner manufacturer told AP it was working with human rights groups to resolve any remaining issues.",
      "Panasonic said it was \u201cproportionally reimbursing the recruitment fees\u201d paid by workers and had asked Kawaguchi to correct labor violations. It said it tried to support Kawaguchi but had to disengage from the company due to its financial woes and anticipated production problems.",

      "Leading financial officials from the world\u2019s richest countries are gathering in a Canadian mountain resort this week for what may prove a contentious meeting in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs",
      "BANFF, Canada -- Leading financial officials from the world's richest countries are gathering in a Canadian mountain resort this week for what may prove a contentious meeting in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The annual meetings of the Group of 7 finance ministers, known as the G7, are typically congenial and in previous years have produced joint commitments to combat inflation and counter the COVID pandemic. There may be less agreement this year as Trump's tariffs threaten to slow growth in many of the gathered nations, including host Canada, which Trump has also suggested become a potential 51st state.",
      "\u201cI expect it will be somewhat of a testy conversation among the G7 officials,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and former top official at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThis is a very difficult period for the relationships among the G7 countries.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has reached an initial trade deal with one G7 member, the United Kingdom, and is engaged in talks with Japan and the European Union. But Canada still faces 25% duties on many of its exports to the United States, including autos, and the other three G7 members \u2014 France, Germany, and Italy \u2014 all face a baseline tariff of 10% on all their exports as part of the European Union.",
      "It will be the first formal meeting of the G7 attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who participated in a brief G7 gathering last month on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, D.C. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will also attend along with central bank governors from the other G7 nations.",
      "\u201cThe message from colleagues is pretty clear is that a free and fair and a rules-based multilateral trading system, is a system in which we all win,\u201d Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s minister of finance, said Tuesday.",
      "While many finance ministers gathered in Banff this week will likely seek one-on-one meetings with Bessent, it's unlikely any trade deals will be reached, according to a person briefed on preparations for the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have authorization to speak about it publicly.",
      "Instead, the finance officials will seek to smooth the way toward any agreements before a meeting of the heads of state of the G7 countries in June in nearby Kananaskis, Canada.",
      "Bessent may be able to bring a more conciliatory tone to the meetings, Prasad said, as he is often seen as a relatively moderating influence on tariffs in the Trump White House.",
      "And there will likely be some areas of agreement, particularly around the Trump administration's goal to address what it calls \u201cglobal imbalances\u201d in world trade, a reference to the United States' large annual trade deficits, which reflects that it imports more than it exports. The White House sees China as the key driver of such imbalances. China has a large trade surplus.",
      "\u201cIntentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America\u2019s manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk,\u201d Bessent said in a speech last month during the IMF and World Bank meetings.",
      "The status of the U.S. dollar may also come up, at least in informal conversations. The dollar dropped in value unexpectedly last month after Trump unveiled his widespread tariffs, while the interest rate on Treasury bonds rose, a sign international investors may have been dumping American assets as confidence in the country's governance and economy eroded.",
      "\u201cIn the hallways, they\u2019re going to talk about nothing but tariffs and the dollar,\u201d said Steven Kamin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former senior economist at the Federal Reserve.",
      "At last year's meeting of G7 finance officials in Stresa, Italy, they agreed on a joint statement that said the members have a \u201cstrong commitment to a free, fair, and rules-based\u201d trading system. It's not yet clear whether they will be able to agree on such a statement this year.",
      "Another question hanging over the meetings will be whether the G7 can come to agreement on a new round of sanctions on Russia. The European Union and U.K. announced sanctions on Russian oil Tuesday, targeting Russia's \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of unregistered oil tankers that are shipping its oil and allowing it to fund its war with Ukraine.",
      "Proposals to lower a price cap on Russian oil, set as part of earlier rounds of international sanctions, down from its current level of $60 may also be discussed in meetings Wednesday.",
      "Yet the Trump administration, while it has called for greater sanctions on Russian oil, hasn't yet signed on to the new restrictions. Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, and said the two countries would soon begin ceasefire talks, though no details were available.",
      "Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko will also attend the G7 meetings this week, though Ukraine is not a member.",
      "Daleep Singh, chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former deputy national security adviser in the Biden administration, said the issue of Russian oil sanctions will be a key test of what unity remains in the G7.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something to engender a just and lasting peace, oil sanctions are the place to look,\u201d he said.",

      "Japan\u2019s agriculture minister has resigned because of political fallout over his comment that he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because he got it from supporters as gifts",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's agriculture minister was forced to resign Wednesday because of political fallout over recent comments that he \u201cnever had to buy rice\u201d because he got it from supporters as gifts. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food.",
      "Taku Eto's comment, which many Japanese saw as out of touch with economic realities, came at a seminar Sunday for the Liberal Democratic Party, which leads an struggling minority government. The gaffe could be further trouble for the party before a national election in July. A major loss could mean a new government or could mean Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba would have to step down.",
      "\u201cI made an extremely inappropriate remark at a time when consumers are struggling with soaring rice prices,\u201d Eto told reporters after submitting his resignation at the prime minister\u2019s office. Eto's resignation was the first under Ishiba's leadership that began October.",
      "The government has released tons of rice from its emergency stockpile in recent months, but the latest agricultural ministry statistics show little impact from the move. Some supermarkets have started selling cheaper imported rice.",
      "Eto also sought to clarify the comments that got him in trouble. He said he does actually buy white rice himself and was not living on rice given as gifts. He said the gift comment referred to brown rice, which he wants people to become interested in because it can reach market faster.",
      "Ishiba appointed popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, to lead the ministry, noting his experience in agriculture and fisheries policies and enthusiasm for reforms.",
      "Koizumi told reporters Ishiba instructed him to do everything to stabilize the rice supply and prices to address consumer concern.",
      "\u201cI was told to put rice before anything,\u201d Koizumi told reporters. \u201cAt this difficult time, I will do utmost to speedily tackle high rice price that people feel and worry in everyday life.\u201d He said he shares consumers' concerns as he feeds his children packaged instant rice sometimes.",
      "Ishiba, also a former farm minister, said he wants to strengthen Japan\u2019s food security and self-sufficiency. He has proposed agricultural reforms, including increased rice production and possible exports, though critics say he should urgently fix the ongoing rice problem first.",
      "Noting the rice situation, Ishiba said he suspects the rice price surge is \u201cnot a temporary but a structural problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may not be easy to find an answer,\u201d he said, but repeated his pledge to do the utmost to ease consumers' difficulties and to reform rice policies.",
      "Koizumi said the measures so far have proved ineffective and that he will speed the effort as soon as he formally takes office later Wednesday.",
      "Party leaders plan to further grill Ishiba at a party leaders' debate at parliament scheduled later in the day.",
      "Japanese rice demand has decreased over recent decades as people's diets have diversified, but rice remains a staple food and integral part of Japanese culture and history.",
      "\u201cRice is the stable food for the Japanese. When its prices are rising every week, (Eto's) resignation is only natural,\u201d said Shizuko Oshima, 73.",
      "The shortfall started last August on panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake. The supply pressure eased after the autumn harvest, but a shortage and price increases hit again early this year.",
      "Officials have blamed the supply shortage on poor harvests because of hot weather in 2023 and higher fertilizer and other production costs, but some experts blame the government\u2019s long-term rice production policy.",
      "The unprecedented release from emergency rice stockpiles was seen in part as an attempt to figure out distribution problems. The government has denied there is now a rice shortage, but officials say it's a mystery why rice is not reaching consumers. Some experts say the rice shortage could be serious but it's difficult to trace rice as its distribution route has become so complex since the end of government control in 1995.",

      "Businesses face uncertainty after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip legal protections from 350,000 Venezuelans",
      "DORAL, Fla. -- As a business owner in the largest Venezuelan community in the United States, Wilmer Escaray is stressed and in shock. He is unsure what steps he should take after the Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "Escaray owns 15 restaurants and three markets, most of them in Doral, a city of 80,000 in the Miami area people known as \u201cLittle Venezuela\u201d or \u201cDoralzuela.\" At least 70% of Escaray's 150 employees and many of his customers are Venezuelan immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, also known as TPS.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a federal judge\u2019s ruling that had paused the administration\u2019s plans to end TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The Department of Homeland Security welcomed the ruling but has given no details on when TPS is ending and what employers and beneficiaries should do.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration does not rest on its laurels. We will act in an expeditious manner,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary, said Tuesday in a written response to questions about any expiration date for TPS after the court ruling and whether work permits were still valid.",
      "Like many U.S. business owners with Venezuelan employees, Escaray does not know how long his employees will have legal authorization to work or whether he will be able to help them.",
      "\u201cThe impact for the business will be really hard,\u201d said Escaray, a 37-year-old Venezuelan American who came to the U.S. to study in 2007 and opened his first restaurant six years later. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet what I am going to do. I have to discuss with my team, with my family to see what will be the plan.\u201d",
      "TPS allows people already in the U.S. to legally live and work here because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife. The Trump administration said immigrants were poorly vetted after the Biden administration dramatically expanded the designation.",
      "Immigration attorney Evelyn Alexandra Batista said the Supreme Court did not specifically address TPS-based work permits, and some work authorizations remain in effect. She warned, though, that there is no guarantee that they will remain valid because the Supreme Court could change this.",
      "\u201cThis means that employers and employees alike should be exploring all other alternative options as TPS was never meant to be permanent,\u201d said Batista, who has received hundreds of calls from TPS beneficiaries and companies looking for advice in the months since Trump returned to office and began his immigration crackdown.",
      "Among the options they are exploring, she said, are visas for people with extraordinary abilities, for people who make investments and for agricultural workers.",
      "Many TPS holders have requested asylum or other immigration benefits. It\u2019s not clear if people with pending requests will be allowed to stay in the U.S.",
      "Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Tuesday condemned the withdrawal of TPS for Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "\u201cTPS was a minimal protection they had. Now it\u2019s been taken away from them,\u201d Maduro said in a televised government event.",
      "The American Business Immigration Coalition estimates that TPS holders add $31 billion to the U.S. economy through wages and spending power. There are no specific estimates of the impact of Venezuelans, although they make up the largest percentage of TPS beneficiaries.",
      "They work in hospitality, construction, agriculture, health care, retail, and food services.",
      "\u201cThis decision leaves business owners with limited options,\u201d said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the coalition.",
      "The concerns go beyond Doral.",
      "William Paredes arrived at the U.S. in 2014 and now owns a window tinting business that employs four other Venezuelans in Tampa, about 280 miles (450 kilometers) northwest of Miami. He does not know what is next and he has no plan.",
      "\"This is my and my family\u2019s economic support,\" Paredes, 42, said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving everything in God\u2019s hands because if I think about it, I get depressed. We\u2019re in limbo.\"",
      "He and his wife and son, now 16, came to the U.S. on tourist visas and soon requested asylum. He lost his asylum case, but thought he was shield from deportation as a TPS holder. His 8-year-old daughter was born in the U.S. and is an American citizen.",
      "Paredes was a police officer in his home country and left after receiving threats for working as a security guard for a mayor who opposed the ruling socialist party. He said he cannot go back.",
      "\"I\u2019m too scared and just thinking that they might send me back to Venezuela gives me goose bumps,\" Paredes said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Levi Strauss is set to finally part ways with Dockers \u2014 inking a deal to sell its brand once credited with propelling the popularity of \u201cCasual Fridays\u201d to Authentic Brands Group.",
      "In an announcement Tuesday, the denim giant said it had agreed to sell Dockers to Authentic for up to $391 million. The transaction will start at an initial value of $311 million, with the potential of adding another $80 million to the price tag based on business performance under the new ownership.",
      "The sale arrives as San Francisco-based Levi Strauss boosts its focus on the chain\u2019s core Levi\u2019s brand \u2014 as well as Beyond Yoga, which the company acquired in 2021, as more and more consumers continue to cozy up to athleisure wear.",
      "Selling Dockers \u201cfurther aligns our portfolio with our strategic priorities,\u201d Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement, while thanking the Dockers team for their commitment to building the brand, which she said \"continues to be the authority on khaki.\u201d",

Dockers \u201cplayed a key role in shaping casual workwear as we know it today, and we see significant potential to build on that legacy and grow the brand across a variety of categories,\u201d he said.",
      "Levi Strauss launched Dockers back in 1986, and the brand soon became a \u201cCasual Friday\u201d staple. Many office workers turned to Dockers' khakis and looser button-downs in the place of more traditional business attire. While it was not the sole \u2014 or very first \u2014 creator of dressed-down office looks, Dockers has been widely-credited as an integral part to \u201cCasual Friday's\u201d rise, particularly in the 90s.",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration said Tuesday it will limit approval for seasonal COVID-19 shots to seniors and others at high risk pending more data on everyone else \u2014 raising questions about whether some people who want a vaccine this fall will be able to get one.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new standards for updated COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach to make them available to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one high-risk health problem.",
      "But the FDA framework, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. It's a stark break from the previous federal policy recommending an annual COVID shot for all Americans six months and older. In the paper and a subsequent online webcast, the FDA's top vaccine official said more than 100 million Americans still should qualify for what he termed a booster under the new guidance.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad described the new approach as a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d that will allow vaccinations in high-risk groups to continue while generating new data about whether they still benefit healthier people.",
      "\"For many Americans we simply do not know the answer as to whether or not they should be getting the seventh or eighth or ninth or tenth COVID-19 booster,\u201d said Prasad, who joined the FDA earlier this month. He previously spent more than a decade in academia, frequently criticizing the FDA's handling of drug and vaccine approvals.",
      "It's unclear what the upcoming changes mean for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The nation's leading pediatrics group said FDA's approach will limit options for parents and their children.",
      "\u201cIf the vaccine were no longer available or covered by insurance, it will take the choice away from families who wish to protect their children from COVID-19, especially among families already facing barriers to care,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 47,000 Americans died from COVID-related causes last year. The virus was the underlying cause for two-thirds of those and it was a contributing factor for the rest. Among them were 231 children whose deaths were deemed COVID-related, 134 of them where the virus was the direct cause -- numbers similar to yearly pediatric deaths from the flu.",
      "The new FDA approach is the culmination of a series of recent steps under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. scrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising questions about the broader availability of vaccines. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under Trump.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the most commonly used COVID shots, each said they would continue to work with the agency.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots so long as they show as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach, according to Prasad and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who co-authored the journal paper and joined the FDA webcast.",
      "Prasad and Makary criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all,\u201d contrasting it with some European countries that recommend boosters based on age, risk and other factors.",
      "Prasad said the FDA will ask all manufacturers to do new clinical trials in healthy people ages 50 to 64, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death. Companies might need to repeat that requirement for future vaccine approvals if there's a large virus mutation rather than the past year's incremental evolution. Companies are also free to test their vaccines for approval in younger adults and children, Prasad said, adding \u201cthis is a free country.\u201d",
      "Since becoming the nation's top health official in February, Kennedy has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, including Makary and Prasad. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Health experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended only for people at increased risk.",
      "In June, an influential panel of advisers to the CDC is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, says he\u2019ll be spending less on political campaigns",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key financial supporter of President Donald Trump, said Tuesday that he'll be spending \u201ca lot less\u201d on political campaigns, a reversal that could be a setback for Republicans ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "Musk disclosed his decision via videoconference during a Bloomberg forum in Doha, Qatar. It speaks to his possible disenchantment with politics after his tumultuous tenure as Trump's pick to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending. Musk has scaled back his government role to spend more time at his businesses, including Tesla, which have seen intense blowback. Tesla reported a big drop in profits in the first quarter.",
      "\u201cIn terms of political spending I\u2019m going to do a lot less in the future,\u201d Musk said. Asked why, he responded that \u201cI think I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d",
      "Musk's statement marks a reversal of the course he had set during the 2024 campaign \u2014 when he was among the very top political spenders \u2014 and immediately after.",
      "Musk spent at least $250 million supporting Trump in the presidential campaign, as the main contributor to America PAC, a super PAC that was active in advertising and funding door-to-door canvassing groups across the seven most-competitive states in the November presidential election.",
      "Musk relished in the publicity, campaigning alongside Trump at times and headlining some of his own campaign rallies on the GOP nominee's behalf.",
      "And while he took credit for helping Trump return to the White House, Musk suffered a public defeat in April, after he became deeply involved in a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign. Musk-backed groups America PAC and Rebuilding America's Future spent more than $21 million on the April 1 election in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel.",
      "But Schimel's defeat by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin, a state Trump carried just five months earlier, was a blow to Musk, who campaigned for Schimel in Green Bay the weekend before the election and had also pledged to enforce Trump's agenda in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "A week after Trump's November victory, Musk said the political action committees he supported would \u201cplay a significant role in primaries,\u201d adding later that he might help finance Republican challengers to GOP members of Congress who did not support Trump's nominees.",
      "\u201cHow else? There is no other way,\u201d Musk wrote on X, which he rebranded after purchasing Twitter, in response to the suggestion of supporting intraparty challenges.",
      "An adviser to Musk\u2019s PACs declined to comment Tuesday.",
      "Once Trump took office, Musk held a prominent role as an adviser and leader of DOGE. He and his acolytes in the department fanned out widely across the federal government to enact deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies altogether.",
      "DOGE has pushed to fire tens of thousands of workers in downsizing at agencies, ranging from the IRS to Health and Human Services, and pressured tens of thousands more to take buyout and early retirement offers. And they sought to shut down agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "With backing from DOGE, agencies have cancelled tens of thousands of government contracts and grants that they say do not align with the administration\u2019s priorities. Some of those moves were done so quickly that they had to be reversed after pushback or court rulings finding that they were illegal.",
      "Critics say it amounts to a reckless chain-saw approach that could destroy much of the nation\u2019s apolitical civil service, impair services for vulnerable populations, and halt critical research.",
      "DOGE claims on its \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d it has saved an estimated $170 billion, but those savings numbers have been shown to be flawed and inflated in many cases.",
      "Musk's role prompted intense pushback, including protests at his electric vehicle company, Tesla. Speaking to reporters earlier this month as he prepared to step back from DOGE, Musk noted the backlash.",
      "\u201cBeing attacked relentlessly is not super fun,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing cars burning is not fun,\u201d he added, referring to the instances of Tesla cars being smashed or set on fire.",
      "Musk's announced intention to step back from political spending comes during multiple new business opportunities, including a deal to host the latest versions of his Grok artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft\u2019s data centers.",
      "Meanwhile, his brain-computer interface company Neuralink is planning to implant its experimental devices in dozens more people and his electric-vehicle company Tesla is developing a humanoid robot that Musk hopes to one day send to Mars.",
      "Musk could change his mind about campaign spending. The 2026 midterm campaigns are just getting off the ground, while some candidates have not yet announced their candidacy for elections that remain 18 months away.",
      "But as of Tuesday, Musk said he did not expect to.",
      "\u201cWell, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said. \"I do not currently see a reason.\u201d",

      "The new measures are not obviously linked to Russian delays in agreeing to a ceasefire. Work on the measures began in the days after the last package was finalized three months ago.",

      "Ratings agency S&P Global and the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, a think tank, have put the number at over 400 ships that can transport oil, or products made from crude such as diesel fuel and gasoline.",
      "Vessels from the shadow fleet have also come under suspicion of damaging undersea cables, particularly in the Baltic Sea. Finnish police on Dec. 26 seized the Eagle S, a tanker they said was part of the dark fleet, on suspicion it used its anchor to damage the Estlink 2 undersea power cable that supplies electricity from Finland to Estonia.",
      "The EU also said that it targeted people and companies, including an insurer, that make it possible for the shadow fleet to operate, hitting interests in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Hong Kong.",
      "In parallel, the U.K. targeted the shadow fleet in a raft of 100 new sanctions that it said are aimed at \u201cramping up pressure\u201d on the Kremlin.",

      "It added that the sanctions will target the supply chains of Russian weapons, including Iskander missiles which have been fired into civilian areas in Ukraine during the war. The U.K. will also sanction 18 more ships in the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d carrying Russian oil.",

      "\u201cWhen you go into high schools and you go into elementary schools often times we\u2019ll hear narratives around basketball players, football games, those things,\u201d Hawkins said. \"And golf is really not as propagated as much for our community.\u201d",
      "In Detroit, advocates of increasing play among Black young people have partnered with some of the city's largest businesses and community organizations. At least two nonprofits offer programs that teach kids how to play golf.",
      "The Rocket Classic has steered nearly $10 million from the annual PGA event held in Detroit to local charitable organizations. Of that, $800,000 has been given to programs that teach kids how to play the game. One program provides access to college scholarships to high school seniors, while upward of 700 children and teens take part each year in programs put on by First Tee of Greater Detroit.",
      "\u201cGolf is the why we get them there, but while we have them there we\u2019re teaching them life skills,\u201d said Carl Bentley, chief executive of First Tee of Greater Detroit, which has donated a golf simulator to the school district. \u201cLearning how to say \u2018yes sir, yes ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2014 shake a hand properly, how to start a conversation. We\u2019re teaching them life skills and then we get to putting and swinging and things like that.\"",
      "Among the 28.1 million Americans who played golf on a course in 2024, about 25% were Black, Asian or Hispanic, according to the National Golf Foundation. Interest is wider when considering those who played or followed professional golf coverage on TV, in writing or via podcasts.",
      "But Hawkins said his experience as a coach suggests Black high schoolers aren't among that audience.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hear kids talking about the latest golf shoes or the cool golf apparel,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get a badge of honor walking into your high school and you\u2019ve got the newest golf shirt.\u201d",
      "Golf and equipment can be pricey, sometimes too pricey for families struggling just to make ends meet.",
      "Detroit, which is just under 80% Black, had a median income of about $39,500 in 2023 compared to $69,100 statewide, according to the census. The city\u2019s poverty level was about 32%. Statewide, that figure was about 13.5%.",
      "A set of good golf clubs can cost a few hundred dollars or more. It's $28 for juniors to play 18 holes and use a cart weekdays at the two public golf courses in Detroit.",
      "The PGA brought its first event to Detroit in 2019, and city native Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies has been its sponsor. The company works with partners to bring the game to Detroit\u2019s youth and cover some of the costs, said Trina Scott, vice president of Civic and Community Affairs at Detroit-based Rock, which is Gilbert\u2019s family office.",
      "\u201cHow do we attract Black and brown youth into seeing (golf) as a possibility?\u201d said Scott. \u201cOne way of doing that is by making it accessible (and) also eliminating the barriers \u2014 being able to have the right clothing to go on a golf course, being able to have the clubs that you need, being able to have the skillset to be confident on the course.\u201d",
      "Mike Schuchard has about a dozen players on his Detroit Cass Tech golf team. That's about double the number from last season, but only two are considered \u201cvarsity level.\"",
      "That\u2019s not enough to compete against some suburban schools with strong golf programs.",
      "The first-year golf coach says he's trying to recruit students who are already interested in others sports.",
      "\u201cThese schools are loaded with great athletes, but they just haven\u2019t been introduced to this game, yet,\" Schuchard said.",
      "Ahmari Flowers, the senior captain on Cass Tech's golf team, agrees. He started playing the sport after his freshman year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an athletic guy and golf like came easy to me,\" said Flowers, 17. \"For an athletic person, it\u2019s still a sport, a lot of body movement and all you got to do is control that athleticism and use it to your advantage.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Joe Burrow\u2019s desire for privacy might be on the same level as his drive to be one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL",
      "CINCINNATI -- Joe Burrow's desire for privacy might be on the same level as his drive to be one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.",
      "That is why it was a surprise when Netflix announced in late March that the Cincinnati Bengals' star was going to be featured on the second season of the hit \u201cQuarterback\u201d series.",
      "After joking that they \u201ccaught me on the right day I guess,\" Burrow pointed out that Peyton Manning's involvement in the series made the opportunity too good to pass up.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for him. When that guy reaches out to you and asks you to do something, then most of the time I\u2019m going to say yeah,\u201d Burrow said of Manning. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have done it if he wasn\u2019t involved, but I have a lot of trust and faith in him to not do anything that would hurt me or the team.\u201d",
      "Even though Burrow lamented the loss of privacy after his home was broken into last December, he did make a high-profile appearance at The Met Gala in New York two weeks ago. That came on the heels of last year\u2019s appearance for Vogue at Paris Fashion Week with friend and former LSU teammate Justin Jefferson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a new experience. It was fun,\u201d Burrow said about The Met Gala. \u201cIt\u2019s about five minutes of taking pictures, and then it\u2019s just a little dinner party. So it was good people, good vibes. I was happy that I was able to go. Maybe we\u2019ll go again. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how we play it by ear.\u201d",
      "Burrow led the league with 4,918 passing yards and 43 touchdowns, but had his house broken into in December while the Bengals were in Dallas facing the Cowboys in a Monday night game.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a curveball I didn\u2019t quite expect throughout the whole process, but the people involved in it, working on it day to day, were great and weren\u2019t too intrusive,\u201d Burrow said about the break-in and how that was handled on both series.",
      "The Netflix series is a joint production between NFL Films, Manning\u2019s Omaha Productions and Patrick Mahomes\u2019 2PM Productions. Burrow and the Bengals were also part of last year\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d in-season series that focused on the AFC North.",
      "Burrow added he has screened a couple of episodes of the upcoming season of \u201cQuarterback\u201d to provide input to Manning and producers, but likely would not watch the entire series when it is released in July.",
      "Coach Zac Taylor said that despite having two series following the team and his star quarterback around late last season, the film crews did a good job blending in. Atlanta\u2019s Kirk Cousins and Detroit\u2019s Jared Goff will also be featured on the series.",
      "\u201cPart of the quarterback show is just behind the scenes playing quarterback. It\u2019s not necessarily the home life and the off field. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a little bit of that, but for the most part, it\u2019s just a respect for the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope people get an appreciation of what they go through every single day of game week and over the course of the season, and how their role can evolve.\u201d",
      "It has been a good offseason so far for Burrow. Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase \u2014 his two main playmakers \u2014 signed extensions. Burrow said he found out about it via text while attending the bachelor party of former Cincinnati defensive lineman Sam Hubbard, who recently retired.",
      "Burrow, who will be going into his sixth season, also noted this is the healthiest he has felt during an offseason program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m changing too much. Just like every year you want to get bigger, stronger, faster. Refine things you can refine. That\u2019s kind of the process every year,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve had injuries that kind of change the offseason mindset a little bit. This year I don\u2019t have any of those, and that\u2019s great, because I can focus on getting better all around and become a more well-rounded player.\u201d",
      "Burrow and the Bengals biggest focus will be getting off to a better start to the season. Cincinnati ended the season on a five-game winning streak, and just missed the playoffs with a 9-8 record after dropping its first three games and being 4-7 at its bye week.",
      "The Bengals open at Cleveland on Sept. 7 and host Jacksonville in Week 2 before a stretch of five straight games against playoff teams from last season, with three on the road.",
      "\u201cThis time of year is about the same. I would say we\u2019re working a little harder in the weight room and running. But at the end of the day, we just have to go out and play better early in the year,\" Burrow said.",
      "\"You can come up with all these different things to try to make that happen. I think playing in preseason games will help. We haven\u2019t had those discussions yet, but based on the little that we have, I imagine we\u2019ll be playing more, and I think that\u2019ll help.",
      "\"But we\u2019ll see. I think at the end of the day, we just have to take some ownership and come out of the gates and execute and play better.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Indiana native Eric Shanks can\u2019t remember exactly when the rite of passage began of traveling to Indianapolis Motor Speedway",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- As an Indiana native, Eric Shanks can\u2019t remember exactly when the rite of passage began of traveling to Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His first Indianapolis 500 memory is of the 1985 race, Danny Sullivan\u2019s \u201cSpin and Win\u201d 1985 victory, when Shanks was around 14 and had fully embraced the way his home state played such a role in American culture.",
      "\u201cI think everybody takes pride in there being a spotlight on this part of the country,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cThe Pacers are only in the playoffs when they are in the playoffs, the Colts aren\u2019t always in. But this is a guarantee every year.\u201d",
      "When he became CEO of Fox Sports in 2010, Shanks had a wish list of events he wanted for the network. Always at the top was the Indianapolis 500, a property Fox Sports finally landed this year. The network is in its first year of a new broadcast deal with IndyCar and on Sunday televises its first Indy 500.",
      "Shanks from the start has vowed the production will be the biggest of the year for Fox Sports \u2014 a lofty promise for a network that also carries the Super Bowl and the World Series, among other major sporting events.",
      "\u201cWe are going to blow the doors off of Indy. We\u2019re going to bring everything that Fox has to bear,\u201d he said.",
      "He\u2019s been relentless in pursuing his promise and has spent the first five IndyCar races of the year working out early-season glitches that ranged from an unstable graphics package, issues delivering timing and scoring, a mid-race loss of transmission, and enough bumps to drive Shanks nuts as he strives for a perfect production. The work has gone on at the same time Fox Sports televised the first 16 races of the NASCAR season, a run that culminated last Sunday night with the All-Star race.",
      "Only four of the NASCAR races were on Fox, and even with the rain-effected season-opening Daytona 500, that quartet averaged 4,986,000 viewers.",
      "Fox promised IndyCar its entire 17-race slate will be aired on broadcast \u2014 including both days of last weekend\u2019s qualifying \u2014 but the numbers have been sporadic and unable to keep pace with NASCAR.",
      "The IndyCar ratings don\u2019t bother Shanks.",
      "\u201cI think you just want to be constantly showing growth in a lot of areas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be showing growth in attendance. I\u2019m happy to hear merchandise sales are up \u2014 you\u2019ve got new sponsors coming in \u2014 you just want to show growth.\u201d",
      "Fox Sports last week made several changes to races later this season (mainly start times) to ensure IndyCar and NASCAR do not go directly head-to-hear, something that happened several times earlier this year when the network juggled both racing series. But Shanks told The Associated Press he is not considering moving IndyCar off of Fox to Fox Sports or another property if the ratings don\u2019t improve over the next few weeks.",
      "Instead, his focus is on ensuring the glitches through the first five races don\u2019t happen during the 109th running of \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d or the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cIn each race, it actually has been something different,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cYou fix one thing and then there\u2019s something else to fix. There\u2019s a lot of different systems talking to each other and we\u2019re on the receiving end of a lot of it. So we\u2019re figure it out and we\u2019re trying to do more.\u201d",
      "Fox Sports is compensating through new innovation, including the image of a \u201cghost car\u201d graphic used in qualifying that showed how a car making a run tracked against the current leader. And he\u2019s bringing in major talent for Sunday, including Tom Brady for the ceremonial \u201cFastest Seat in Sports\u201d car, which will be driven by Jimmie Johnson; Michael Strahan, Danica Patrick, Tony Stewart and Super Bowl-winning tight end Rob Gronkowski as the Snake Pit grand marshal.",
      "Fox Sports has a ton of material to work with, including a race-consuming cheating scandal involving Team Penske, the marquee team in IndyCar. It involves two-time defending winner Josef Newgarden, who is seeking to become the first driver in history to win three consecutive 500s.",
      "The first Israeli is in the field as Robert Shwartzman stunned 33 other drivers by becoming the first rookie since 1983 to win the pole. Kyle Larson is attempting to complete the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 for 1,100-miles of racing in one day. Two-time reigning series champion Alex Palou, who has won four of the first five races this season, is trying to finally add the 500 to his resume and Pato O'Ward, the most popular driver in the series, is trying to bounce back from last year's heartbreaking last-lap defeat.",
      "Shanks has used crossover since the start of the year \u2014 Fox produced three movie-production-quality commercials to introduce three IndyCar stars and all aired during the Super Bowl, one with a Brady cameo \u2014 and is using most of its network programming to promote Sunday's race.",
      "He also achieved a goal in adding a gambling element to Sunday, something he's wanted to do for months.",
      "\u201cI really want to turn the Indy 500 into more of a Kentucky Derby day from a wagering standpoint. It\u2019s hard to understand how to wager on motorsports,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Kentucky Derby day, even if you don\u2019t know anything about horse racing, you put down an exacta or a trifecta, you got win, place, show. How can we figure out how to get that type of broad attention around an event that honestly kind of feels a lot like horse racing that day?\u201d",
      "The solution was a partnership with DraftKings, which will have 20 or more trifectas that people can pick from. Fox Sports analyst James Hinchcliffe will pick one trifecta that will be promoted by Fox.",
      "\u201cI think that's element to this event, and motorsports in general, that if we can start to kind of like add that layer of interest for people, I think it can only be helpful to viewership,\u201d Shanks said.\"",

      "When Dot Richardson took over the Liberty softball program in July 2013, the coaches' offices, locker room and training room were located in double-wide trailers.",
      "\u201cWe had a rec field,\u201d recalled Richardson, a two-time Olympic gold medalist. \u201cThe previous staff had built the dugouts with cinder blocks and painted them blue. It was like a hobbit dugout. It was perfect for me, but everyone else had to bend down to get in it. Humble beginnings.\u201d",
      "Those sparse roots are part of the reason last weekend\u2019s upset of No. 1 overall seed Texas A&M is so remarkable. It gave the Flames a program-record 50 wins, saddled the Aggies with the dubious distinction of being the first top seed to fall short in NCAA Tournament regionals and \u2013 most significantly \u2013 put Liberty in the super regionals for the first time in school history.",
      "\u201cWe just played with so much to prove and a chip on our shoulder, knowing we could do it and that we believed in each other,\u201d said outfielder Paige Doerr. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that feeling.\u201d",
      "Richardson\u2019s team won 11 games in 2014, her first season at the campus in Lynchburg, Virginia. A year later, Liberty opened a new state-of-the-art stadium and notched 29 victories. By 2018, Richardson had the Flames in the NCAA regionals.",
      "Liberty is playing in the NCAA tourney for the fifth straight year. And, after coming painfully close to advancing to supers last season, the Flames took that next step, beating Texas A&M on Saturday, losing to the Aggies Sunday afternoon and then rallying for the clinching 6-5 victory in the winner-take-all final game that night.",
      "That one sent them on to face Oregon in the best-of-three super regional in Eugene starting Friday. The winner advances to the Women\u2019s College World Series starting May 29 in Oklahoma City.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done that through the years,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut this year, we\u2019ve been able to go over that hump. This team has never really focused on winning or losing. We\u2019ve focused on being the best we can be. And our best was good enough to be where we are now.\u201d",
      "This team, Richardson says, is her most talented and complete in her Liberty tenure. After having one or two hitters she confidently could pencil into her lineups her first few years coaching, Richardson said it\u2019s a daily struggle to find at-bats for all the capable hitters on this year\u2019s roster.",
      "That depth has been on display all season, as 11 players have hit multiple home runs, six have driven in at least 30 runs and six have tallied over 50 base hits, led by Rachel Roupe\u2019s outstanding year at the plate. Roupe is batting .392 with team highs in home runs (23) and RBI (73).",
      "In the circle, five pitchers have won multiple games and three have racked up over 75 strikeouts, paced by Elena Esocabar\u2019s 25-3 mark, 2.43 ERA, 15 complete games and 175 strikeouts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised where we are,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThey just play with so much freedom. That\u2019s what happens when you see great athletes play with freedom.\u201d",
      "Freedom and drive.",
      "LIberty has reached a regional final in each of the last three years. Last season, the Flames were one out away from beating Georgia and advancing to supers, but the Bulldogs hit a pair of RBI singles in the bottom of the seventh to walk off with the win.",
      "\u201cI think that the reason why we were here and why were able to win this game was because of last year,\u201d sophomore catcher Savannah Jessee said. \u201cIt left such a sour taste in our mouths that we were so close and we couldn\u2019t\u2019 get the job done last year. But we proved ourselves. We proved we could hang with anyone. I think having the confidence from being one out away last year helped us with this weekend.\u201d",
      "The Flames celebrated their historic win in the wee hours by hopping a fence at the team hotel and jumping into the pool, Roupe said. The Aggies\u2019 logo was emblazoned on the pool\u2019s floor below them and \u2013 in that moment \u2013 Liberty was atop the college softball world.",
      "It hopes to stay there this weekend in Oregon.",
      "\u201cFinally , I think people are starting to see that we don\u2019t play around,\u201d Jessee said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to take it on to the next level.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Roger Penske fired team president Tim Cindric, IndyCar managing director Ron Ruzewski and IndyCar general manager Kyle Moyer on Wednesday in the wake of an Indianapolis 500 cheating scandal.",
      "\u201cNothing is more important than the integrity of our sport and our race teams,\u201d Penske said in a statement. \u201cWe have had organizational failures during the last two years, and we had to make necessary changes. I apologize to our fans, our partners and our organization for letting them down.\u201d",
      "Penske is owner of the three-car team, IndyCar, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy 500. He has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times.",
      "Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and teammate Will Power were found to have an illegally modified part on their cars ahead of Sunday\u2019s final round of qualifications for the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.",
      "Neither was allowed to qualify and both on Monday were dropped to the back of the field and will start 32nd and 33rd. Rival teams have been arguing it is not enough since it's the second cheating scandal in two seasons and illegal cars potentially bumped Jacob Abel of Dale Coyne Racing from the field.",
      "Cindric and Ruzewski had already been suspended by IndyCar for the race and both teams fined $100,000. It is the second consecutive year they were suspended from \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d",
      "The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout on Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused it of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and reduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.",
      "Further investigation showed Newgarden's winning car from last year that is displayed in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum has the same illegal modification, as did the car Team Penske brought to the White House last month. Rivals claim to have photos indicating the modification has been in place for some time.",
      "What made the outrage even greater that is was just one year ago that Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and Penske \u2014 suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.",
      "Cindric is the biggest name to fall in this scandal. He\u2019s a member of the Team Penske Hall of Fame and has been with the organization since 2000 as President of Penske Racing Inc. He's been long assumed to be Penske's successor on the racing part of Penske's empire.",
      "Cindric was elevated to the role of President of Penske Performance in 2005 and, until February, essentially ran the day-to-day operations of all of Penske\u2019s racing properties.",
      "But Penske\u2019s right-hand man in February was stripped of most of his roles although he said he chose to step back as the overall leader of the organization. He remained president of the IndyCar program.",
      "Cindric is the father of NASCAR driver Austin Cindric.",

      "The PTPA sued the WTA women's tour, the ATP men's tour, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), which oversees anti-doping and anti-corruption efforts in the sport, in March, calling them a \u201ccartel.\u201d",
      "The players are seeking a greater share of revenues and also raised various other complaints about how tennis is structured, including limits on prize money and a lack of competition from rival tours or tournaments.",
      "The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil with the aim of representing players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport.",
      "The group's executive director, Ahmad Nassar, repeatedly has said it is not a full-fledged union, does not have members and does not collect dues \u2014 all of which are pointed to in one of Tuesday's motions as reasons why the PTPA does not have standing as a plaintiff in the case.

      "\u201cThere is nothing surprising in their motions,\u201d the PTPA said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve researched all the issues at length, before filing our case, and look forward to responding in due course and having the judge decide.\u201d",

      "IndyCar teams have spent the past year trying to learn everything they can about the hybrid engines introduced midway through last season",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference \u2014 a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed \u2014 the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar's novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.",
      "Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?",
      "\u201cThere is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,\u201d acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it's quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.\u201d",
      "The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.",
      "The result was finally unveiled before last year's Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.",
      "The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year's IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.",
      "But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.",
      "\u201cI've had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it's going to be at Indianapolis,\u201d IndyCar president Doug Boles said. \"I asked why and they say, 'Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are \u2014 especially in qualifying \u2014 any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see some exciting racing,\" Boles continued, \"and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.\u201d",
      "It hasn't gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.",
      "For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.",
      "\u201cThat's a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,\u201d two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, \u2018Hey, guys, we\u2019re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,' I bet they would all go, \u2018OK, this drives differently.\u2019 And now we have to counteract it.\u201d",
      "Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing's Marcus Armstrong said, \u201cI do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.\u201d",
      "Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.",
      "Then there's the fact that the hybrid unit \u2014 while mostly reliable \u2014 is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay's hybrid didn't work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.",
      "Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing\u201d on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.",
      "\u201cI think it definitely adds some variables,\u201d said Dixon, who will start on the second row. \"If you're sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest thing that we\u2019ve probably all learnt so far, you\u2019ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "George Pickens is joining CeeDee Lamb as the new 1-2 punch at receiver for Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- By the time Dak Prescott got to his phone after the Dallas Cowboys agreed to a trade for receiver George Pickens, the star quarterback said he had about six missed calls from owner Jerry Jones' assistant.",
      "\u201cLiterally no idea what it could\u2019ve been about and actually had a voicemail from Jerry, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got some good news I want to share with you,\u2019\u201d Prescott said Tuesday. \u201cSo I called him back and he was excited. Just a lot of excitement from the both of us.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys entered the offseason after the end of a three-year playoff run knowing they lacked a proven No. 2 receiver behind CeeDee Lamb. Then they skipped the position altogether in the draft.",
      "In their mind, they still don't have a No. 2 receiver. Dallas thinks it has two No. 1s after giving the Pittsburgh Steelers a third-round pick in next year's draft while the teams swapped late-round 2027 choices in the deal announced May 7.",
      "\u201cI think CeeDee said it best,\u201d first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \u201cI saw his comments where we don\u2019t have a one, we don\u2019t do A\u2019s and B\u2019s, we think that there\u2019s a one over there. If you look over there, there\u2019s a one there. So I think that\u2019s the way that we view (Pickens).\u201d",
      "Prescott, Lamb and Pickens are on the field together for the first time this week in organized team activities.",
      "\u201cWe can complement each other,\u201d Lamb said of Pickens. \u201cJust being his backbone and being here for him and letting him know that he has some help on the other side that\u2019s a dog and that\u2019s willing to win. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to do that.\u201d",
      "Going into his 10th season, Prescott potentially has the most dangerous second option at receiver since Amari Cooper was traded three years ago, back when Lamb was considered the No. 2 guy.",
      "After finishing second in MVP voting in 2023, Prescott missed the final nine games last season with a torn hamstring. Now he has plenty of reasons to feel confident about a reset coming off just the second losing season for Dallas since he became the starter.",
      "\u201cLooking at the guy\u2019s tape, you see what he does, the kind of receiver he is, he\u2019s going to win on one on ones,\u201d Prescott said of Pickens. \u201cHe can win two vs. one if he has to. Very, very talented guy. When you can add him alongside a CeeDee and the rest of the weapons we have, I\u2019m super excited.\u201d",
      "Pickens left behind questions in Pittsburgh, where the 2022 second-round pick showed he could be a dynamic playmaker but struggled to keep his emotions in check. Lamb has had a few sideline moments himself, usually when frustrated that he wasn't getting the ball enough.",
      "\u201cObviously just watching him with the Steelers and how passionate he is about the game, I think they kind of get it confused when you\u2019re so passionate about something, you\u2019re willing to do anything for it,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cAs far as winning goes, just being happy in an organization. Not saying that he wasn\u2019t, not saying that he was, you never know. He hasn\u2019t stopped smiling since he got here, so I\u2019ll start with that.\u201d",
      "Pickens now has had a chance to show people from the outside that smile after dealing with most of the questions about his three-year Pittsburgh tenure by phone.",
      "\u201cI'd probably say staying humble,\u201d Pickens said when asked about a chance for a fresh start. \u201cThat's kinda what I always did even when the story was what the story was. I always kept working and staying humble.\u201d",
      "Lamb will go through a full offseason and training camp with Pickens after missing everything in a contract holdout last year. He played through a painful shoulder injury most of last season and experienced for the first time a season in which his catches, yards and touchdowns weren't higher than the previous year.",
      "Of course, it would have been difficult to match his first All-Pro season in 2023, when Lamb led the NFL with 135 catches and had 1,749 yards receiving and 12 touchdowns. While heaping praise on Pickens, Lamb offered a subtle reminder of his own credentials.",
      "\u201cThe last time I had OTAs and training camp,\u201d Lamb said, \u201cwas 2023.\u201d",

      "Carter Verhaeghe and Aaron Ekblad scored two tone-setting first-period goals while Sergei Bobrovsky remained strong in net as the Panthers beat the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 in Tuesday night's opener of their Eastern Conference final series.",
      "A.J. Greer added a goal by finishing off a perfect 2-on-1 transition chance in the second period for Florida, while Sam Bennett added a third-period score that erased any lingering doubt \u2014 only to see Eetu Luostarinen add another one late to make it 5-1 and keep pouring it on.",
      "\u201cWe love to win, of course,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, that\u2019s why we put in all these hours. That\u2019s why we do the hard things that are necessary to win. It\u2019s because we love it that much. We have one goal in mind and that\u2019s going to be our focus the whole way.\"",
      "Bobrovsky held up with 31 saves, including during a stretch in which the Panthers failed to get a shot on goal for more than 15 minutes spanning the second intermission. It came 48 hours after the Panthers had beaten Toronto in a road Game 7 to advance and set up a rematch of the Eastern final from two years ago.",
      "Florida swept that one with four one-goal margins, including Game 1 in four overtimes. And just as before, the Panthers have immediately ripped home-ice advantage from a team that was 5-0 at home in these playoffs.",
      "\u201cI think we didn't love our game,\u201d Verhaeghe said. \u201cWe liked our game, obviously anytime you win in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Sebastian Aho tallied Carolina's lone score when the outcome was in doubt, with Seth Jarvis' pass banging off Aho's right skate to slide under Bobrovsky in the dying seconds of the first to make it 2-1. But Florida got Greer's finish off a backhand feed from Niko Mikkola to beat Frederik Andersen to push the margin back to two goals early in the second.",
      "Andersen had been elite in the postseason, but found himself alone with Verhaeghe at the edge of the crease for a quick power-play goal that beat him to the upper right corner. He was later shielded by Brad Marchand on Bennett's score, which fittingly ended the 15-minute stretch without a shot on goal.",
      "Those both came with the man advantage, a glaring stat against Carolina's penalty kill that had been the postseason's best by allowing two goals on 30 attempts through two rounds.",
      "\u201cWhen they got the two power-play goals, I think that's really the difference in the game,\" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. \"You've got to kill those. You've got to give them credit; when they get a chance it's in the net. ... They play a heavy, hard game, but they can score.\"",
      "Jackson Blake scored a late goal for Carolina in a finish that included Marchand being tossed for a game-misconduct penalty \u2014 including being escorted off by an official while shouting back toward center ice \u2014 after a tussle with Carolina's Shayne Gostisbehere.",
      "The loss marked Carolina's 13th straight in a conference final, going back being swept in 2009, 2019 and 2023.",
      "Game 2 is back at Carolina on Thursday night.",

      "Emily Clark scored at 2:47 of overtime on Tuesday night to lead the Ottawa Charge to a 2-1 win over the Minnesota Frost",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Emily Clark was just hoping for a shorter overtime.",
      "After experiencing quadruple overtime in her team\u2019s tough semifinal series, the Ottawa Charge forward was keen to put an end to things early.",
      "Clark did just hat, scoring at 2:47 of overtime on Tuesday night to lead the Charge to a 2-1 win over the Minnesota Frost for a 1-0 lead in the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League best-of-five championship series for the Walter Cup.",
      "\u201cI had an opportunity the shift before with some speed and the puck kind of rolled off my stick and, you know, I was just trying to shake that off,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I just had in my mind that if I have another opportunity I was just going to try to use my speed and get it to the net. Obviously, happy with the result.\u201d",
      "Game 2 is Thursday in Ottawa.",
      "Ottawa is a perfect 3-0 on home ice through the playoffs. The Frost have never won Game 1 of a playoff series in four attempts.",
      "Minnesota also lost the first game of their semifinal series to Toronto and came back to win three straight.",
      "\u201cWe know it\u2019s gonna be a tight series,\u201d Frost coach Ken Klee said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team. We know goals are gonna come at a premium and, obviously, they got one more than us tonight.\u201d",
      "In the extra period, Clark came down the wing and wired a shot past Nicole Hensley, who finished the game with 17 saves.",
      "The game required extra time after Gwyneth Philips had a rare miscue early in the third period, leading to the Frost\u2019s tying goal.",
      "Philips, who stopped 25 shots, mishandled the puck while attempting to play it, turning it over to Katy Knoll. Knoll quickly fed a pass to Klara Hymlarova, who buried the wide-open chance to tie the score 1-1.",
      "\u201cYou know, those little missteps are going to happen,\u201d Charge coach Carla MacLeod said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality of sport. That\u2019s the reality of hockey. There\u2019s little mistakes that can occur, but she doesn\u2019t let it faze her, and we know that about her, too.\u201d",
      "With 6:08 remaining in regulation the Charge were set to go on the power play but officials then reviewed an incident that saw Rebecca Leslie cross check Mellissa Channell-Watkins. It was initially assessed as a major but then downgraded to a minor creating offsetting minors.",
      "\u201cI was definitely freaking out a little bit,\u201d admitted Leslie, as she waited for the call. \u201cI was disappointed, and don\u2019t like to be in those situations. So, just glad it was a minor and we killed it off.\u201d",
      "Leslie had brought the crowd to its feet midway through the second period when she beat Hensley high glove side to give Ottawa a 1-0 lead.",
      "Moments earlier the Frost had been generating a number of chances on the power play, but Philips was solid. As the penalty was expiring the Charge were able to clear the puck with Jocelyne Larocque making a cross-ice pass to Tereza Vanisova who dropped a pass to Leslie.",
      "Hensley couldn\u2019t get a clear view of the shot, partially screened by her teammate Lee Stecklein.",
      "\u201cI think that this league is unbelievably hard to score in, and I think you work all season to try to put yourself in opportunities to score goals,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cAnd those are some pretty big goals for me, and I think it does help my confidence a little bit.\u201d",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",

    "story": [
      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-old makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites",
      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "Hong Kong-traded shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, have jumped after the company raised around $4.6 billion in the biggest initial public offering globally this year",
      "HONG KONG -- Shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.",
      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",
      "In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is \u201cNingde Era.\"",
      "CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.",
      "Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn\u2019t seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.",
      "The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.",
      "The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.",
      "CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals\u2019 $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",

The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "European Union regulators say they\u2019ll seek feedback on Microsoft\u2019s latest proposed changes to Teams to ease competition concerns",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",
      "The Commission said Friday that it will now seek feedback on fresh commitments Microsoft has made to resolve the competition worries. That includes making the Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software packages available at a discount without Teams, and letting customers switch between packages without Teams. The company is also promising to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams and for users to move their data from Teams to to competing products.",
      "The commission said in a press release that it \u201cinvites all interested parties to submit their views\" on Microsoft's proposals. If everyone is satisfied, they would become legally binding.",
      "The Redmond, Wash.-based company is \u201chopeful\u201d the Commission will \u201cin the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,\" Microsoft s vice president in charge of European government affairs, Nanna-Louise Linde, said in a blog post.",
      "Microsoft's commitments would be in force for up to 10 years, the Commission said. The company could incur fines worth up to 10% of its annual global revenues \u2014 which could run into tens of billions of euros \u2014 if it fails to honor them",
      "The Teams investigation dates back to 2020, when Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint.",
      "Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, alleged that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws \u2014 by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.",
      "Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said the latest announcement \u201caffirms that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy. We will carefully scrutinize Microsoft\u2019s proposed commitments.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence",
      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

It states land can be expropriated in the public interest and in most cases must be subject to compensation, the amount of which must have been agreed to by the owners or approved by court.

    "story": [
      "The meeting comes as GOP leaders scramble to advance the bill.",
      "A last-minute White House meeting between President Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican holdouts on Wednesday afternoon comes as the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act\" appears to be in big, bad trouble.",
      "The critical meeting, which includes the House Freedom Caucus, comes as GOP leaders are scrambling to get the bill back on track after negotiations went south with hard-liners overnight. The GOP is far from unified around the bill with several sticking points among Republican hard-liners primarily regarding Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions.",
      "On his way to the high-stakes meeting at the White House, Johnson said the megabill is \"moving right along, on schedule\" and he's \"optimistic\" it will pass by the end of this week.",
      "House leadership sources tell ABC News that Johnson is keen to put the megabill on the floor Wednesday night to try to force holdouts to pick a side. But, hard-liners are balking, pledging to vote no and kill the momentum of the bill, which has changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, immigration policy and more.",
      "Asked why hard-liners still aren't listening to repeated pleas from Trump and Johnson to get behind this legislation, Johnson said \"they are.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of listening and a lot of discussion. It's been very productive. The guys that still have concerns, we're working through,\" he said.",
      "Still holdouts have been critical of the bill over concerns that it will add to the national deficit.",
      "All eyes will be on Trump to see if he can move the needle and convince the holdouts to change their positions. Wednesday's meeting comes a day after he spoke to Republicans on Capitol Hill in an effort to persuade them to back his signature bill -- at one point threatening to primary those who vote against it.",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget released a letter Wednesday afternoon calling for the passage of the bill, saying that failure to pass it \"would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "\"The House of Representatives should immediately pass this bill to show the American people that they are serious about 'promises made, promises kept,'\" the letter said.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to keeping his promise, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal,\" the letter added.",
      "Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, a holdout, said that \"we're doing what the president wants us to do,\" but insisted that the bill isn't \"done yet\" as negotiations drag on.",
      "\"We're trying to sit at the table,\" Rep. Chip Roy, another holdout, told reporters Wednesday morning at the Capitol after another meeting with the speaker. \"We're going to work with our colleagues, work with the White House, to continue to deliver what the president campaigned on and what we all campaigned on.\"",
      "Members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus members were cagey with reporters about their exact requests. Some want steeper cuts to Medicaid while others push to eliminate subsidies left over from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is this has massive savings in the first five years, and it has massive deficits of the first five years because we're not addressing the structural reforms that we're talking about right here,\" Roy said. \"No more. Now's the time for transformative reform. We're going to work with the White House to deliver.\"",
      "House Republican leadership points out the legislation has exceeded its targets for spending cuts -- goals these hard-liners voted for just over a month ago in the budget blueprint -- slashing over $1.5 trillion from the federal budget.",
      "Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris said there is \"no way\" the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" passes in the House Wednesday -- despite Johnson's goal of putting the bill on the floor as early as Wednesday after it clears the House Rules Committee. Johnson is still working to secure the votes of the more than a dozen Republicans who are seeking additional changes to the legislation. Without changes, there is enough opposition to defeat it as Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes.",
      "\"We're further away from a deal,\" Harris said on Newsmax Wednesday morning. \"This bill actually got worse overnight. There is no way it passes today.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a House Rules Committee hearing on the GOP bill is still going strong after it started at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday with committee chairs and ranking members debating the details of the more than 1,000 page \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\"",
      "GOP leaders have still not released expected changes -- negotiated by hard-liners and moderates -- to the tax and budget bill. Rules Committee Chair Rep. Virginia Foxx said Republican changes to the package will be unveiled at some point during the hearing.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, lambasted Republicans' reconciliation bill.",
      "\"I've got a simple question. What the hell are Republicans so afraid of? What the hell are you so scared of that you guys are holding this hearing at 1 o'clock in the morning. It's a simple question that speaks to the heart of what's going on here, and one that I'm going to keep on asking, if Republicans are so proud of what is in this bill, then why are you trying to ram it through in the dead of night?\" McGovern said.",

    "summary": "If this past weekend in European politics is an indicator of anything, it's that the \"Trump effect\" is real, and its reverberations are unpredictable.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say Trump's influence abroad is \"stronger\" than it was two years ago.",
      "If this past weekend in European politics is an indicator of anything, it's that the \"Trump effect\" is real, and its reverberations are unpredictable.",
      "Three European Union countries held elections on Sunday -- Romania, Poland and Portugal -- with the results failing to show any clear trend for the future of European politics. The elections did, however, indicate the American president's growing influence on the continent.",
      "The disparate responses from voters in all three countries -- and the lack of any decisive victory for any one party or candidate in Portugal or Poland -- hint that the political polarization that has roiled the U.S. over the past decade is a global trend, not merely an American one.",
      "As to whether President Donald Trump and the \"Make America Great Again\" movement swirling around him can establish European avatars, the question remains an open one.",
      "\"I don't know if I have a firm answer,\" Celia Belin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and head of its Paris office, told ABC News. \"At the moment, we are all monitoring what is happening and how this influence can establish itself.\"",
      "\"It's very early,\" Belin added. \"This is an ongoing phenomenon.\"",
      "While it's unclear what the extent of Trump's impact on European politics will ultimately be, Belin said the impact is \"stronger\" than it was two years ago.",
      "Trump's influence -- indirect and direct -- has given populist movements like Germany's Alternative for Germany party, Poland's nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party and Portugal's far-right Chega party a clear boost, evident in recent elections in each country.",
      "\"If I am to compare with two years ago, for example, it is stronger, it is more united, it gives inspiration to a ton of populist nationalist leaders in Europe,\" Belin said. \"It's getting stronger. That's the direction it's going in right now.\"",
      "The groundswell of grievances that carried Trump to the Oval Office twice is not merely an American phenomenon and manifests differently in individual nations. Concerns over globalization, immigration, inequality, the cost of living, low rates of economic growth, progressivism and national identity are near-universal in the Western democratic world.",
      "Trump seized upon those conditions in the U.S. and right-wing leaders in Europe are seeking to do the same.",
      "This week's election results in Romania, Poland and Portugal, however, suggest the translation of Trumpism into European political languages remains incomplete.",
      "In Romania, voters opted for Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan's pro-Europe, pro-NATO, pro-Ukraine platform. Dan won with around 54% of the vote.",
      "Dan's opponent -- Trump supporter George Simion, who courted the MAGA movement and even visited the U.S. during his campaign -- came up short, though he vowed to continue \"our fight for freedom and our great values along with other patriots, sovereignists and conservatives all over the world.\"",
      "In Poland, the presidential election saw liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski secure an unexpectedly tight victory in the first round of voting with around 31% of the vote, beating out right-wing rival Karol Nawrocki -- who was personally endorsed by Trump -- who had 29.5% of the vote.",
      "The two men will go into the second round of voting on June 1, hoping to draw voters from other minor candidates, among them a significant bloc which voted for far-right firebrand Slawomir Mentzen, who came third with 14.8%.",
      "Piotr Buras, a senior policy fellow at ECFR at the head of its Warsaw office, told ABC News that Trump has loomed large over the election.",
      "Nawrocki framed himself as the Trump-friendly candidate, along with his backers in the Law and Justice party, criticizing Trzaskowski's Civic Platform party and Prime Minister Donald Tusk for allegedly undermining Polish-American relations.",

      "\"We used to have a nationwide consensus on America,\" Buras said, with voters generally warm to the idea of close ties with Washington, D.C. \"Now, because of this ideological divide in Poland, because of the U.S. and because of Trump's approach to Europe, Poland is suddenly divided on how to go about America,\" he added.",
      "In Portugal, meanwhile, the far-right Chega party gained a record 22.6% share of the vote, blowing open the long-standing two-party domination of the country's political scene even though it was unable to overhaul the ruling center-right Democratic Alliance.",
      "\"I am not going to stop until I become the prime minister of Portugal,\" Chega leader Andre Ventura -- who was among the foreign politicians invited to Trump's second inauguration -- said.",
      "Such confidence in defeat may be buoyed by the strong foundations populist parties and candidates are putting down in Europe. Across the continent, far-right groups are winning historically large chunks of the electorate and dominating political debates, even without securing the reins of power.",
      "In the U.K., the right-wing Reform party recorded a stunning performance in the May local elections, winning hundreds of council seats and leaving leader Nigel Farage -- well-known for his cozy relationship with Trump and the MAGA movement -- to declare an end to the traditional dominance of Britain's two major parties.",
      "In Germany's February parliamentary election, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party converted years of growing popularity to win around 21% of the vote and become the second-largest party in the Bundestag.",
      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance conducted his first foreign trip in his new position to Germany in February, shortly before the election, speaking at the Munich Security Conference on February 14.",
      "In his speech addressing the annual security conference, Vance criticized Europe for hindering free speech, suggesting the conference's decision to ban AfD members from attending was a form of censorship.",
      "\"In Britain, and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat,\" Vance said. \"I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns, or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections, or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy.\" Many political analysts considered Vance's remarks to be a tacit endorsement of AfD from the Trump administration.",
      "And in France, President Emmanuel Macron has thus far held off the persistent challenge for the presidency from far-right leader Marine Le Pen and the National Rally, but he was unable to stop the party from becoming the largest in the National Assembly in 2024. Only a shaky minority government has kept the party out of the prime minister's office.",
      "The insurgent parties are coordinating. Leaders have increasingly been drawn to American conservative events, such as the Conservative Political Action Conference -- the first-ever European installment of which was held in Budapest, Hungary, in 2022.",
      "And this year, right-wingers gathered for the Make Europe Great Again conference in Madrid in February, organized by Spain's far-right VOX party.",
      "Buras noted rumors that Vice President JD Vance may even attend a planned CPAC event in Poland in late May, in what could only be interpreted as a show of support for Nawrocki. The event raises the prospect of American \"interference almost, or at least influence, from the U.S.,\" Buras said.",
      "Trump is just as divisive abroad as he is at home. Indeed, polls consistently indicate that many European voters are skeptical of, unsettled by or outright hostile to the American president.",
      "There is, then, no guarantee that a MAGA association will put foreign populists in power. Recent elections in Canada and Australia, for example, saw center-left establishment parties secure victory against conservative opponents they sought to smear as Trumpian.",
      "Trump's return to the White House \"has woken up the anti-populist or anti-nationalist movements,\" Belin said. \"It gives them a foil. \u2026 You want to mobilize your electorate and use the U.S. of Donald Trump as a sort of scarecrow -- the mobilization effect goes in two directions.\"",
      "\"It fuels the extremist base and so it excites a lot of people, but it also fuels the other side and it also frightens the middle,\" Belin said.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers rushed to prevent deportations to Libya earlier this month.",
      "A federal judge is probing whether the Trump administration deported migrants to South Sudan on Tuesday in violation of an earlier order barring deportations of migrants to countries other than their own without giving them sufficient chance to contest their removal.",
      "An order from U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy late Tuesday directs the government to \"maintain custody and control\" of anyone deported to South Sudan covered under a lawsuit challenging the administration's practice of deporting migrants to third countries \u201cto ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful.\u201d",
      "The judge's order comes after attorneys with the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and other groups filed an emergency motion to bar the government from deporting migrants to South Sudan, saying they had indications at least 12 migrants had been sent to the East African country.",
      "Lawyers said they believed one of the men, a native of Myanmar identified in court filings as \"N.M.,\" was removed from the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. The attorneys also allege a Vietnamese migrant referred to as T.T.P. \"appears to have suffered the same fate.\"",
      "Both men named in the filing have orders of removal to their home countries, the attorneys said.",
      "During a hastily arranged virtual hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston, a Justice Department lawyer told the judge that N.M. had been deported to Myanmar, not South Sudan. But the lawyer declined to say where T.T.P had been sent, saying the information was classified, according to an account of the hearing in The New York Times.",
      "The lawyer also said the current location of the plane carrying the migrants to be removed as well as its final destination were classified, according to the Times.",
      "Murphy, a Biden appointee, told the DOJ lawyer that officials who carried out deportations in violation of his earlier order could face criminal contempt proceedings, according to the Times.

      "ABC News has reached out to DHS for comment about the alleged removals to South Sudan.",

      "The U.S. State Department currently advises American travelers not to visit South Sudan due to the threat of crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Another hearing in the case is set for Wednesday at 11 a.m.",
      "Last month, Murphy issued an order requiring the Trump administration to provide individuals with written notice before they're removed to a third country and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise concerns about their safety. The preliminary injunction also prohibits the government from removing a migrant to a third country without screening for possible risks to their safety in that country and a 15-day window to contest the government's determination based on that screening.",
      "In a declaration, one of the attorneys for N.M. said he was also one of the men whom the Trump administration attempted to deport to Libya earlier this month setting off a legal scramble to block it. In that instance, the judge said removing the men to Libya without due process would \"clearly violate\" his order.",

      "Wisconsin could go down as billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s last big spend on a political campaign",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin could go down as billionaire Elon Musk's last big spend on a political campaign.",
      "And it was a flop.",
      "Musk, the richest person in the world, said Tuesday that he would be spending less on political campaigns. The announcement came as Musk is stepping back from his role in the Trump administration, saying he will spend more time focused on his businesses, and just seven weeks after the candidate he backed in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race lost by 10 percentage points.",
      "Democrats in the swing state said Musk's comments show that a party-led effort in this spring\u2019s election, dubbed \u201c People vs. Musk, \u201d succeeded in making Musk and his money \u201ctoxic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people have won,\u201d said Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler. \u201cThe biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.\"",
      "Brandon Scholz, a retired longtime Republican strategist in the state, said that at least in Wisconsin, \u201cafter that court race he deserves to be labeled as toxic.\u201d",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Musk couldn\u2019t spend money on races in the state and nationally again, especially if the stakes are high and his money could make a difference, Scholz said.",
      "\u201cDoes he bring with him a lot of baggage? Possibly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cBut over time, maybe not as much.\"",
      "Musk's spending in this year's Wisconsin Supreme Court race helped make it the most expensive court race in U.S. history. And it came just five months after Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Donald Trump win, reversing losses in Wisconsin and other battleground states four years earlier.",
      "Musk was all-in on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, even making a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat \u2014 popular with fans of the NFL's Green Bay Packers \u2014 and personally handing out checks for $1 million to supporters. It was an extension of Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the presidential race, where he campaigned alongside Trump and headlined some of his own rallies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a super big deal,\u201d he told the roughly 2,000-person crowd in the event center, where hundreds of protesters were rallying against his appearance outside. \u201cI\u2019m not phoning it in. I\u2019m here in person.\u201d",
      "But his appearance \u2014 and money \u2014 didn\u2019t work.",
      "The candidate Musk backed lost Brown County, the home of Green Bay, by 3 percentage points, going on to lose statewide by more than three times that margin.",
      "After the defeat, Musk has said little publicly about the race and his involvement in it. His popularity has also plummeted.",
      "An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll taken two weeks after the Wisconsin court election found that just 33% of adults had a favorable view of the Tesla CEO, down from 41% in December.",
      "Musk's involvement in the race came at the same time he was the chain-saw-wielding face of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government.",
      "His Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, has enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies, but it has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, is one of the most liberal members of Congress and a loud critic of both Trump and Musk.",
      "Pocan is skeptical that Musk truly will back away.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of it, first of all,\u201d Pocan said. \u201cThis just means they realize how toxic Elon Musk is and the work he did through DOGE.\u201d",
      "Kelda Roys, a Democratic state senator, was also tempered in her excitement over Musk saying he plans to do a \u201clot less\u201d political spending in the future.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of other billionaire bros, I\u2019m sure, willing and happy to step up in his place,\u201d Roys said.",
      "Musk could also get involved with future races, but in a much more low-profile way, said Scholz, the Republican.",
      "\u201cIn Wisconsin, he had such a huge, huge, huge profile,\u201d Scholz said. \"He became the campaign. He became the story.\u201d",
      "Musk spent at least $3 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race himself. Musk-backed groups America PAC and a Rebuilding America\u2019s Future spent another $19 million in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel. That was part of more than $100 million spent on both sides.",
      "America PAC spent at least $6 million on vendors who sent door-to-door canvassers across the state, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It was a reprise of what the group did last fall across the seven most competitive presidential battleground states, including Wisconsin, which were carried by Trump.",
      "In addition to his political contributions, Musk paid three individual voters $1 million each for signing a petition in an effort to goose turnout. Musk also offered to pay $20 to anyone who signed up on his group\u2019s site to knock on doors for Schimel and posted a photo of themselves as proof. His organization promised $100 to every voter who signed the petition against \u201cactivist judges\u201d and another $100 for every signer they referred.",
      "Musk himself hosted Schimel on his podcast and cast what was at stake in stark terms.",
      "\u201cA seemingly small election could determine the fate of Western civilization,\u201d Musk said in a social media post on the April 1 election day. \u201cI think it matters for the future of the world.\u201d",
      "Democrats made the race a referendum on both Musk and Trump's agenda, successfully electing a judge whose victory ensures the Wisconsin Supreme Court will remain under liberal control until at least 2028.",
      "Coincidentally, Musk's announcement about spending less on political races came just hours after a liberal judge announced her candidacy for the 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor is challenging a conservative incumbent justice who sided with Trump in his unsuccessful lawsuit that attempted to overturn his 2020 loss in Wisconsin. The race will be decided in April, months before the midterms in which Democrats hope unease with Trump and Musk will help the party make gains.",
      "Taylor appeared to be taking a similar approach to her campaign that the winning Democratic-backed candidate did this year.",
      "\u201cMy campaign is going to be a campaign about the people of this state,\" she told The Associated Press, \u201cnot about billionaires, not about the most powerful.\u201d",

      "Current screening recommendations suggest men age 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of a PSA test with their doctor and make an individual decision when or if they need it.

      "The last elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo have been quietly moved to a zoo in Oklahoma despite a lawsuit seeking to have them transferred to a sanctuary where they could live out their days with more room to roam",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Billy and Tina, the last remaining elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo, were quietly moved this week to a zoo in Oklahoma despite a pending lawsuit seeking to have them transferred instead to an animal sanctuary where they could live out their days with more room to roam.",
      "The announcement last month that Billy, 40, and Tina, 59, would be sent to the Tulsa Zoo angered animal advocates who argue that they would be subjected again to an enclosure that's too small for aging elephants.",
      "The move came \u201cunder cover of darkness,\u201d said Jake Davis, an attorney for the Nonhuman Rights Project, which is suing the LA Zoo. Davis said he received reports that the Asian elephants were transferred out about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to elude protesters who've been staking out the zoo.",
      "The nonprofit's lawsuit asked a judge to release Billy and Tina from the LA Zoo and send them to one of two accredited sanctuaries appropriate for elephants where they would have full-time care and ample space.",
      "\u201cAt a sanctuary, they could live as nature intended,\u201d Davis said Wednesday. \u201cThey need massive swaths of land; they need varied terrain.\u201d",
      "The LA Zoo said in a statement Wednesday that the elephants \u201chave arrived safely at the Tulsa Zoo,\u201d but didn't say when the transfer occurred.",
      "The move was necessary because the Tulsa Zoo has other Asian elephants who will provide important socialization for Billy and Tina because \u201ckeeping them in larger groups is crucial for their well-being,\u201d especially at their advanced age, the LA Zoo statement said. Asian elephants typically live around 60 years.",
      "A move to a sanctuary was considered, but the Tulsa Zoo was the top recommendation based on the standards of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Elephant Species Survival Plan, which considers \u201cspace, herd dynamics, and expertise of the staff,\u201d the LA Zoo said.",
      "\u201cThis option also ensured that Billy and Tina would be able to remain together,\" the statement said.",
      "Davis said he expects the Los Angeles lawsuit will be dismissed but his group will not give up the fight to get Billy and Tina a sanctuary retirement home. He said his team is exploring legal options in Oklahoma. The Tulsa Zoo didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "A separate lawsuit filed this month by an LA resident sought to halt the elephants\u2019 transfer, but a judge denied an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. That lawsuit includes a declaration by the singer Cher, who has advocated for the elephants for years, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "\u201cBilly and Tina have served their time in confinement,\u201d Cher said in the declaration. \u201cThey deserve the chance to live out their lives in peace and dignity.\u201d",
      "Zoos across the country have been targeted in recent years by animal activists who criticize living conditions for elephants. Broadly, some elephant experts say urban zoos simply don\u2019t have the space that elephants, who roam extensive distances in the wild, need for a normal life.",
      "Some larger zoos such as the Toronto Zoo and San Francisco Zoo have phased out their elephant programs, sending their aging animals to sanctuaries that have far more space.",
      "But other zoos say they are committed to keeping elephants and are turning to breeding, arguing that a sustainable population of zoo elephants will help spur a commitment to wildlife conservation among future generations of visitors.",
      "In New York, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed legal papers to try to free the Asian elephant Happy from the Bronx Zoo but lost in court in 2022. The group then filed similar papers in California to try to free the Fresno Chaffee Zoo 's three African elephants but a judge ruled against the group.",

      "Noem, the keynote speaker at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy's commencement, outlined the Trump administration's plans to increase the service's military workforce by at least 15,000 by the end of fiscal year 2028. The plan also calls for reducing the number of admirals by 25%, boosting recruiting efforts and increasing the fleet, including icebreakers that are used in the Arctic.",
      "\u201cA new chapter for America\u2019s Coast Guard, one like we have never seen before, starts right now,\u201d she told the 256 cadets, who became newly minted officers from the prestigious service academy in New London, Connecticut.",
      "Noem spoke of the Coast Guard being 10% short of its enlisted workforce goals and relying on outdated aircraft and ships, some sailing with 75% of the needed crew members. She recalled a meeting with President Donald Trump, who she said asked what the Coast Guard needed.",
      "\u201cI said sir, they need everything,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThey've been neglected for too long.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are on the edge of transformational change,\u201d said Adm. Kevin E. Lunday, who Noem announced Wednesday will become the service\u2019s new commandant. Lunday has been the service\u2019s acting commandant since Jan. 21, after Trump fired former Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, the first female leader of the Coast Guard.",
      "The administration\u2019s modernization plan, called Force Design 2028, officially takes effect on Wednesday, Noem said. Besides increasing the workforce, it calls for the appointment of a dedicated civilian leader to oversee the 234-year-old maritime service, essentially mirroring how the other branches of the U.S. military are led at the Pentagon.",
      "Nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the proposed Coast Guard Service Secretary within the Homeland Security Department would advocate for a service \u201cweakened by decades of underinvestment, neglect and strategic drift,\u201d and create a new level of accountability, according to the plan released Wednesday.",
      "Such a change would require congressional approval. Currently, there is at least one bill before Congress that would create such a position.",
      "\u201cCreating a Secretary of the Coast Guard ensures they have the leadership, resources, and support they need to continue their vital missions,\u201d said the bill\u2019s author, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell of Mississippi, chair of the House Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, in a recent written statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time we give the Coast Guard the same level of recognition and advocacy that other military branches receive.\u201d",
      "Control of the Coast Guard was officially transferred from the U.S. Department of Transportation to DHS in 2003. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, a four-star admiral and the highest ranking Coast Guard officer, is now tasked with leading the service.",

      "Under the Trump administration\u2019s plan, the appointment of a secretary, accountable to the president and the DHS secretary and subject to congressional oversight, presents an opportunity to reform the service\u2019s organizational structure.",
      "\u201cThe Coast Guard must be able to conduct its missions and deliver results without being mired in wasteful bureaucracy,\u201d the report reads.",
      "Many of the service academy graduates cheered the promised reforms during Wednesday's commencement.

      "\u201cBut I'm not worried because I know exactly who is stepping up to that challenge. Our class,\u201d she said.",

      "Barletta oversaw a $247 million project, that started in 2018, to rebuild the Route 6/10 interchange. The charges involved construction-fill disposal that took place in 2020, where investigators say the company transported backfill from other projects to the Route 6/10 site. The project has since been completed.",

      "When the state criminal charges were filed, the company said the soil was \u201curban fill \" \u2014 commonly found in city settings throughout the U.S. The attorney general's office maintained that the fill contained hazardous materials and the company disposed more than 4,500 tons in Rhode Island.",
      "\"Whether Barletta learns from this experience remains to be seen. But they have paid a heavy price for their unlawful, irresponsible, and deceptive behavior, and deservedly so,\u201d Neronha said.",

      "His concerns were well-founded, said Ben Railton, a professor of English and American studies at Fitchburg State University in Massachusetts. Although roughly 180,000 Black men served in the Union Army, the holiday in many communities would essentially become \u201cwhite Memorial Day,\u201d especially after the rise of the Jim Crow South, Railton told the AP in 2023.",
      "In the 1880s, then-President Grover Cleveland was said to have spent the holiday going fishing \u2014 and \u201cpeople were appalled,\u201d Matthew Dennis, an emeritus history professor at the University of Oregon, previously told the AP.",
      "But when the Indianapolis 500 held its inaugural race on May 30, 1911, a report from the AP made no mention of the holiday \u2014 or any controversy.",
      "Dennis said Memorial Day\u2019s potency diminished somewhat with the addition of Armistice Day, which marked World War I\u2019s end on Nov. 11, 1918. Armistice Day became a national holiday by 1938 and was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.",
      "In 1971, Congress changed Memorial Day from every May 30 to the last Monday in May. Dennis said the creation of the three-day weekend recognized that Memorial Day had long been transformed into a more generic remembrance of the dead, as well as a day of leisure.",
      "Just a year later, Time Magazine wrote that the holiday had become \u201ca three-day nationwide hootenanny that seems to have lost much of its original purpose.\u201d",
      "Even in the 19th century, grave ceremonies were followed by leisure activities such as picnicking and foot races, Dennis said.",
      "The holiday also evolved alongside baseball and the automobile, the five-day work week and summer vacation, according to the 2002 book \u201cA History of Memorial Day: Unity, Discord and the Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d",
      "In the mid-20th century, a small number of businesses began to open defiantly on the holiday.",
      "Once the holiday moved to Monday, \u201cthe traditional barriers against doing business began to crumble,\u201d authors Richard Harmond and Thomas Curran wrote.",
      "These days, Memorial Day sales and traveling are deeply woven into the nation\u2019s muscle memory.",

      "South African officials have strongly pushed back against Trump's accusation and Ramaphosa sought the meeting to set the record straight and salvage his country\u2019s relationship with the United States.

      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is considering approval of a black bear hunt for December and into the future, which could eventually allow the use of up to six dogs to corner the bears and use of bowhunting",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Ten years ago, Florida held a black bear hunt that resulted in more than 300 animals killed in just two days before it was halted early. It was controversial from the start and hasn\u2019t happened since \u2014 until possibly later this year amid strong opposition once again.",
      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission met Wednesday in Ocala to consider a bear hunt for December and annually into the future, possibly allowing the use of up to six dogs to corner the bears. Methods could include bowhunting, similar to rules for hunting deer, and bear hunting in baited areas.",
      "The commission staff says the goal is to \u201cbegin managing population growth\u201d for bears, which number about 4,000 in Florida. \u201cManaging population growth is important to balance species numbers with suitable habitat and maintain a healthy population,\u201d the staff report says.",
      "Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods, whose fast-growing county hosted the meeting, said his office has received 107 calls about bear encounters with humans over the past nine months \u2014 likely only a fraction of actual encounters because many rural residents don't report them. Woods said he supports the hunt.",
      "\u201cIt needs to be regulated and it should be regulated. I think we keep not only our citizens safe but the state of Florida\u2019s citizens safe,\" Woods told the commission.",
      "Several hunters and representatives of outdoors groups urged the commission to approve the hunt, noting Florida is one of only six states with significant black bear populations that does not allow it.",
      "\u201cBear is a game species. It\u2019s time for us to have some level of bear hunt,\" said Travis Thompson, executive director at the All Florida conservation organization.",
      "Hunt opponents contend there isn\u2019t enough scientific evidence to justify killing bears and that the most reasonable approach is to convince people in Florida\u2019s ever-sprawling developments to secure garbage and take other non-lethal steps to limit human-bear conflicts.",
      "\u201cI implore you to not allow the slaughter of these majestic animals we have in Florida,\u201d said Leslie Carlile, an opponent whose family goes back several generations in Florida. \u201cTrophy hunting is pure evil in my opinion.\u201d",
      "The FWC has received more than 13,000 online comments about the proposal, about three-quarters of them opposed. At Wednesday's meeting, 170 people signed up to speak on both sides of the issue.",
      "Hunt opponent Janet Osborne told the commission it would \u201ctake a step backward\u201d by approving the bear proposal.",
      "\u201cThe problem is the overpopulation of people,\u201d she said.",
      "A final decision on whether to hold the bear hunt is expected in August.",
      "Among other things, supporters of the hunt point to a black bear's extremely rare, fatal attack earlier this month on 89-year-old Robert Markel and his dog in a rural part of Collier County, in southwest Florida. Bears are also frequently seen in neighborhoods that stretch into their habitat, one even wandering onto Disney World's Magic Kingdom in 2023.",
      "In the 2015 hunt, hunting permits were for anyone who could pay for them, leading to a chaotic event that was shut down days early. The 300-plus bears killed then included at least 38 females with cubs, meaning the little bears probably died too.",
      "This time, the plan is to have a random, limited drawing of permits with a limit of 187. Hunters could kill only one bear each and only in certain parts of Florida where the bear population is large enough. There would be no killing of cubs and none of females with cubs, according to the FWC staff.",
      "A permit would cost $100 for a Florida resident and $300 for a nonresident.",
      "For 2025, the plan is to hold the hunt from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28. In the future, the FWC foresees a bear hunt between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, subject to more studies about the effect of hunting and the population of the animals.",
      "Private landowners with 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) or more could hold what the FWC calls a \u201cbear harvest program\u201d on their property under the proposal. Bears could be hunted at bait feeding stations on private property.",

      "The Trump administration says it will consider selling leases to extract minerals from the seabed off the South Pacific island of American Samoa",
      "The Trump administration said Wednesday that it will consider selling leases to extract minerals from the seabed off the South Pacific island of American Samoa, a potential first step in a wider industry push to allow deep-sea mining that environmentalists oppose because they say it could irreparably harm marine ecosystems.",
      "The Department of Interior said it is responding to an April request from California-based company Impossible Metals for a commercial auction. The company wants to mine the ocean floor for deposits of nickel, cobalt and other critical minerals.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed an executive order directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to fast-track permits for companies to mine the ocean floor in U.S. and international waters. The move comes amid the Trump administration's trade war with China, which controls many critical minerals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese used in high-tech manufacturing, including for military uses.",
      "\u201cCritical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation\u2019s resilience and safeguarding our national interests,\u201d Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release. He said the upcoming evaluation could be a prelude to future mining in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.",
      "Environmentalists worry that allowing more ocean mining could harm fisheries and even affect oceans\u2019 ability to absorb and store carbon dioxide, the main driver of global warming. More than 30 countries, as well as fisheries trade groups, environmentalists and some auto and tech companies, have called for a moratorium on seabed mining.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready for a fight as Trump\u2019s dangerous deep-sea mining obsession worsens,\u201d said Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cMining the ocean floor will damage fragile habitat and unique critters we haven\u2019t even discovered yet. Island communities depend on healthy oceans and declaring open season on mineral prospecting puts people and wildlife at risk.\u201d",
      "Impossible Metals did not immediately respond to a voicemail and email seeking comment. It says on its website that it has developed an autonomous underwater robot that uses artificial intelligence to minimize harm to marine life and habitat.",
      "Burgum said the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will undertake a multistep evaluation, starting by asking for public input.",
      "Opponents say any U.S. approval of deep-sea mining would ignore an ongoing process to adopt international rules for the practice. Most countries in the 1990s joined a United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority to govern seabed mining in international waters. But the U.S. never signed on to the effort, which hasn't yet adopted rules.",
      "Countries can approve mining in their own territorial waters, so Impossible Metals wouldn\u2019t need permission from the authority. Canada-based The Metals Company has said it plans to apply for permits this year through a U.S. subsidiary to mine in international waters.",

      "A former New York state trooper has pleaded guilty to charges that he shot himself then falsely claimed he was wounded by an unknown gunman on a Long Island highway",
      "MINEOLA, N.Y. -- A former New York state trooper pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges that he shot himself then falsely claimed he was wounded by an unknown gunman on a Long Island highway, prompting a regionwide search.",
      "Thomas Mascia agreed to serve six months in jail, followed by five months of probation and continued mental health treatment as he formally changed his not guilty plea during a court appearance in Nassau County court in Mineola.",
      "He also agreed, as part of his plea deal, to pay $289,000 in restitution for the overtime costs for officers during the three-day search for a nonexistent suspect. Mascia will be sentenced Aug. 20.",
      "The West Hempstead resident had been charged with official misconduct, tampering with evidence and falsifying documents. He became a trooper in 2019 and resigned after being suspended without pay while state police launched a criminal investigation into the shooting.",
      "Mascia\u2019s parents, Dorothy and Thomas, were also expected to plead guilty Wednesday to firearms charges.",
      "Mascia claimed he was shot in the leg on Oct. 30 by a driver parked on the shoulder of the Southern State Parkway, about a mile from his home.",
      "The shooting prompted a massive search as the trooper said the suspect, who he claimed was a \u201cdark-skinned\u201d man, fled in a car bearing temporary New Jersey plates heading toward New York City.",
      "Instead, prosecutors say, Mascia shot himself in a local park, stashed the gun, drove to the highway and called for backup. They say the ruse was an apparent bid to gain attention and sympathy.",
      "Jeffrey Lichtman, Mascia's lawyer, didn't immediately comment. He previously said the former trooper, who resigned in January after his arrest, has been suffering from \u201cuntreated mental health issues\u201d for years.",
      "Mascia had appeared in court earlier this month to change his plea, but the judge at the time halted the proceedings after the former trooper said he did not feel well mentally and was receiving treatment.",

      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block court orders requiring Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to turn over documents about its operations to a government watchdog group",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to block court orders requiring Elon Musk \u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to turn over documents about its operations to a government watchdog group.",
      "The Justice Department's latest emergency appeal to the high court concerns whether DOGE, which has been central to President Donald Trump's push to remake the government, is a federal agency that is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The administration argues DOGE is merely a presidential advisory body that is exempt from requests for documents under FOIA.",
      "The administration wants the justices to freeze orders that would force DOGE to turn over documents to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and have acting DOGE administrator Amy Gleason answer questions under oath within the next three weeks. CREW sued in February, claiming that DOGE \u201cwields shockingly broad power\u201d with no transparency about its actions.",
      "In March, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE's role is likely more than just advisory, noting its claims in helping to shutter USAID and cut billions of dollars in government contracts. \u201cCanceling any government contract would seem to require substantial authority \u2014 and canceling them on this scale certainly does,\u201d Cooper wrote. DOGE \u201clikely has at least some independent authority to identify and terminate federal employees, federal programs, and federal contracts.\u201d",
      "A panel of the federal appeals court in Washington initially put Cooper's order on hold, but a different panel later reinstated the order. Cooper has since set deadlines for the administration to comply by June 13.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the justices to act quickly, calling Cooper's orders \u201cextraordinarily overbroad and intrusive.\u201d",
      "The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals has taken to the Supreme Court after lower courts have blocked parts of Trump's agenda.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are getting closer to passing President Donald Trump's tax breaks, spending cuts and beefed-up border security as Speaker Mike Johnson attempts to pass the package over unified Democratic opposition by Memorial Day.",
      "House committees have labored for months on the legislation, which exceeds 1,000 pages and is titled the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d a nod to Trump himself.",
      "GOP divisions have narrowed but continue as fiscal conservatives worry the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to curb Medicaid spending, while Republicans from competitive swing districts have expressed concerns about the prospect of their constituents losing access to health coverage and food assistance for constituents.",
      "Democrats say they will fight what House party leader Hakeem Jeffries calls \u201cthis extreme and toxic bill.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in and out of the legislative package so far:",
      "Republicans look to make permanent the individual income and estate tax cuts passed in Trump\u2019s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.",
      "To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden's presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.",
      "The bill includes a temporary boost in the standard deduction \u2014 a $1,000 increase for individuals, bringing it to $16,000 for individual filers, and a $2,000 boost for joint filers, bringing it to $32,000. The deduction reduces the amount of income that is actually subject to income tax.",
      "There is also a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 for 2025 through 2028. It then returns to $2,000 and will increase to account for inflation.",
      "The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million and is adjusted for inflation going forward.",
      "Several of the provisions Trump promised in the campaign would be temporary, lasting roughly through his term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That's also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Among the various business tax provisions, small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, will be able to subtract 23% of their qualified business income from their taxes. The deduction has been 20%",
      "Businesses will temporarily be allowed to fully expense domestic research and development costs in the year they occur and the cost of machinery, equipment and other qualifying assets. This encourages businesses to invest in ways that enhances their productivity.",
      "House Republicans would reduce spending on food aid, what is known as the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, by about $267 billion over 10 years.",
      "States would shoulder 5% of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75% of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.",
      "Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.",
      "Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.",
      "At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.",
      "A focal point of the package is nearly $700 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program, according to CBO.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirement would not kick in until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump leaves office. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.",
      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by at least 7.6 million from the Medicaid changes, and possibly more with other changes to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.",
      "Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.",
      "The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.",
      "The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.",
      "Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.",
      "\u201cMAGA\u201d is shorthand for Trump's signature line, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But in this case, it means \u201cMoney Accounts for Growth and Advancement.\u201d",
      "For parents or guardians who open new \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.",
      "Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50% of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.",
      "The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.",
      "There's $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There's also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.",
      "Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.",
      "There's also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.",
      "It would provide $25 billion for Trump's \u201cGolden Dome for America,\u201d a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation's ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.",
      "It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.",
      "A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.",
      "The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a \u201crepayment assistance\u201d plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.",
      "Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.",
      "There would be a tax increase, up to 21%, on some university endowments.",
      "To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.",
      "Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden\u2019s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.",
      "In a last-minute add, Republicans also included a provision authorizing sales of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah, prompting outrage from Democrats and environmentalists.",

      "The Northeast Cartel is a remnant of the Zetas. Zetas were comprised of former Mexican military officers and began as an armed militaristic wing of the Gulf Cartel that eventually split and became its own trafficking organization.",
      "The Northeast cartel has retained a relatively small portion of what the Zetas once ruled. Its base is Nuevo Laredo, the busiest commercial port on the U.S.-Mexico border.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Justice Department moved Wednesday to cancel settlements with Minneapolis and Louisville that called for an overhaul of their police departments following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor that became the catalyst for nationwide racial injustice protests in the summer of 2020.",
      "The Trump administration also announced it was retracting the findings of Justice Department investigations into six other police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations. The moves represent a dramatic about-face for a department that under President Joe Biden had aggressively pushed for federal oversight of police forces it accused of widespread abuses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our view at the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division under the Trump administration that federal micromanagement of local police should be a rare exception, and not the norm,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the division, told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe specifics of policing policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level where there\u2019s local accountability and local control over funding and policy issues,\u201d Dhillon said.",
      "Following a scathing report by the Justice Department in 2023, Minneapolis in January approved a consent decree with the federal government in the final days of the Biden administration to overhaul its training and use-of-force policies under court supervision.",
      "The agreement required approval from a federal court in Minnesota. But the Trump administration was granted a delay soon after taking office while it considered its options, and on Wednesday told the court it does not intend to proceed. It planned to file a similar motion in federal court in Kentucky.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- After his best friend and four other of his fellow death row inmates have been put to death in less than a year, a South Carolina inmate wants to become his own attorney which would likely mean his own execution in weeks or months.",
      "A federal judge has ordered a 45-day delay in James Robertson's request to have a different lawyer talk to him and make sure he really wants to fire his own attorneys and deal with the likely lethal consequences of his decision.",
      "Robertson, 51, has been on death row since 1999 after killing both his parents in their Rock Hill home. He beat his father with the claw end of a hammer and a baseball bat and stabbed his mother. He tried to make it look like a robbery in hopes he would get his part of their $2.2 million estate, prosecutors said.",
      "Robertson has fired his lawyers before. Not long after he arrived on death row he wanted to drop his appeals after a card playing buddy never appealed his death sentence for setting a van on fire with his daughter inside outside his ex-wife's house.",
      "A one-page letter from Robinson landed in a federal judge's mailbox on April 7, four days before South Carolina executed its fifth inmate in seven months. It said Robertson and his lawyer had a difference of opinion.",
      "Since \u201cno ethical attorney will withdraw an appeal that will result in their client's execution,\u201d Robertson said he was ready to represent himself.",
      "Robertson's attorney Emily Paavola responded in court documents that Robertson wasn't taking medication for depression, suffered from chronic back pain and a skin condition that made him more depressed and was distressed over those five executions that dropped the close-knit death row population from 30 to 25.",
      "Included was Robertson's best friend on death row, Marion Bowman Jr., killed by lethal injection on Jan. 31, Paavola said.",
      "Paavloa asked the judge to hold off on Robertson's request for four months so he could have a full psychiatric evaluation to decide if he is mentally competent. Prosecutors suggested the judge could talk to Robertson on her own and decide if was able to act as his own lawyer.",
      "Judge Mary Gordon Baker decided to have a different lawyer talk to Robertson, making sure he understands the implications and consequences of his decision and report back by early July.",
      "Back in the early 2000s, Robertson also sought to drop all his appeals. He told a judge at the time he thought he got the better end of the deal with a death sentence instead of life in prison without parole and he had been let down by every lawyer he had encountered since his arrest.",
      "A judge asked Robertson at a 2002 hearing about his friend Michael Passaro's decision to volunteer for the death chamber.",
      "\u201cIt hasn't changed my view. What it did was it made me understand \u2014 enhanced reality a bit \u2014 to see my best friend go from one day playing cards with me to the next day not being here any more,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHe basically has taken a similar route that I'm choosing to take now and we spoke often about his decision.\u201d",
      "Volunteers, as they are called in death penalty circles, have been around since the death penalty was reinstated 50 years ago. About 10% of all U.S. executions are inmates who agree to die before finishing all their appeals, according to statistics from the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Research by the center and academics found that nearly all volunteers had mental illness that may have led them to decide they no longer wanted to live.",
      "The rate of volunteers has taken a steady decline along with the number of executions.",
      "From 2000 to 2009, 65 of the 590 U.S. executions involved an inmate who dropped appeals, including Timothy McVeigh for killing 148 people in the Oklahoma City bombing. From 2020 to now, just seven of the 111 people put to death have been considered volunteers by the center.",
      "The prosecutor who sent Robertson to death row said he can understand why inmates choose to stop fighting their sentences.",
      "\u201cIf you told me \u2014 be incarcerated on death row the rest of your life or just go ahead and go to the Lord, you know, I might choose the latter too,\u201d said Tommy Pope, now Speaker Pro Tem of the South Carolina House.",
      "But Pope said 26 years ago, he also observed a young man with above average intelligence who likes to work the system when he can and often thinks he is smarter than his attorneys.",
      "\u201cAs usual with Jimmy, it will remain to be seen how it plays out until the very end,\u201d Pope said.",

Murphy in Massachusetts ruled late Tuesday that the Trump administration must retain custody and control of those \u201ccurrently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return\u201d if he finds such removals were unlawful.

      "HONEOYE, N.Y. -- On a rainy March evening, John Bateman puts on his boots and a headlamp and heads to a wetland cut through by a busy road. As he walks, he scans the pavement for spring peepers, toads, salamanders and newts making their slow way as they migrate to new habitat each spring, and leans down occasionally to help guide one across.",
      "It's a small act that makes a big difference for these amphibians, who need different habitats for different stages of their life cycle \u2014 sometimes wetlands, sometimes drier uplands. Roads often separate these habitats, and migrating amphibians can get squished.",
      "They already face challenges from habitat lost to development. That's especially true for vernal pools, the small pools that show up each spring in forested ecosystems as snow melt and rainwater collect at low points on the ground. These pools hold water as late as July, and provide essential breeding habitat for amphibians like salamanders and frogs.",
      "Larger wetlands can enjoy federal protections, but not the vernal pools, which are too small and temporary.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, with urban sprawl and development, a lot of the forests are being cleared for new housing developments as people move out of the cities and into the suburbs,\" said Bateman, a professor of environmental conservation and horticulture at Finger Lakes Community College. \"When they clear these forest habitats, vernal pools are going to be buried and become new houses, condominiums, and neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey calls amphibian declines \u201ca global phenomenon\u201d and one that's been underway in the U.S. since at least the 1960s. The agency said populations are dropping almost 4% each year in the U.S.",
      "Development isn't the only threat. Amphibians are being affected by Earth's changing climate. The Appalachian region is particularly rich in salamander species, and with temperatures rising, their range is shifting northward, Bateman said.",
      "That concerns him.",
      "\u201cAt one point you hit the top and there is nowhere else to go,\" Bateman said.",
      "A warming climate also requires cold-blooded amphibians to spend more time hunting to get the food they need to maintain their metabolism, said Karen Lips, a University of Maryland biology professor whose research found salamanders becoming smaller as a result.",
      "Bateman isn't the only conservationist working to help amphibians.",
      "Margot Fass owns A Frog House, a center for frog advocacy in Pittsford, New York. In April, she raised money and worked with 70 volunteers to build three vernal pools as part of Save the Frogs Day. The pools should help amphibians, but will also be a source of water for birds and other wildlife.",
      "Fass grows animated as she talks about chemical-free gardens and their importance to amphibians: \u201cOne spray of pesticides can kill a frog within an hour. It\u2019s just horrible.\"",
      "Both she and Bateman are strong believers in educating their communities to help amphibians. They often give talks in schools, libraries and to various groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how few people really know that frogs are endangered or that a third of them have gone extinct,\" Fass said.",
      "The Genesee Land Trust, a not-for-profit conservation organization, is another active member in preserving and protecting land in the greater Rochester region. It owns Cornwall Preserve in Pultneyville, New York, on the edge of Lake Ontario. The trust bought the 77-acre property in 2016, becoming the first non-farmers to own the land in 200 years. They're preserving the historical farmland and in doing so have restored some wetlands and vernal pools.",
      "\u201cThe wetland immediately served a population of birds after we first started digging,\u201d said Elliotte Bowerman, the trust's director of communications.",
      "Catching amphibians may just be a nostalgic childhood memory for most, but for Bateman it never lost its magic. He believes preserving wetlands and vernal pools is critical not only for the amphibians and the environment, but for the next generation to experience the childlike wonder of discovering these hidden creatures.",
      "\u201cI think that the future generations are absolutely going to be at a loss to not have those experiences that I did as a child, to have that connection with nature,\" he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- United Way Worldwide and a group of foundations launched a new award Tuesday for \u201ccivic bravery,\u201d which includes grants of up to $50,000.",
      "The Courage Project, a partnership between United Way and funders like the Freedom Together Foundation, will grant $5 million in awards over at least a year to recognize nonprofits and individuals who stand up for their communities. The individual recipients won't receive a monetary award but can direct funds to a nonprofit of their choice.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t do it because they want recognition. They aren\u2019t elected officials. It\u2019s not something where they are required to do this work. They do it out of a love of humanity,\u201d said Angela Williams, president and CEO of United Way Worldwide, of the awardees.",
      "The first recipients include the United Way of South Sarasota County in Florida for providing legal services to older people and the working poor and Women of Welcome, a Colorado nonprofit that mobilizes evangelical women to advocate for asylum seekers and immigrants drawing on their faith.",
      "Bri Stensrud, the nonprofit's director, said it is a difficult time to raise money around immigration, especially for the long-term education and advocacy work her organization does. She received $25,000 as part of the award.",
      "\u201cI feel very honored to be recognized, to be known and to be invested in,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s another privilege to hold really humbly and I\u2019m super thankful for it.\u201d",
      "Educators from an upstate New York town were also recognized for their efforts to free three students and their mother who were arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t feel like we were exhibiting courage,\u201d said Jennifer Gaffney, the superintendent of Sackets Harbor Central School District. \u201cWe were just doing what we needed to do because it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "The school's principal, Jaime Cook, and other teachers sprung into action when they learned of their students' arrest and contacted government officials to advocate for their release. Community members organized a rally and their protest gained national attention.",
      "\u201cComing together as a community in the face of adversity, having hope and strength, I think that\u2019s an important message,\u201d said Jonna St. Croix, a teacher at the school and award recipient. \u201cI\u2019m a social studies teacher. Civic duty\u2019s important and I have to walk the walk.\u201d",
      "The three educators were given $50,000 to donate to a nonprofit of their choice and picked the Northern New York Community Foundation. They said they hope the funds will benefit students and young people in their area.",
      "Jana Gallus, a professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, who has studied awards, praised the decision to allow the individual recipients to decide where to give the grant funding. It creates a gift that keeps on giving with the recognition transferring from the awardee to the nonprofit, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople sometimes say recognition awards are this fluffy thing, they are soft. Recognition is not soft in that sense. It\u2019s actually very strategic,\u201d Gallus said. \u201cIt shapes who feels seen, who is seen, what actions then stand a chance of gaining traction.\u201d",
      "The Courage Project is accepting nominations from the public for future recipients, as well as from United Way. Gallus said asking for public nominations is another way the awards can help democratize who is celebrated as American heroes.",
      "The foundations will select the recipients from the nominees.",
      "Deepak Bhargava, president of the Freedom Together Foundation, said the group of funders were thinking ahead to the 250th anniversary of the United States ' independence and asked themselves what role they could play as philanthropic foundations. They decided to recognize the courage and civic action of people who don't normally get attention.",
      "\u201cMost awards are designed for people who are occupying positions of power or to some degree are already famous,\" he said. \u201cThese awards are designed to support people who do the invisible but essential work to make our communities healthy and to sustain our freedoms.\u201d",
      "The other funders of The Courage Project are CFLeads, The James Irvine Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Marguerite Casey Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, the Public Welfare Foundation, The Skillman Foundation and the Surdna Foundation.",
      "Separately, another nonprofit, The Heritage Foundation, which organized Project 2025 and focuses on building the conservative movement, will also award prizes to encourage the celebration of the country's independence.",
      "The foundation usually does not make grants but started to award Innovation Prizes in 2022 in part to put its endowment to work, said Bridgett Wagner, executive director of the Edwin J. Feulner Institute at the foundation.",
      "\u201cWe want to encourage with this. We want to spark innovation. We want people to do something that\u2019s different,\u201d she said of the prizes, which total around $1 million each year. She said the awards are more than grants because they communicate the foundation's support of the organization and raise their profile with other donors.",
      "The Heritage Foundation will announce the recipients of the America's 250th prizes in June.",

      "Wisconsin could go down as billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s last big spend on a political campaign",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin could go down as billionaire Elon Musk's last big spend on a political campaign.",
      "And it was a flop.",
      "Musk, the richest person in the world, said Tuesday that he would be spending less on political campaigns. The announcement came as Musk is stepping back from his role in the Trump administration, saying he will spend more time focused on his businesses, and just seven weeks after the candidate he backed in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race lost by 10 percentage points.",
      "Democrats in the swing state said Musk's comments show that a party-led effort in this spring\u2019s election, dubbed \u201c People vs. Musk, \u201d succeeded in making Musk and his money \u201ctoxic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people have won,\u201d said Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler. \u201cThe biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.\"",
      "Brandon Scholz, a retired longtime Republican strategist in the state, said that at least in Wisconsin, \u201cafter that court race he deserves to be labeled as toxic.\u201d",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Musk couldn\u2019t spend money on races in the state and nationally again, especially if the stakes are high and his money could make a difference, Scholz said.",
      "\u201cDoes he bring with him a lot of baggage? Possibly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cBut over time, maybe not as much.\"",
      "Musk's spending in this year's Wisconsin Supreme Court race helped make it the most expensive court race in U.S. history. And it came just five months after Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Donald Trump win, reversing losses in Wisconsin and other battleground states four years earlier.",
      "Musk was all-in on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, even making a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat \u2014 popular with fans of the NFL's Green Bay Packers \u2014 and personally handing out checks for $1 million to supporters. It was an extension of Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the presidential race, where he campaigned alongside Trump and headlined some of his own rallies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a super big deal,\u201d he told the roughly 2,000-person crowd in the event center, where hundreds of protesters were rallying against his appearance outside. \u201cI\u2019m not phoning it in. I\u2019m here in person.\u201d",
      "But his appearance \u2014 and money \u2014 didn\u2019t work.",
      "The candidate Musk backed lost Brown County, the home of Green Bay, by 3 percentage points, going on to lose statewide by more than three times that margin.",
      "After the defeat, Musk has said little publicly about the race and his involvement in it. His popularity has also plummeted.",
      "An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll taken two weeks after the Wisconsin court election found that just 33% of adults had a favorable view of the Tesla CEO, down from 41% in December.",
      "Musk's involvement in the race came at the same time he was the chain-saw-wielding face of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government.",
      "His Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, has enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending, in some cases seeking to shutter entire agencies, but it has fallen far short of its goals for reducing federal spending.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, is one of the most liberal members of Congress and a loud critic of both Trump and Musk.",
      "Pocan is skeptical that Musk truly will back away.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of it, first of all,\u201d Pocan said. \u201cThis just means they realize how toxic Elon Musk is and the work he did through DOGE.\u201d",
      "Kelda Roys, a Democratic state senator, was also tempered in her excitement over Musk saying he plans to do a \u201clot less\u201d political spending in the future.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of other billionaire bros, I\u2019m sure, willing and happy to step up in his place,\u201d Roys said.",
      "Musk could also get involved with future races, but in a much more low-profile way, said Scholz, the Republican.",
      "\u201cIn Wisconsin, he had such a huge, huge, huge profile,\u201d Scholz said. \"He became the campaign. He became the story.\u201d",
      "Musk spent at least $3 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race himself. Musk-backed groups America PAC and a Rebuilding America\u2019s Future spent another $19 million in support of the Republican-backed candidate Brad Schimel. That was part of more than $100 million spent on both sides.",
      "America PAC spent at least $6 million on vendors who sent door-to-door canvassers across the state, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It was a reprise of what the group did last fall across the seven most competitive presidential battleground states, including Wisconsin, which were carried by Trump.",
      "In addition to his political contributions, Musk paid three individual voters $1 million each for signing a petition in an effort to goose turnout. Musk also offered to pay $20 to anyone who signed up on his group\u2019s site to knock on doors for Schimel and posted a photo of themselves as proof. His organization promised $100 to every voter who signed the petition against \u201cactivist judges\u201d and another $100 for every signer they referred.",
      "Musk himself hosted Schimel on his podcast and cast what was at stake in stark terms.",
      "\u201cA seemingly small election could determine the fate of Western civilization,\u201d Musk said in a social media post on the April 1 election day. \u201cI think it matters for the future of the world.\u201d",
      "Democrats made the race a referendum on both Musk and Trump's agenda, successfully electing a judge whose victory ensures the Wisconsin Supreme Court will remain under liberal control until at least 2028.",
      "Coincidentally, Musk's announcement about spending less on political races came just hours after a liberal judge announced her candidacy for the 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court race.",
      "Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor is challenging a conservative incumbent justice who sided with Trump in his unsuccessful lawsuit that attempted to overturn his 2020 loss in Wisconsin. The race will be decided in April, months before the midterms in which Democrats hope unease with Trump and Musk will help the party make gains.",
      "Taylor appeared to be taking a similar approach to her campaign that the winning Democratic-backed candidate did this year.",
      "\u201cMy campaign is going to be a campaign about the people of this state,\" she told The Associated Press, \u201cnot about billionaires, not about the most powerful.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Millions of pensioners are not getting the winter fuel payment, after the government changed the rules.",
      "Payments are only going to those who already receive pension credit or other means-tested financial support.",
      "Pension credit tops up the state pension for those on low incomes, and is a gateway to other benefits like the winter fuel payment.",
      "After criticism of the government's limit on the payment, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signalled a partial reversal of the changes but did not provide details.",
      "What is the winter fuel payment and how have the rules changed?",
      "The winter fuel payment was previously paid to all pensioners to help with energy costs during the coldest period of the year.",
      "But in July 2024, the government said future payments in England and Wales would go only to those on low incomes who received specified benefits such as pension credit.",
      "The changes mean that more than 10 million pensioners did not receive a payment in winter 2024.",
      "Several charities, unions, and MPs criticised the decision to means-test the payment.",
      "They expressed concern about the number of older people living on a relatively small income who will miss out, and those who do not currently claim pension credit despite qualifying for it.",
      "It was also signalled as a source of voters' anger with the government at recent elections.",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment worth?",
      "The winter fuel payment is worth \u00a3200 for those on certain benefits and born between 23 September 1944 and 22 September 1958.",
      "For those born before 23 September 1944, and on certain benefits, it is worth \u00a3300.",
      "If you live with someone, and jointly claim benefits, only one of the couple receives the payment.",
      "How is the winter fuel payment linked to pension credit?",
      "Although the winter fuel payment is paid automatically, without a direct claim, the vast majority of those eligible will only receive the money if they have first registered to receive pension credit.",
      "This is a state pension top-up, which itself is worth thousands of pounds a year, and can be a gateway to other financial support, including a reduction in council tax, a free TV licence for those aged over 75, or help with NHS costs.",
      "However, an estimated 760,000 eligible pensioners fail to claim it.",
      "You could be eligible for pension credit if you are above state pension age and have an income of less that \u00a3218.15 a week, or less than \u00a3332.95 as a joint weekly income with your partner. Savings are also taken into account.",
      "Anyone entitled to pension credit for at least one day between 16 and 22 September 2024 received the winter fuel payment last winter.",
      "Disabled people, those caring for someone, or those with housing costs could still be eligible even if they have additional income or savings.",
      "You can check your eligibility for pension credit via the government's online calculator.",
      "Information is also available on how to make a claim online.",
      "When is the winter fuel payment made?",
      "The winter fuel payment is usually paid automatically in November or December. Those eligible receive a letter confirming their entitlement.",
      "Owing to the extra applications, some people had to wait for their claim to be processed. The Department for Work and Pensions said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "What will the rule change mean for the poorest pensioners?",
      "The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - about 15% - already live in relative poverty.",
      "This means their income is less than 60% of the median.",
      "The median income is the amount of money that divides a population into two, with half earning more, and half less.",
      "In November, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed the government expected significantly more pensioners to be in relative poverty due to the new rules:",
      "an extra 50,000 in the years ending March 2025, March 2026 and March 2028 an extra 100,000 in the years ending March 2027, March 2029 and March 2030",

      "The annual figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000 and do not take into account any increase in the take-up of pension credit.",
      "Writing to MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee, Kendall said means-testing winter fuel payments \"was not a decision this government wanted or expected to take\" but it was \"right that we target support to those who need it most\".",
      "Asked about the figures, Starmer said many pensioners would be better off from April 2025, when both the state pension and pension credit increased by 4.1%, under \"the triple lock\" arrangement.",
      "Meanwhile the Committee has launched its own inquiry into pensioner poverty \u2013 partly prompted by the winter fuel cut.",

    "story": [
      "US retail chain Target has slashed its expectations for the year after a sharp fall in sales which it blamed on a \"highly challenging environment\" amid the introduction of trade tariffs.",
      "Its sales slumped by 5.7% in the three months to May, at a time when the company also faced a backlash following a previous decision to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets.",
      "Bosses declined to confirm any potential price rises due to higher import taxes, saying raising prices could be a \"last resort.\"",
      "Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, said pricing decisions would depend on the retailer's efforts to source more products in the US and reduce its reliance on China.",
      "\"That is going to play a very important role,\" he said following the company's results.",
      "Unlike its rival Walmart, which generates the bulk of its revenues from selling grocery items like bananas, milk, toilet paper, and shampoo, Target's big sellers are mostly in non-essential goods, such as home furniture and beauty products.",
      "It sources the majority of such products from China, with 30% of its store-label goods from the country. That is down from 60% in 2017, but analysts have said the impact of higher import tariffs on goods from the country will be difficult to navigate.",
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many countries since returning to the White House in an attempt to encourage businesses and consumers to buy more American-made goods.",
      "Trump hopes his policy will help boost US manufacturing and jobs but economists have warned it could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries, which has de-escalated the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, but US import taxes on Chinese remain higher than before at 30%.",
      "What does the US-China tariff deal mean?",
      "Target sales suffer after Pride month backlash",
      "Rick Gomez, the company's chief commercial officer, said Target was looking to negotiate with suppliers and expand the number of its suppliers beyond China, as well as adjusting the timing and quantity of orders.",
      "\"These efforts are expected to offset the vast majority of the incremental tariff exposure,\" he said.",
      "Walmart revealed last week it it would raise prices due to tariffs, which prompted Trump to say the supermarket should \"eat the tariffs\" on imported goods instead of passing on costs.",
      "Target said on Wednesday it now expects a low-single digit decline in annual sales. It previously forecast net sales growth of around 1%.",
      "In January, Target announced it was ending its DEI targets.",
      "The Trump administration is opposed to such policies, which has resulted in a host of major firms cutting back on initiatives.",
      "The chain was sued by a group of shareholders earlier this year, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who argued Target had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies.",
      "The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop, and led to boycotts.",
      "Mr Cornell said the reversal of some DEI policies played a role in first-quarter performance, but that he could not quantify the impact."

    "story": [
      "Flying home from his Gulf trip last week, President Donald Trump told reporters \"that was a great four days, historic four days\".",
      "Visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), he added in this trademark swagger that \"the jobs and money coming into our countries, there has never been anything like it\".",
      "Trump claimed that he was able to secure deals totalling more than $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) for the US, but do the numbers add up?",
      "The trip itself was an extravaganza, with the three Gulf states pulling out all the stops.",
      "Escorts of fighter jets, extravagant welcoming ceremonies, a thundering 21-gun salute, a fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks, royal camels, Arabian horses, and sword dancers were all part of the pageantry.",
      "The UAE also awarded Mr Trump the country's highest civilian honour, the Order of Zayed.",
      "The visit's optics were striking; the region's richest petrostates flaunted their opulence, revealing just how much of that fortune they were ready to deploy to strengthen ties with the US while advancing their own economic goals.",
      "Ros Atkins on... Trump's deals in the Gulf",
      "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US",
      "What did Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia reveal?",
      "Before embarking on the trip, President Trump, who touts himself as a \"dealmaker in chief\" was clear that the main objective of the trip was to land investments worth billions of dollars. On the face of it, he succeeded.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated a pledge to invest $600bn in US-Saudi partnerships. There were a plethora of deals announced as part of this, encompassing arms, artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, infrastructure projects and science collaborations, and various security ties and initiatives.",
      "The $142bn defence deal grabbed a lot of the attention as it was described by the White House as the largest arms deal ever.",
      "However, there remains some doubt as to whether those investment figures are realistic.",
      "During his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump had announced that Saudi Arabia had agreed to $450bn in deals with the US.",
      "But actual trade and investment flows amounted to less than $300bn between 2017 to 2020, according to data compiled by the Arab Gulf States Institute.",
      "The report was authored by Tim Callen, the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission chief to Saudi Arabia, and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute.",
      "\"The proof with all of these [new] deals will be in the pudding,\" says Mr Callen.",
      "The BBC contacted the White House for comment.",
      "In Qatar, Trump announced an \"economic exchange\" worth at least $1.2tn. However, in the fact sheet released by the White House deals worth only $243.5bn between the two countries were mentioned.",
      "One of the Qatari agreements that was confirmed was Qatar Airways purchasing up to 210 passenger jets for $96bn from the beleaguered American aircraft manufacturer Boeing.",
      "The White House said the deal would support 154,000 jobs in the US each year of their production, totalling one million jobs over the deal's lifecycle.",
      "Meanwhile, the UAE inked an agreement to construct the world's largest AI campus outside the US, reportedly granting it access to 500,000 cutting edge microchips from US giant Nvidia, starting next year.",
      "This project sits within the UAE's broader pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade.",
      "As well as the challenge of delivering what is promised, another potential obstacle to these figures being realised are oil prices.",
      "Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low in April amid growing concerns that Trump's tariffs could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.",
      "For Saudi Arabia, the fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained its finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.",
      "Last month, the IMF cut the forecast for the world's largest oil exporter's GDP growth in 2025 to 3% from its previous estimate of 3.3%.",
      "\"It's going to be very hard for Saudi to come up with that sort of money [the $600bn announced] in the current oil price environment,\" Mr Callen adds.",
      "Other analysts note that a lot of the agreements signed during the trip were non-binding memorandums of understanding, which are less formal than contracts, and do not always translate into actual transactions. And some of the deals included in the agreement were announced earlier.",
      "Saudi oil firm Aramco, for instance, announced 34 agreements with US companies valued at up to $90bn. However, most were non-binding memorandums of understanding without specified monetary commitments.",
      "And its agreement to purchase 1.2 million tonnes of liquified natural gas annually for 20 years from US firm NextDecade was also included in the list of new deals, despite it first being announced months ago.",
      "Yet the massive investments mark a continuation of the shift in the US-Gulf relationship away from oil-for-security to stronger economic partnerships rooted in bilateral investments.",
      "Bader Al Saif, an assistant professor at Kuwait University and an associate fellow at think tank Chatham House, says that the deals indicate that US and the Gulf states are \"planning the future together and that was a significant change for the relationship\".",
      "He adds that the AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia were central to this as \"they clearly demonstrate that they are trying to see how to build the new global order and the new way of doing things together\".",
      "This emphasis on AI underscores the growing strategic importance of the technology to US diplomacy. Trump was accompanied on the trip by Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Elon Musk, who owns Grok AI.",
      "And on the eve of the visit, the White House scrapped tough Biden-era restrictions on exports of the advanced US semiconductors required to best run AI systems. The rules had divided the world into tiers, with some countries enjoying broad access to its high-end chips, and others being denied them altogether.",
      "About 120 countries, including the Gulf nations, were grouped in the middle, facing strict caps on the number of semiconductors they could import. This had frustrated countries such as Saudi Arabia, who have ambitions to become high-tech economies as they transition away from oil.",
      "Both Saudi and the UAE are racing to build large-scale AI data centres, while Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, aims to become a global AI hub.",
      "The UAE has made visible efforts to reassure Washington \u2013 deepening partnerships with US tech firms, curbing ties with Chinese companies, and aligning more closely with American national security interests.",
      "Mr Al-Saif says that the UAE is \"betting on the Americans when it comes to AI\". \"We have seen that the technological turn in the 90s came from the US anyway.\"",
      "Both camps are hailing the visit as a triumph. For the Gulf, and especially Saudi Arabia, it resets a partnership that frayed under Biden, and underscores their ambition to act as heavyweight players on the world stage.",
      "For Trump, touting \"trillions\" in new investment offers a timely boost - his tariff hikes have dented global trade and pushed US output into its first quarterly dip in three years.",
      "These Gulf deals will be sold as proof that his economic playbook is working.",
      "At the end of the trip, Mr Trump worried that whoever succeeds him in the White House would claim credit for the deals once they come to completion.",
      "\"I'll be sitting home, who the hell knows where I'll be, and I'll say, 'I did that,'\" he said.",

      "What has been much less clear is who is responsible, with the companies and authorities only giving limited details.",
      "But, now - in their first interview - the National Crime Agency (NCA) has indicated where their suspicions lie, and named the notorious cyber-criminal collective Scattered Spider as a key part of their investigation.",
      "The group is eye-catching for a number of reasons. Firstly, they are young, some of them teenagers. And second they are known to be native English speakers - the most high profile cyber criminals tend to come from other countries, such as Russia and North Korea.",
      "There has speculation they have been involved in the UK retail hacks - but this is the first time the police have confirmed that possibility is being actively investigated.",
      "\"We are looking at the group that is publicly known as Scattered Spider, but we've got a range of different hypotheses and we'll follow the evidence to get to the offenders,\" Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber-crime unit, said in a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"In light of all the damage that we're seeing, catching whoever is behind these attacks is our top priority,\" he added.",

      "Some cyber-experts say the hackers display the traits of Scattered Spider, a loose community of often young individuals who organise across sites like Discord, Telegram and in forums, most likely located in the UK and US.",
      "Although the NCA says it is exploring all parts of the cyber-crime ecosystem, it too is looking in the same direction.",
      "\"We know that Scattered Spider are largely English-speaking but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the UK - we know that they communicate online amongst themselves in a range of different platforms and channels, which is, I guess, key to their ability to then be able to operate as a collective,\" Mr Foster said.",

      "\"After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment,\" McFadden added.",
      "Monday's deal between the UK and the EU says there will be \"no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)\".",
      "The prime minister's official spokesperson said that the UK would \"be working with member states to roll that out as quickly as possible\", adding that \"talks have started with individual EU nations\".",
      "An EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES would open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders.",
      "\"Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system.\"",
      "Some EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer.",
      "Speaking about the agreement on Tuesday with supermarket workers, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They were excited about the e-gates and being able to go on their holidays, which they have obviously already planned, and not be in the horrendously long queues. \"",
      "Surprise inclusion",
      "The inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October.",
      "Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said:",
      "\"This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch.\"",
      "Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp.",
      "The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp.",
      "The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station."

      "Last year, 4.6 billion such parcels entered the EU, with more than 90% coming from China.",
      "Such a volume had created a huge workload for EU customs staff, Sefcovic said. He argued it had presented challenges in ensuring the safety and standard of goods entering the bloc was properly checked.",
      "The proposed fee would \"compensate the cost\", he told the European Parliament. Brussels also hopes some of the revenue generated will go towards the EU budget.",

      "Some Labour MPs have blamed the winter fuel policy for the party's losses at last month's local elections, and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election.",
      "Simply abandoning the policy entirely is seen as a less likely outcome than adjusting the thresholds.",

      "The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners.",

    "story": [
      "Sneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up.",
      "Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling.",
      "Rising temperatures are even worse for outdoor workers. \"This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,\" Ms Sachar says.",
      "She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.",
      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",

      "This is a problem with a long history.",
      "In his ground-breaking novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Colombia's Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez famously highlighted the massacre of workers on banana plantations in the country in the 1920s.",
      "The Labour Ministry says that since the early 1970s, well over 3,000 trade unionists have been murdered in Colombia.",
      "And even though the nation is more peaceful than it once was, the attacks continue.",
      "\"For many years now already, unfortunately, Colombia is the deadliest country in the world for trade unionists and for trade union work,\" says Luc Triangle, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a global umbrella organization based in Brussels.",
      "Every year the ITUC publishes a survey of the atrocities carried out against trade unionists around the world. Its most recent edition covers the year to the end of March 2024.",
      "It found that in those 12 months, 22 trade unionists were killed for their activism around the world. Eleven of them were murdered in Colombia.",
      "\"Generally, these are targeted murders,\" Mr Triangle says. \"They know what they are doing. They know who they want to murder.",
      "\"It's not targeting the big bosses of the trade unions or the leaders. They are targeting in small villages people that are doing active trade union work.",
      "\"Between 2020 and 2023, we recorded 45 murders in Colombia. In 2022, 29 murders. It's less violent than it once was, but it's still very violent, certainly if you compare it with other countries.\"",
      "Why is this happening?",
      "Fabio Arias, the head of Colombia's largest trade union federation, the CUT, says it is all part of Colombia's long and complex civil conflict, which pitted left-wing rebel groups against right-wing paramilitaries, drug traffickers and the Colombian state, and which still rumbles on in some parts of the country.",
      "\"The trade union movement has always been linked to the parties of the left and unfortunately the many right-wing governments we've had in Colombia have always claimed that anyone who is a leftist is a guerrilla, a terrorist,\" Mr Arias says.",
      "\"And once you've established that, then people feel justified in attacking them.\"",
      "He says the attacks on workers are also linked to Colombia's illegal economies, notably the cocaine trade and illegal mining.",
      "\"If you look at where these attacks are happening, it's in the departments of Cauca, Nari\u00f1o, Putumayo, Arauca, Norte de Santander and Caquet\u00e1, because that's where the biggest coca plantations are, and where the illegal mining is.\"",
      "It is not clear who is carrying out these killings and who is ordering them. Some trade unionists blame the private sector, saying businesses, desperate to stifle any attempt by workers to organize, are paying armed groups to carry out these atrocities.",
      "They point to the fact that threats and attacks tend to spike at times when businesses and unions are in wage negotiations.",
      "But as many of the attacks go unpunished, it is difficult to know who exactly is to blame.",
      "\"In the Cauca Valley there are so many different armed groups you never really know who's behind the attacks, who's carrying them out, who's ordering them,\" says Zen\u00f3n Escobar, another sugar cane worker and local representative of Sintrainagro.",

      "Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.",
      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",

He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",

      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",

      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try to limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "In 2023 the BBC reported on a mother who had to spend more than \u00a330,000 to protect her small daughter. Her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, but kept parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "Her parents said they were \"very disappointed\". The government said it was \"the beginning of legal change in this area and not the end\".",

      "Although her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, and was banned from contact with other children, he retained parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "That meant that he could have a say over her education, decisions about her health, and where she would live.",
      "He could also in future have contact with his daughter. In fact, he told the court from prison via a videolink, he was already writing letters every week to the little girl. He wasn't allowed to send them.",
      "At the end of the hearings, the judge granted the mother's application, removing the father's parental rights and barring him from all contact, including on social media, until the child turns 18.",
      "The family were pleased - but it had cost them over \u00a330,000 in legal fees.",
      "Harriet Harman, who is now in the Lords but was then an MP, heard my report, and decided to try to change the law, to remove what she called this \"glaring anomaly\".",

      "Families like Bethan's would no longer need to go to the Family Court.",
      "In April 2024 the Conservative Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk supported this change for the most serious cases, where children had been raped.",
      "\"This new law will ensure they are automatically safeguarded against those whose despicable actions have shown them to utterly lack any nurturing and caring instincts,\" he said at the time.",
      "Bethan and her parents were delighted.",
      "But the government called the July election - and the law didn't change.",
      "In the most recent King's Speech, in 2024, the Labour government promised to enact the change, saying it would restrict parental responsibility for child sex offenders.",
      "However, when the wording of the new law was published on 7 May it said that removing parental responsibility would only apply \"for a serious sexual offence committed against a child for whom the offender has parental responsibility\".",

      "The draft legislation - which had its second reading in Parliament today - also says the restriction of parental responsibility should apply only where someone has been sentenced to at least four years in prison.",
      "The grandparents of Bethan's child believe it should apply more widely.",
      "\"Really what we're talking about here is where the line is drawn. And we obviously think that line should be drawn much lower down,\" the child's grandfather said.",
      "The grandmother said the court case had been a \"terrible stress\" for her daughter.",
      "\"What people don't realise is when you take on a family court case, it's like taking on a full time job because it takes hundreds of hours to get the information together,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Bethan had to take her child out of childcare, give up her flat, and \"use every bit of savings\" she had to pay for the family court, the child's grandmother added.",
      "Victims minister Alex Davies-Jones said in response: \"We are protecting children and ensuring victims are properly supported.",
      "\"These changes will, for the first time, introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility for offenders who sexually abuse their own child and receive a prison sentence of four years or more - removing the need for victims to go through court to secure this.",

      "The number of incidents of racism or racist bullying recorded in Scotland's schools increased by 50% last year, figures obtained by BBC Scotland News reveal.",
      "According to Freedom of Information (FoI) requests to all 32 councils there were more than 3,600 incidents last year, compared to 2,400 the year before.",
      "Campaigners say the true figure will be far higher as councils are not complying with Scottish government guidance to log all incidents properly.",
      "The Scottish government said one of the reasons for the increase could be improved reporting.",
      "Ekta's daughter Anisa was only seven when she started getting taunted for the colour of her skin.",
      "Her mother says Anisa became quiet and withdrawn at home and she could not understand what was the matter.",
      "It was only months later that Anisa broke down in tears and alerted her mother to what was going on.",
      "Ekta says she immediately went to the headteacher and a child was asked to apologise to her daughter.",
      "She says the school asked her daughter to accept the apology but in the following months the bullying and racism continued.",
      "Ekta told the BBC she offered multiple times to work with the school to help with their understanding of racism but they never took her up on those offers.",
      "Last October, two years after the initial incident, Anisa told her mother she could no longer go to the school and she was moved.",
      "Their experience is not an isolated one.",
      "Figures obtained by BBC Scotland News show a large increase in incidents of racism and racist bullying recorded in schools.",
      "Campaigners said some issues are not recorded at all and others are logged as bullying instead of racism.",
      "In its FoI response, Highland Council admitted that not all its schools were recording racist incidents on the school recording system, SEEMIS.",
      "Research by watchdog Education Scotland also previously suggested many schools were also not using SEEMIS properly for recording bullying incidents.",
      "Racist comments",
      "Ekta told BBC News that before the incidents her daughter was \"bubbly, confident and outgoing\".",
      "\"When the racism began she started questioning things \u2013 why am I being told I'm different? Why am I being told the colour of my skin means people don't want to talk to me?,\" Ekta said.",
      "\"I don't send my child to school to be abused or be a victim of racism. I send her to school to learn and be safe.\"",
      "When Ekta approached the school she says she was told they had not had to deal with racism before and were not clear how to handle it.",
      "Ekta said a child who had made a number of racist comments was asked to apologise but the school did not seem to think wider learning was necessary.",
      "She thinks the school failed to meet its legal and ethical duties.",
      "For Ekta it brought back memories of the racism she faced when growing up in Bearsden, north of Glasgow, decades ago.",
      "\"I thought that 30 years down the line it would have stopped or at least that the systems would be better to address some of these things,\" she said.",
      "She said she felt the school managers failed to take the issue seriously and the bullying and racism continued.",
      "Ekta says she later found out that the school logged the incidents as bullying not racism.",
      "She raised an official complaint with East Dunbartonshire Council, where the school is located, and received a partial apology.",
      "But she feels they have not changed their approach, training or systems and not properly understood the problem.",
      "She is now pursuing her claim through the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO).",
      "Meanwhile, her daughter is at a new primary school with a new group of friends and her mother said she is happy.",
      "Is racism on the increase?",
      "The Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights (CRER) in Scotland says statistics from other organisations including the police suggest there has been an increase in racist incidents.",
      "But they have also found evidence that many incidents in schools are not recorded.",
      "Last year they set up AdRESS \u2013 Advocates for Race Equality in Schools Scotland - to support parents and carers who have a child going through racism at school.",
      "Kwaku Adjei, the education advocacy officer for CRER and head advisor for AdRESS, said hate crime reports had gone up but it was also apparent from research that the true figure should be a lot higher.",
      "\"Our previous research in 2022 indicated that 85% of schools are not reporting incidences that have been reported to them,\" he said.",
      "\"If we're not recording them, how do we know that the incident is being dealt with in any way?\"",
      "Mr Adjei said that just asking a child to apologise would not help tackle the underlying problem.",
      "He said: \"We need to ensure that they are educated and told about why it was wrong to display that kind of behaviour, the impact it can do and see from there if there's any form of reconciliation.",
      "\"Then people will learn why it's wrong and how to not exhibit those behaviours.\"",
      "Mr Adjei said one of the reason incidents were increasing could be that racist behaviour is \"not being challenged\".",
      "Another factor could be some of the toxic content on social media, he said.",
      "\"We need to ensure that they are challenged if you're hearing anything,\" Mr Adjei said.",
      "\"It could something as like a joke. It could microaggressions.\"",
      "CRER are calling for mandatory logging of racist incidents and bullying in schools. They say there is not enough training available for teachers.",
      "In Glasgow's east end, pupils at St Francis of Assisi Primary School have written their own anti-racism charter and set up their own equalities group.",
      "They wrote their own charter after realising the council charter wasn't in \"child friendly language\".",
      "The work came about after head teacher Ciara Henderson decided to attend a new course in leading an anti-racist establishment at the University of Glasgow.",
      "She said: \"We had a small number of racist incidents last year and speaking with colleagues across Glasgow and across my learning community I had recognised there was an rise in racist incidents.",
      "\"We were hearing language and terminology that we hadn't heard for a very long time.",
      "\"I thought I really want to tackle this head-on. It's not acceptable. I don't want this for the children in my school.",
      "\"The first starting point was looking at the professional development I could do around that in order to be able to empower the children in my school.",
      "\"Racism is a systemic, cultural, societal issues that we all need to be involved in order to instigate change and empower change.\"",
      "No place for racism",
      "The Scottish government said improved reporting could be a factor in the rise but added there was \"no place for racism\" in schools.",
      "A spokesman said: \"It is deeply concerning that so many people in Scotland continue to face racial discrimination.\"",
      "He added: \"Diversity and equality are at the heart of policies that underpin education in Scotland.",
      "\"Incidents of discrimination or prejudice must be addressed whenever they arise.",
      "\"It is important that we are vigilant in challenging any racist behaviour in Scotland's schools.",
      "The Scottish government will publish new guidance for schools on responding to racist incidents, including guidance on recording and monitoring in the coming weeks.",
      "Ann Davie, the chief executive of East Dunbartonshire Council, where Anisa went to school, said it takes racism and bullying very seriously.",
      "She said there was a standardised approach to ensuring educational establishments create safe and inclusive learning environments that celebrate diversity for all children and young people.",
      "\"Teachers and school staff are offered very clear guidance and professional learning relating to Bullying and Equalities and there is a clear expectation that all staff have a shared understanding of bullying, including racism, and the skills to respond effectively,\" Ms Davie said.",
      "\"We work with schools to ensure these incidents are reported timeously and action is taken to address any needs identified.\"",
      "Local government body Cosla  said racism in schools in any form was \"unacceptable\" and councils are committed to \"ensure everyone is able to learn in a welcoming and safe environment\".",
      "A spokesperson said: \"In recent years, awareness of what constitutes a racist incident has increased, as has our understanding of the impacts.",
      "\"As work within schools has progressed in recent years, there is now a greater confidence in reporting, and councils will continue in their efforts with staff, children, young people, families, partners and their wider communities to make further progress.\""

    "published": "Thu, 15 May 2025 15:09:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says \"every single penny\" raised by the policy will be spent on state schools.",
    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Those that have a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names a specific private school that can meet their needs do not have to pay VAT.",
      "The government also said a grant to help cover the boarding school fees for children of military families was increased to take account of the VAT increase.",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Have private school fees gone up?",
      "The ISC represents more than 1,400 private schools. It said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024.",
      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

    "summary": "Mushtaq has become the first author writing in Kannada to win the prize for her short story collection Heart Lamp",
    "story": [
      "Indian writer, lawyer and activist Banu Mushtaq has made history by becoming the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker prize with her short story anthology, Heart Lamp.",
      "It is the first short story collection to win the presigious prize. Judges praised her characters as \"astonishing portraits of survival and resilience\".",
      "Featuring 12 short stories written by Mushtaq between 1990 and 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.",
      "The stories were selected and translated into English from Kannada, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, by Deepa Bhasthi who will share the \u00a350,000 prize.",
      "In her acceptance speech, Mushtaq thanked readers for letting her words wander into their hearts.",
      "\"This book was born from the belief that no story is ever small; that in the tapestry of human experience, every thread holds the weight of the whole,\" she said.",
      "\"In a world that often tries to divide us, literature remains one of the last sacred spaces where we can live inside each other's minds, if only for a few pages,\" she added.",
      "Bhasthi, who became the first Indian translator to win an International Booker, said that she hoped that the win would encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.",
      "Manasi Subramaniam, Editor-in-chief of Penguin India, the book's publisher in India, told the BBC that the award was a significant win for regional literature.",
      "\"Following Tomb of Sand's landmark win in 2022 [Geetanjali Shree's book was translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell], Heart Lamp's triumph this year is a powerful reminder that literature in India's many languages demands our full attention. We owe it our ears,\" said Subramaniam",
      "Mushtaq's body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.",
      "It is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plotlines.",
      "\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.",
      "Who is Banu Mushtaq?",
      "Mushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school.",
      "But her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada.",
      "Mushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression.",
      "She began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.",
      "It would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.",
      "Her short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.",
      "In an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".",
      "In the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house.",
      "Then, a shocking act of defiance set her free.",
      "\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.",
      "What does Banu Mushtaq write about?",
      "In Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.",
      "\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back \u2014 not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to a review of the book in The Indian Express newspaper.",
      "Mushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.",
      "After leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.",
      "In a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel.",
      "But her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.",
      "In an interview to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques.",
      "A fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.",
      "But these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.",
      "\"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" she told The Week magazine.",
      "Over the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.",
      "In 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.",

      "Actor union Sag-Aftra has filed a complaint over the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to recreate the voice of Star Wars villain Darth Vader in Fortnite.",
      "The union said Llama Productions - a subsidiary of Epic, which makes the hit video game - had chosen \"to replace the work of human performers with AI technology\".",
      "It has alleged the company did so without informing the union of its intentions or bargaining over terms.",
      "The BBC has approached Epic Games for comment.",
      "The union's Unfair Labour Practice complaint, filed to the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleges that the company made \"unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilising AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work\".",
      "It said this amounted to a failure by the employer to \"bargain in good faith\".",
      "In the game, players can fight against Darth Vader, recruit the character to their team and interact with it.",

      "An attached statement from the actor's family said he \"felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars\" and \"always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it\".",
      "\"We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character,\" they added.",

      "\"We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games,\" it said.",
      "The complaint comes against the backdrop of video game and voice actors growing increasingly concerned over the use of AI to reduce their work or replace them altogether.",
      "Hollywood actors such as Scarlett Johansson have also highlighted concerns over how their digital likeness could be manipulated using generative AI.",
      "Sag-Aftra, which represents actors across gaming, film, television and radio, has been continuing to try and reach agreements on terms around video game voice actors rights since strikes began last year.",
      "Voice actors connected to the SAG-Aftra union have been refusing to work with companies like Activision, Disney, Warner Bros and EA since July over issues such as the use of generative artificial intelligence.",
      "These included assurances over the use of digital replicas in video games.",
      "There are also worries the AI-powered tech could be misused.",

      "This is a sorry end to a long BBC career. Gary Lineker was among the corporation's highest-paid presenters for a reason - he is popular with audiences, knowledgeable and brilliant at his job.",
      "But it's an understatement to suggest he has also caused problems for his BBC bosses over the years, as their high-profile football host began to morph into a presenter with opinions that he voiced on social media.",
      "In the end, those two things were increasingly in conflict.",
      "This has always been about reputation management for the BBC. Lineker had already, in the eyes of BBC bosses, caused the corporation damage with previous social media posts. Mistakenly sharing a video about Zionism which included a rat emoji was the final straw.",
      "It was difficult to see how he could continue presenting for the corporation, particularly at a time when the BBC is enmeshed in another controversy surrounding a documentary about Gaza, which it pulled after discovering the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "I think what's different is that on this occasion, Lineker regrets his actions. He has appeared bullish about previous posts, saying that while he regretted damaging the BBC, he didn't believe, for example, that comparing the language of a Conservative asylum policy to that of 1930s Germany was wrong.",
      "Lineker is genuinely upset by what happened. He is mortified that he reposted the video. His relationship with the BBC is coming to an end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted.",
      "He seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his high profile might prevent him from voicing strongly-held views that many believed had an impact on the BBC's need for impartiality.",
      "We live increasingly in an age when people want to express their opinions, and often do. Social media has given everyone a platform, and high-profile media figures have huge followings.",
      "He could not keep quiet. In the end, it brought him down.",
      "But he is a successful podcast entrepreneur, owning a third of the shares in Goalhanger, the company behind hit shows including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics.",
      "I would also not be surprised if he does appear in the future on TV, perhaps even as a presenter of the World Cup for another outlet.",

      "Gary Lineker, who will leave the BBC after hosting his final Match of the Day on Sunday, was the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As the face of the corporation's flagship football show for 26 years, he was also one of the its highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million in 2023.",
      "But last November's agreement between Lineker and the BBC that he'd stop hosting Match of the Day, and continue to front the FA Cup and World Cup into  2026, is in tatters.",
      "It follows last week's controversy when he shared a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.",
      "He immediately deleted it after criticism, saying he was unaware of the image's symbolism, and later said he \"apologised unreservedly\".",
      "But the ensuing headlines will not be the ones Lineker will have wanted or anticipated for his final weeks at the BBC - he'd worked hard for years to build up his reputation as a stellar broadcaster.",

      "Live updates: Gary Lineker to leave the BBC after social media 'error'",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft after his successful football career.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told BBC Radio 4's Media Show in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\".",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker fronting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June last year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March 2023, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "Mr Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February last year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "In February 2025, Lineker made headlines when he was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.",
      "The documentary was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the film while it carried out further due diligence. The corporation has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of the film and the matter is still subject to an internal investigation.",
      "Last month, Lineker spoke to BBC presenter Amol Rajan, and was asked about the comments he posted on social media in March 2023.",
      "Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "However it appears that the latest round of headlines about the sports presenter made his position untenable.",
      "Despite his BBC career being cut even shorter, Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at last year's Podcast Awards.",
      "At the recent Arias radio awards, Goalhanger was named audio brand of the year.",
      "The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, is also on BBC Sounds.",
      "Lineker will be replaced on Match of the Day by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season.",
      "He indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now\" and \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world\".",

    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",
      "\"The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,\" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.",

      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",

      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",

      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",

      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?",
      "The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution - all of which he has vehemently denied.",
      "Surrounded by his children and dozens of family and friends, Mr Combs has watched Ms Ventura from his chair at the defence table just a few dozen feet away.",
      "All the while, US District Judge Arun Subramanian has pushed attorneys to stay on schedule, as prosecutors have expressed worry their star witness could go into labour with her third child as soon as this weekend.",
      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",
      "Consent vs compliance: Prosecutors build their sex trafficking case",
      "Get all the latest trial updates on the BBC Sounds 'Diddy on Trial' podcast available wherever you get your BBC podcasts.",
      "Throughout Ms Ventura's harrowing story of domestic violence, prosecutors have tried to thread in elements of their larger sex trafficking and racketeering case against Mr Combs.",
      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Arick Fudali, a lawyer who represents an unnamed victim in the government's case against Mr Combs, said \"the fear of what would happen if they didn't comply\" is a crucial element of the government's case.",
      "\"Someone can consent to a sexual act of course,\" Mr Fudali told the BBC. \"But someone can also be coerced into being compliant, and that's different.\"",
      "The government has also used Ms Ventura's testimony to try to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.",
      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",
      "\"Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,\" he says.",
      "Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at \u00a314.99 a month.",
      "There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price.",
      "Game Pass players could pay a \u00a334.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "The case calling for a full judicial review was brought after the NHS announced in December last year that under-18s would no longer be prescribed puberty blockers at gender identity clinics.",
      "Campaigners argued that the prescription of cross-sex hormones should also be addressed and criticised the government's failure to intervene.",
      "But Lady Justice Whipple said it was not \"unreasonable or irrational\" for the government to address the question of puberty blockers first and later come to cross-sex hormones.",
      "The court in London was also told health officials are looking at \"alternative legal mechanisms\" to tackle issues around private and overseas providers who prescribe such drugs.",
      "Cross-sex hormones are given to people who identify as a gender that is different to their biological sex. The medication helps someone who is transitioning to develop characteristics associated with their preferred gender.",
      "For instance, it would help a trans man, a biological female who identifies as a man, develop a deeper voice and facial hair. Existing NHS guidance allows the hormones to be prescribed people aged 16 and over.",
      "They differ from puberty blockers, which stop the onset of puberty by suppressing the release of hormones.",
      "Existing NHS guidance allows the hormones to be prescribed to people aged 16 and over.",
      "The case calling for a full judicial review was brought by Keira Bell and two others, who are remaining anonymous.",
      "They wanted a ban on the prescription of cross-sex hormones by non-NHS organisations, such as private clinics and overseas providers.",
      "As a teenager, Ms Bell was given cross-sex hormones after attending the now closed NHS Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) run by the Tavistock clinic.",
      "At the time she identified as male, but says she deeply regrets the decision to take medication that altered her body permanently.",
      "Responding to this afternoon's judgment she said: \"I am relieved that the secretary of state is now actively considering a ban on cross-sex hormones outside of the NHS.",
      "\"These powerful drugs should not be given to children and young people.\"",
      "Her barrister, Zoe Gannon, had argued that while the health secretary banned the private prescription of puberty suppressing drugs in gender cases involving under-18s, he had \"failed or refused\" to take the same action in relation to cross-sex hormones, and this was \"irrational\".",
      "Iain Steele, barrister for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), told the court Mr Streeting \"is currently seeking clinical and expert advice from NHS England\".",
      "He also said there were a wide range of medical uses for hormones, such as testosterone and oestrogen, which made decisions on whether to restrict or ban their use in different situations complex.",
      "Delivering the judgment rejecting the application for a judicial review, Lady Justice Whipple, sitting with Mr Justice Johnson, said the secretary of state had acted rationally.",
      "She said, \"This is an immensely difficult and sensitive area of policy formation where there are strong and genuinely held views on each side of the debate and where there is no consensus.\"",
      "She added Mr Streeting was taking practical steps and was therefore entitled to more time to consider the issues.",
      "She continued that it was appropriate that there was an active review and that was to be welcomed.",
      "A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said children's healthcare \"must always be led by evidence\".",
      "\"That is why this government is implementing the recommendations from the Cass Review and acted immediately to extend the puberty blockers ban and make it permanent.\"",

    "story": [
      "West Nile virus, which mainly spreads between birds but can also infect people if they're bitten by an infected mosquito, has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, UK health officials say.",
      "Although the virus can sometimes make people seriously ill, there is no evidence it is spreading in the UK and the risk to the general public is \"very low\", the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.",
      "The virus is found in many parts of the world, including Africa, South America and mainland Europe.",
      "Climate change and other factors have been pushing mosquitoes - and the diseases they carry - further north in recent years.",
      "West Nile virus causes either very minor symptoms or none at all - but around 20% of infected people can experience headaches, high fever and skin issues. In rare cases, it can kill through serious brain illnesses, including encephalitis or meningitis.",
      "No specific treatment or vaccines exist for humans.",
      "To date, there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK - although, since 2000, there have been seven cases of the disease linked to travel to other countries.",
      "West Nile virus is usually present in several regions across the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, South America and Europe, and has expanded in recent years.",
      "Research by the UKHSA and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) found fragments of the virus in mosquitoes collected at ponds near Retford, Nottinghamshire in 2023.",
      "\"While this is the first detection of West Nile Virus in mosquitoes in the UK so far, it is not unexpected as the virus is already widespread in Europe,\" said Dr Meera Chand, a deputy director for travel health and infections at UKHSA.",
      "Dr Arran Folly, who led the project which found the virus, said its detection is part of a \"wider changing landscape, where, in the wake of climate change mosquito-borne diseases are expanding to new areas\".",
      "While the Aedes vexans mosquito is native to Britain, he added that warming temperatures may bring non-native species to the UK and, with them, the potential of infectious disease.",
      "Prof James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the development was \"serious\" but there was no need for the public to be alarmed.",
      "He said surveillance systems were in place to monitor increased mosquito activity and shifting bird migration caused by warmer weather.",
      "\"But as conditions change, we need to stay one step ahead,\" he said.",
      "\"This is a moment to recognise that the UK is no longer immune to some diseases once considered 'tropical'.\"",
      "Prof Logan said the virus is likely to have arrived via an infected bird or mosquito, which can both travel considerable distances during seasonal migration.",
      "Infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans, he said, but there was \"no evidence of human infection acquired in the UK\".",
      "\"However, the detection of the virus in mosquitoes marks a significant step in that direction,\" he added.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of infectious disease ecology at Glasgow University, said several mosquito species native the UK were \"known to be capable for transmitting the virus\", but do not do so at present because the conditions, such as temperature, \"are not favourable\".",
      "But she said this could change in the future, which is why lots of monitoring, testing and surveillance is always needed.",
      "The affected mosquito, one of many thousands of species of mosquito, is often found in wet areas. Experts recommend getting rid of standing water sources where they breed, and taking personal measures such as using mosquito repellent and bed nets.",
      "Last year, protests were held in Seville, Spain, after the death of five people infected with the disease.",

      "Most cases are treated with a single dose of antibiotics, but there is an 80-year history of the bacterium which causes gonorrhoea repeatedly evolving resistance to our antibiotics.",
      "It's happening to the current treatments too and is why some doctors are concerned gonorrhoea could one-day become untreatable.",
      "The best way to deal with a drug-resistant infection is to never catch it in the first place.",
      "Dr Amanda Doyle, from NHS England, said: \"The launch of a world-first routine vaccination for gonorrhoea is a huge step forward for sexual health and will be crucial in protecting individuals, helping to prevent the spread of\u202finfection and reduce the rising rates of antibiotic resistant strains of the bacteria.\"",

      "Listen to this article",
      "\"Whenever I was struggling, if it was going to be a really bad day, I could then start to chat to one of these bots, and it was like [having] a cheerleader, someone who's going to give you some good vibes for the day.",
      "\"I've got this encouraging external voice going \u2013 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially.\"",
      "For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online \"chatbots\" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages.",
      "At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown.",
      "She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day.",
      "\"I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it.",
      "\"The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle.\"",
      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, in a U-turn following mounting political pressure in recent weeks.",
      "More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments, worth up to \u00a3300, when the pension top-up became means-tested last year.",
      "Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said ministers would change the threshold to allow \"more pensioners\" to qualify again.",
      "But it remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement for the payments, or when the changes will take effect.",
      "Sir Keir said the policy would be changed at the autumm Budget, adding ministers would only \"make decisions we can afford\".",
      "Starmer's winter fuel U-turn seeks to calm Labour nerves",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump sum of \u00a3200 a year for households with a pensioner under 80, or \u00a3300 for households with a pensioner over 80.",
      "It was previously paid in November or December to all pensioners, but 10.3 million lost out last year after the government restricted eligibility to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, to save an estimated \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move, announced shortly after Labour took office last July, led to fierce criticism from unions and pensioner charities.",
      "But pressure to change course has grown in recent weeks, with some Labour MPs and councillors blaming the policy for the party's losses at last month's local elections in parts of England.",
      "Grumbling from MPs generally on the Labour left spread into the party more widely, and even MPs who defended the policy said it was the most frequently raised issue by members of the public.",
      "Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, who introduced winter fuel as a universal benefit when chancellor, said Sir Keir was \"right\" to reconsider.",
      "Speaking to the BBC he said: \"No pensioner should be forced into poverty, if they have served the country all their lives, if they can not afford heating because they don't have the funds to do so.",
      "\"I think what Keir is saying is we will be fair to pensioners.\"",
      "'Longest U-turn'",
      "It had been thought a change in approach could be confirmed at next month's spending review, when the government will set out departments' budgets for the coming years.",
      "But in a surprise move, Sir Keir confirmed the policy U-turn in response to a Labour backbencher's at Prime Minister's Questions.",
      "Tory leader Kemi Badenoch did not respond immediately to the announcement, waiting until the fourth of her six allotted questions to mention it.",
      "She later denied she had been wrong-footed, telling reporters she \"had to talk\" about rising inflation figures first, and the order of her questions was \"not what people out there care about\".",
      "She welcomed the \"inevitable\" U-turn, but called on the government to set out \"early\" details of their new approach, adding that autumn's Budget would be too late to deliver changes this winter.",
      "She did not specify where she wanted the new threshold to be set, but added she did not think that \"millionaires\" should qualify again.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the \"longest U-turn\" from the government, and called for the cuts to be reversed \"in full\".",
      "Eligibility questions",
      "The income threshold for pension credit, the main benefit to qualify to continue to receive winter fuel payments, is currently \u00a311,800 a year for individuals and \u00a318,023 for pensioner couples.",
      "Designing a new income threshold will now present political and practical headaches for ministers ahead of the Budget in the autumn.",
      "Possible options suggested by commentators and policy experts include linking it to lower council tax bands, or expanding eligibility to those receiving housing or disability benefits.",
      "Resolution Foundation, a think tank, said there were \"huge doubts\" over creating a new dedicated means test to qualify for the top-up.",
      "It added the most straightforward option would be to expand eligibility for pension credit - but cautioned that expanding this by 10% would cost \u00a32.5bn due to knock-on costs, more than the original policy was meant to save.",
      "Age UK, one of the charities opposing the cuts, welcomed the change in approach but said any new system should ensure pensioners on \"low and modest incomes\" would be able to keep the payments.",
      "Asked by reporters when the changes would take effect, the prime minister's spokesman declined to guarantee it would be in place this coming winter, but added: \"We obviously want to deliver this as quickly as possible.",
      "\"We will only make decisions when we can say where the money is coming from, how we're going to pay for it and that it's affordable,\" he added.",
      "Triple lock",
      "Winter fuel payments, introduced in 1997, were billed as a way to guarantee pensioners would be able to heat their homes during colder months.",
      "From 2010 onwards, the main state pension gained additional protection under the \"triple lock\" policy - under which pensions go up each year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "This year state pensions went up by 4.1% - a rise of \u00a3363 a year for those on the basic pension or \u00a3472 for those on the new pension.",
      "Winter fuel payments are devolved, with the UK government responsible for payments in England and Wales.",
      "The Northern Ireland Executive also scaled back payments last winter following Labour's cuts, but kept a \u00a3100 top-up for all pensioners.",
      "The Scottish government also means-tested payments last year, but was planning to introduce a universal \u00a3100 payment next winter for those who no longer qualified for the main payment.",

      "The details will follow in the Budget this autumn. But make no mistake, this is a U-turn.",
      "The decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance was one of the first announcements made by Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves almost a year ago.",

      "It was widely blamed for a bad set of local election results and the dismal defeat to Reform at the Runcorn and Helsby by-election on the same day.",
      "Now the prime minister has announced that the government would look again at the threshold to allow \"more pensioners\" to qualify for the payment.",
      "There is an interesting debate even among those MPs who were clamouring for a U-turn of this sort about whether the policy was always destined to be a failure.",
      "Some believe that it was intrinsically inept to target a benefit paid to pensioners. Others believe the threshold should have been set higher so that fewer pensioners lost out. Another group say that if the Budget - with a big tax rise and funding boost for public services - had come at the same time, it would have made the winter fuel policy less isolated and as a result less controversial.",
      "And yet another group believe that the government's failure lay in neglecting to make a positive case for the policy.",
      "Instead of sorrowfully saying they had been forced into the means-testing by Conservative misrule, this argument goes, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves should have argued that there were many pensioners who simply did not need the money.",
      "All that is of academic interest now. A consensus had formed across the Labour Party that the policy was a colossal political misstep and from that point on the logic facing this prime minister - who is utterly unsentimental about moving on from old policy positions - was remorseless.",
      "Why now though?",
      "One reason may be that rumours had reached overdrive that an announcement was in the offing. Given that ministers' conspicuous non-denials were becoming non-stop, there may have been a calculation that it made more sense just to acknowledge the inevitable now.",
      "But it is also worth considering the broader context. Winter fuel was by no means the only contentious element of this government's economic policy.",
      "There is a rebellion brewing on the government's welfare cuts. Those are likely to face a vote in the Commons next month although estimates of how big the rebellion might be vary wildly.",
      "The government is in no mood to concede on that issue - as demonstrated by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall's speech this morning. Apart from anything else, they cannot afford to - at least without choosing to change their main tax plans or their borrowing rules. The welfare reforms raise far more money than the means-testing of winter fuel was meant to.",
      "But Sir Keir and his party whips will now be able to reassure anxious Labour MPs that they do listen to their complaints, even if they cannot address them in every area.",
      "Fundamentally this is embarrassing for Reeves. She made a big, bold and early call and has reversed it within 10 months.",
      "Her economic and political judgment is increasingly widely questioned within her own party  - as demonstrated, just as one example, by the memo from Angela Rayner's department splashed across the front page of the Telegraph this morning.",
      "The most important verdict on this reversal, though, will come from the public.",
      "Is it a sign of strength from a pragmatic government willing to listen to criticism and act fast in response? Or a sign of weakness from an ideologically unmoored government which does not know what it believes?",

    "story": [
      "The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza \"morally unjustifiable\".",
      "The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation over the weekend.",
      "There were fiery exchanges in Parliament with Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who suggested the actions would be welcomed by Hamas, but also angry calls for the government to go further.",
      "In response, Israel's foreign spokesman said external pressure would \"not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence\".",
      "Paul Adams: Starmer and Lammy sound genuinely angry at Israel",
      "Global experts have warned of a looming famine because the Israeli government has blockaded supplies of food, fuel and medicine to Gaza for the last 11 weeks.",
      "Officials say the sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis after two months of blockade played a part in the latest announcements, as did growing pressure from MPs and the public.",
      "Ministers were also responding to the lack of any clear path towards a ceasefire and a sense of frustration from the White House, with President Donald Trump sidestepping the country on his Middle East tour last week and Vice-President JD Vance postponing a trip there this week.",
      "The Israeli government has already been warned it must end its \"egregious\" military expansion and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\" in a joint statement from the leaders of the UK, Canada and France on Monday.",
      "Israel said it had allowed five lorries carrying humanitarian aid into the territory but  the UN's humanitarian chief said this was a \"drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed\".",
      "Later on Tuesday, the UN confirmed that, although permission had now been given to send about 100 aid trucks into Gaza, no aid had yet been distributed.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the current situation \"intolerable\", saying \"humanitarian aid needs to get in at pace\".",
      "In the House of Commons, there were shouts of \"shame\" from MPs as Lammy set out how an Israeli minister had said their latest operations would be \"cleansing Gaza\", \"destroying what's left\" and relocating Palestinians \"to third countries\".",
      "\"We must call this what it is,\" he told MPs. \"It is extremism, it is dangerous, it is repellent, it is monstrous, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"",
      "Lammy said Israel had suffered \"a heinous attack\" on 7 October 2023 and the UK had always backed the country's right to defend itself.",
      "However, the foreign secretary said the Israeli government had set out on a \"morally unjustifiable\" and \"utterly counterproductive\" path that would not bring hostages safely home.",
      "Instead, he accused the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu of \"isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world\", as he announced negotiations on a free trade deal had been suspended.",
      "The Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, told Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely that the UK would not \"stand by\" as Israel increased military operations in Gaza.",
      "\"Today I summoned Israel's ambassador to the FCDO,\" Falconer said in a post on X.",

      "\"The UK will not stand by as this happens,\" he added.",
      "Condemning settler violence, Lammy also set out sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, against three individuals and four companies who were \"carrying out heinous abuses of human rights\".",
      "Dame Priti said: \"Strong words will do little to resolve the real challenges that are taking place and the suffering we are seeing taking place day in, day out.\"",

      "Abtisam Mohamed, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said Netanyahu had made an \"explicit admission that Israeli officials intend to carry out ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Lammy said the suspension of some arms sales to Israel had ensured \"none of us are complicit in any acts that breach international humanitarian law\" but he had announced further measures because the war was still continuing.",
      "Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, said the \"weaponisation of food\" was \"morally reprehensible\" and called for an arms embargo to be imposed, as well as sanctions on Israeli officials.",
      "Lammy gave an \"absolute commitment\" that the UK government would take further action \"if needed over the coming days and weeks\".",
      "He also responded to calls to officially recognise the state of Palestine by confirming he was \"in close dialogue\" with both France and Saudi Arabia about recognition.",
      "Diplomats told the BBC they would still prefer to use recognition of Palestine as a spur to further action, perhaps as part of a wider peace settlement, rather than a symbolic expression of anger against Israel and support for Palestinians.",

      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.",
      "Up until the ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists.",

      "A leaked advice paper to Labour's governing body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), recommended delaying the conference because the \"only legally defensible alternative\" would be to restrict attendance to biological women.",
      "The paper set out how \"there is a significant risk of legal challenge to the event as it currently operates\" and \"there may be protests, direct action and heightened security risks\" if it goes ahead on 27 September.",
      "That could carry a \"political risk\" of overshadowing the party's showcase autumn conference which begins the following day on 28 September.",
      "On Tuesday night, the party's NEC voted to delay the conference, pending a wider review of positive action measures.",
      "The NEC also decided to postpone the elections to the National Labour Women's Committee, which are normally held at the conference, and to extend the terms of those currently serving.",
      "Labour moved away from using all-women shortlists at the last general election. The leaked paper also advised the party to issue guidance to make clear that all-women shortlists can only apply to \"applicants who were biologically female at birth\".",

      "It said in a statement the Environment Agency was looking at dozens of alleged offences which included releasing excessive pollution and not carrying out adequate water quality monitoring.",
      "The government said the regulator had launched 81 criminal probes since last July's election after hiring 400 more staff for the purpose and that it had initiated proceedings against seven companies.",
      "Water UK, which represents water companies, said in a statement that firms should be investigated and held to account when necessary.",
      "The announcement comes amid public anger over pollution in rivers and seas. The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a 10-year high, according to data released by campaigners last month.",
      "The increase in Environment Agency inspectors is partly due to a recruitment drive from the previous Conservative government.",
      "In February 2024 the Conservatives said they planned to quadruple water inspections and hire an additional 500 staff for inspections and enforcement.",
      "None of the 81 investigations have so far led to convictions, which often take years to work their way through the court systems. But the government said they could lead to water companies being fined hundreds of millions of pounds.",
      "\"This Labour Government is cleaning up the foul mess the Tories left behind with a record number of criminal investigations into law-breaking water companies - which could see bosses behind bars,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "The Conservative Party defended its record in response, with a spokesman saying that while it was in government it had begun the process of reforming water and sewage systems and taken action to ban bonuses for bosses of water companies that committed criminal breaches.",
      "\"The Labour Government made big promises on water, and we will continue to hold them to account to ensure they continue the work of the previous Conservative Government to improve our water and sewage systems for billpayers,\" the spokesman said.",
      "\"It's good to see the Government finally taking water pollution seriously,\" said CEO of campaigners River Action, James Wallace.",
      "But he pointed out that water bosses could only serve jail time for obstructing investigations, not for pollution itself.",
      "\"Jail time for water bosses remains highly unlikely,\" he said. \"The law only applies to cover-ups \u2014 and there's no need to hide what's already happening in plain sight, week in, week out.\"",

      "Greenpeace UK head of politics Ami McCarthy said: \"Water firms have got away with flouting rules and pumping sewage into our rivers for far too long, so it's good to see ministers finally throwing the book at these serial polluters.\"",
      "They also urged the government to ensure that consumers did not foot the bill of any fines issued to water companies.",
      "\"It is right that water companies are investigated and held to account when things go wrong,\" Water UK said in a statement.",

      "There are doubts over whether UK passport holders will be able to use e-gates at EU airports this summer.",
      "The EU Commission has told the BBC that UK citizens will not have access to them until a new scheme to enhance border security comes into force in October, and even then it is up to individual countries.",
      "When asked if e-gates would be available this summer, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC: \"Nothing is going to happen before that's [the new scheme] in place.\"",

      "\"After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment,\" McFadden added.",
      "Monday's deal between the UK and the EU says there will be \"no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)\".",
      "The prime minister's official spokesperson said that the UK would \"be working with member states to roll that out as quickly as possible\", adding that \"talks have started with individual EU nations\".",
      "An EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES would open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders.",
      "\"Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system.\"",
      "Some EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer.",
      "Speaking about the agreement on Tuesday with supermarket workers, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They were excited about the e-gates and being able to go on their holidays, which they have obviously already planned, and not be in the horrendously long queues. \"",
      "Surprise inclusion",
      "The inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October.",
      "Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said:",
      "\"This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch.\"",
      "Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp.",
      "The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp.",
      "The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station."

      "A family who went to court to protect a young girl from her paedophile father have criticised government legislation intended to help others in a similar position.",
      "The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment which would remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles - but only if they have abused their own children.",
      "In 2023 the BBC reported on a mother who had to spend more than \u00a330,000 to protect her small daughter. Her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, but kept parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "Her parents said they were \"very disappointed\". The government said it was \"the beginning of legal change in this area and not the end\".",
      "Over many months in Cardiff Family Court I watched as a young woman, who we called \"Bethan\", brought a case to protect her young daughter.",
      "Although her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, and was banned from contact with other children, he retained parental responsibility over his own child.",
      "That meant that he could have a say over her education, decisions about her health, and where she would live.",
      "He could also in future have contact with his daughter. In fact, he told the court from prison via a videolink, he was already writing letters every week to the little girl. He wasn't allowed to send them.",
      "At the end of the hearings, the judge granted the mother's application, removing the father's parental rights and barring him from all contact, including on social media, until the child turns 18.",
      "The family were pleased - but it had cost them over \u00a330,000 in legal fees.",
      "Harriet Harman, who is now in the Lords but was then an MP, heard my report, and decided to try to change the law, to remove what she called this \"glaring anomaly\".",
      "Her amendment meant that after a criminal conviction for serious child sex offences, a parent would automatically lose their parental responsibility.",
      "Families like Bethan's would no longer need to go to the Family Court.",
      "In April 2024 the Conservative Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk supported this change for the most serious cases, where children had been raped.",
      "\"This new law will ensure they are automatically safeguarded against those whose despicable actions have shown them to utterly lack any nurturing and caring instincts,\" he said at the time.",
      "Bethan and her parents were delighted.",
      "But the government called the July election - and the law didn't change.",
      "In the most recent King's Speech, in 2024, the Labour government promised to enact the change, saying it would restrict parental responsibility for child sex offenders.",
      "However, when the wording of the new law was published on 7 May it said that removing parental responsibility would only apply \"for a serious sexual offence committed against a child for whom the offender has parental responsibility\".",
      "In other words, where someone had abused their own child or stepchild.",
      "This would not cover Bethan's family.",
      "Bethan's parents said the government should go back to the bill that Harriet Harman had proposed, where the emphasis was on \"protecting innocent children\" rather than \"thinking about the rights of the paedophile\".",
      "The draft legislation - which had its second reading in Parliament today - also says the restriction of parental responsibility should apply only where someone has been sentenced to at least four years in prison.",
      "The grandparents of Bethan's child believe it should apply more widely.",
      "\"Really what we're talking about here is where the line is drawn. And we obviously think that line should be drawn much lower down,\" the child's grandfather said.",
      "The grandmother said the court case had been a \"terrible stress\" for her daughter.",
      "\"What people don't realise is when you take on a family court case, it's like taking on a full time job because it takes hundreds of hours to get the information together,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Bethan had to take her child out of childcare, give up her flat, and \"use every bit of savings\" she had to pay for the family court, the child's grandmother added.",
      "Victims minister Alex Davies-Jones said in response: \"We are protecting children and ensuring victims are properly supported.",
      "\"These changes will, for the first time, introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility for offenders who sexually abuse their own child and receive a prison sentence of four years or more - removing the need for victims to go through court to secure this.",
      "\"I do recognise the concerns raised by victims and campaigners and will continue working closely with them to ensure the law is as strong and protective as it needs to be.\"",

      "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I understand the calls on us to be as ambitious as possible, and to expand this to a wider cohort of offenders, but we believe our measure is stronger than what came before and it is the right starting point for change.",

      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",
      "\"They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output.",
      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",
      "Sir Elton John angry at 'criminal' AI plans for artists",
      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",
      "\"I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else.\"",
      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "It's worth remembering too that the 2016 referendum was not the only political mandate delivered on this issue, and that Labour's general election manifesto last year promised an \"improvement\" to the Brexit deal.",
      "The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit \u2013 membership of the single market and customs union \u2013 but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense.",
      "Of course pragmatism lies in the eyes of the beholder. The Conservatives have lambasted the deal as \"surrender\", attacking both the 12-year extension to existing fishing quotas and the commitment for the UK to follow EU rules on agriculture.",
      "Reform UK, in many ways the successor to the Brexit Party and UKIP, are unsurprisingly making a similar argument.",
      "On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed \"some positive first steps\" but urged the prime minister to \"be more ambitious\".",
      "Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods.",

      "If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU.",
      "If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life.",

      "The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals.",
      "But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
      "Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks.",
      "The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)",
      "For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety.",
      "Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019.",
      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on. Although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in prices, that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",
      "But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",

      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a \"win-win\" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry.",
      "The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of \"capitulation\" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will \"slash red tape\", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs.",
      "The UK government is trying to offset the disappointment of some in the fishing industry with a \u00a3360m fund for coastal communities.",
      "There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome.",
      "However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU.",
      "They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy.",
      "An earlier \"reset\" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together.",

      "\"I think it's likely some people from Patriotic Alternative will try to do this at a local level and their dream would be to turn some branches,\" he said. \"Judging by the current standards of Reform's vetting I think there's a strong chance they wouldn't be picked up.\"",

      "Prof Phinnimore said: \"If that trend is to be reversed, a closer UK-EU relationship needs to deliver on reducing obstacles to the GB-NI movement of goods.\"",

      "It was agreed that the most practical way to keep the border open between NI and the Republic of Ireland was for NI to follow many EU laws on the regulation of goods.",

      "How could an agri-food deal change things?",
      "Agri-food deals from the EU fall into two broad categories: New Zealand-style or Swiss-style.",
      "The EU's deal with New Zealand means that each party recognises that the other has high food standards and so the frequency of checks on products and paperwork is reduced.",
      "However, New Zealand still sets its own standards and a proportion of goods are still checked as they enter the EU.",
      "By contrast there are no regulatory border controls for trade in agri-food products between Switzerland and the EU.",
      "But the Swiss only have this deal because they agreed to follow EU rules almost to the letter, without much say in setting those rules.",
      "Switzerland is obliged to modify its laws in response to changes in EU legislation, what is known as dynamic alignment, and accept oversight from the European Court of Justice.",
      "A Swiss-style deal would mean controls on GB food products entering NI could be effectively ended.",
      "The EU has previously said this deal would be on offer to the UK but the government had retained an ambivalent stance on whether it would accept this.",
      "However in recent weeks ministers have been careful not to rule it out.",
      "Such a deal will face opposition from Brexit supporters who say it would involve surrendering powers which were returned to the UK after it left the EU.",

      "The Irish Sea is really two borders.",
      "One deals with products' standards - making sure goods can be legally sold. The other deals with customs - making sure the correct tariffs have been paid.",
      "An agri-food deal would go a long way to removing the standards border but it would leave the customs border untouched.",

    "story": [
      "\"We're turning a page,\" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday after the bloc's first summit with the UK since Brexit. \"We're opening a new chapter.\"",
      "It is not the first page that has been turned in the post-Brexit period, but it is potentially the most significant.",
      "The two sides have now struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas that are still up for negotiation.",
      "For Brussels, this negotiation was a chance to bring Britain \u2013 a major defence power \u2013 closer in a time of geopolitical turbulence.",
      "And to address what some member states see as irritating hangovers from Brexit.",
      "For years, there was a \"don't touch it\" mentality when it came to taking a broad look at the Brexit settlement, according to one EU diplomat.",
      "It all involved \"too much politics\" with fears it could all \"go wrong.\"",
      "Remember, up until the 2023 Windsor Framework agreement, London and Brussels were bogged down in a protracted dispute over trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.",
      "Then, in 2024, a new government won power in the UK - the more EU-friendly Labour Party.",
      "Officials in Brussels had long voiced exasperation \u2013 even distrust \u2013 with prior Conservative administrations, a party with a vocal Brexit-backing contingent.",

      "Diplomats in Brussels, however, insist that this is a \"normalisation\" of relations between neighbours who still look at the world in a broadly similar way.",
      "That being said, there was evident satisfaction in EU circles about locking in fishing quotas for 12 years.",
      "When I checked with one diplomat about that detail, they initially replied with a smiley face emoji.",
      "Another said: \"The deal is balanced\u2014arguably with favourable terms for the EU\u2014and simply shows that splendid isolation is not an option in today's climate.\"",
      "Of course, the EU will want to highlight its \"wins\" in a negotiation with a former member state who badly shook the bloc by leaving.",
      "Nevertheless, coastal countries - notably France \u2013 will be happy at not having to endure annual fish quota talks, for now.",
      "It was, in the end I'm told, quid pro quo. The EU got its fishing deal. In return, it'll be easier for UK businesses to export agri-food products \u2013 although that element hasn't been finalised.",
      "Also yet to be ironed out are the plans for youth mobility \u2013 which would allow young people to study or work more easily between Britain and the EU.",
      "That was a particularly important goal for countries like Germany, anxious to win better access to an English-speaking country with prestigious universities.",
      "Another key point for Berlin was the new defence and security partnership.",
      "Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's unpredictable White House have ripped up the rules on European security.",
      "Time has been something of a healer \u2013 but the events of recent years have also created a sense of urgency.",
      "Better ties with Britain, which remains a major defence player, is a no-brainer \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 for mainland Europe as it tries to scale up investment and capabilities.",
      "Nations like Germany \u2013 which only recently hit the 2% Nato spending target \u2013 are acutely aware that they have been left exposed by the dramatic global developments of recent years.",
      "But, of course, most of this deal is an agreement in principle; a statement of intent on issues also ranging across cyber security, energy and migration.",
      "\"I think it's a good step,\" another EU diplomat told me. \"It's good to test the waters for practical cooperation and what can be done. Let's take it from there.\"",
      "There is still a watchful wariness in Brussels about Britain's fraught and divisive debate about relations with the EU.",
      "All the specifics, which have yet to be negotiated, could stir up further political storms whether that's on political compromises or cost.",
      "This \"reset\" may not change the big fundamentals of Brexit - the UK remains out of the single market and customs union- but it does commit London and Brussels to doing a lot more talking as they try to fill the many gaps that lie within this long list of ambitions.",
      "That means there will be a greater volume of diplomatic traffic between the UK and the EU going forward.",

      "The scientific study took place in the summer of 2023, when temperatures shot up in the oceans, leading to large swathes of coral turning white.",
      "The scientists took multiple measurements of individual clownfish coping with the heat.",
      "They found the tiny fish didn't just lose weight but got shorter by several millimetres. And it wasn't a one-off - 75% of fish shrunk at least once during the heatwave.",
      "Dr Rueger explained: \"It's not just them going on a diet and losing lots of weight, but they're actively changing their size and making themselves into a smaller individual that needs less food and is more efficient with oxygen.\"",
      "The fish may be absorbing fat and bone, as has been seen in other animals, such as  marine iguanas, although this needs to be confirmed through laboratory studies.",

    "story": [
      "The world's tropical forests, which provide a crucial buffer against climate change, disappeared faster than ever recorded last year, new satellite analysis suggests.",
      "Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km (26,000 sq mi) of these pristine, old-growth forests were lost in 2024 \u2013 an area nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland, or 18 football pitches a minute.",
      "Fires were the main cause, overtaking land clearances from agriculture for the first time on record, with the Amazon faring particularly badly amid record drought.",
      "There was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss.",
      "Tropical rainforests store hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon in soils and woody trunks. But this new global record raises further questions about their resilience on a warming planet.",
      "Many researchers are concerned some forests, such as parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a \"tipping point\", beyond which they could fall into irreversible decline.",
      "\"The tipping point idea is, I think, increasingly the right one,\" said Prof Matthew Hansen, co-director of GLAD laboratory at the University of Maryland, which produces the data.",
      "Prof Hansen described the new results as \"frightening\", and warned of the possible \"savannisation\" of the rainforest, where old-growth tropical forests die back and permanently switch to savanna.",
      "\"It's still a theory, but I think that that's more and more plausible looking at the data.\"",
      "A separate study, published last week, made a similar warning of possible significant dieback of the Amazon if global warming exceeds the international target of 1.5C.",
      "This would not only threaten the vibrant array of wildlife living in these most biodiverse habitats, but would also have serious ramifications for the global climate.",
      "Until recently, the Amazon had been doing humanity a favour, absorbing more planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) than it released.",
      "But the burning of these forests emits huge amounts of CO2 \u2013 adding to warming rather than limiting it.",
      "In 2023-24, the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, fuelled by climate change and the natural warming El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Many fires are started deliberately to clear land for agriculture, making it difficult to disentangle the two.",
      "But the drought provided ideal conditions for fires to spread out of control, with Brazil and Bolivia most badly affected.",
      "While only a single year, it fits the expected pattern of more intense tropical fires in a warming world.",
      "\"I think we are in a new phase, where it's not just the clearing for agriculture that's the main driver,\" said Rod Taylor of the World Resources Institute (WRI), which is also behind the latest report.",
      "\"Now we have this new amplifying effect, which is a real climate change feedback loop, where fires are just much more intense and much more ferocious than they've ever been.\"",
      "In total, the record loss of the world's old-growth (primary) tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, the researchers estimate.",
      "That's roughly the same as the emissions of the European Union.",
      "Signs of progress",
      "Countries in South East Asia, however, bucked the global trend.",
      "The area of primary forest loss in Indonesia fell by 11% compared to 2023, for example, despite drought conditions.",
      "This was the result of a concerted effort by governments and communities working together to enforce \"no burning\" laws, according to Elizabeth Goldman, co-director of the Global Forest Watch project at WRI.",
      "\"Indonesia serves as a bright spot in the 2024 data,\" she said.",
      "\"Political will is a key factor of success - it's impossible otherwise,\" agreed Gabriel Labbate, head of climate change mitigation at the United Nations forests programme UNREDD, which was not involved in today's report.",
      "Other countries, including Brazil, have seen success in the past with similar approaches, but started to see losses increase again in 2014 following a change in government policies.",
      "Prof Hansen said that although the progress in South East Asia was positive, the fluctuations in forest loss in Brazil show that protection policies have to be consistent.",
      "\"The key we haven't seen yet is sustained success in reducing and maintaining low levels of conversion of these ecosystems and if you were interested in conserving the environment you have to win always and forever,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The researchers agree that this year's UN climate summit COP30 - which is being hosted in the Amazon - will be critical for sharing and promoting forest protection schemes.",
      "One proposal is to reward countries which maintain tropical forests through payments. The detail is still to be worked out but has promise, according to Rod Taylor.",

    "story": [
      "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist?",
      "They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists \u2013 who are several years ahead.",
      "The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.",
      "The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).",
      "The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.",
      "The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\".",
      "Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.",
      "\"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says.",
      "When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter \u2013 from which stars, planets and everything around us are made \u2013 and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.",
      "Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we \u2013 as matter \u2013 are.",
      "Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won \u2013\u00a0and we exist \u2013 lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.",
      "They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.",
      "This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.",
      "The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.",
      "Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.",
      "\"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said.",
      "Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K.",
      "The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.",
      "\"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says.",
      "Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\"",
      "But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.",
      "\"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.\"",
      "The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery \u2013 for now.",

      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",
      "\"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\"",
      "Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki.",
      "He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\".",
      "He and his team raised 10.6m yen (\u00a355,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world.",
      "One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\"",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development.",
      "The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament.",
      "The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss.",
      "\"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki.",

    "story": [
      "The world's tropical forests, which provide a crucial buffer against climate change, disappeared faster than ever recorded last year, new satellite analysis suggests.",
      "Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km (26,000 sq mi) of these pristine, old-growth forests were lost in 2024 \u2013 an area nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland, or 18 football pitches a minute.",
      "Fires were the main cause, overtaking land clearances from agriculture for the first time on record, with the Amazon faring particularly badly amid record drought.",
      "There was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss.",
      "Tropical rainforests store hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon in soils and woody trunks. But this new global record raises further questions about their resilience on a warming planet.",
      "Many researchers are concerned some forests, such as parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a \"tipping point\", beyond which they could fall into irreversible decline.",
      "\"The tipping point idea is, I think, increasingly the right one,\" said Prof Matthew Hansen, co-director of GLAD laboratory at the University of Maryland, which produces the data.",
      "Prof Hansen described the new results as \"frightening\", and warned of the possible \"savannisation\" of the rainforest, where old-growth tropical forests die back and permanently switch to savanna.",
      "\"It's still a theory, but I think that that's more and more plausible looking at the data.\"",
      "A separate study, published last week, made a similar warning of possible significant dieback of the Amazon if global warming exceeds the international target of 1.5C.",
      "This would not only threaten the vibrant array of wildlife living in these most biodiverse habitats, but would also have serious ramifications for the global climate.",
      "Until recently, the Amazon had been doing humanity a favour, absorbing more planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) than it released.",
      "But the burning of these forests emits huge amounts of CO2 \u2013 adding to warming rather than limiting it.",
      "In 2023-24, the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, fuelled by climate change and the natural warming El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Many fires are started deliberately to clear land for agriculture, making it difficult to disentangle the two.",
      "But the drought provided ideal conditions for fires to spread out of control, with Brazil and Bolivia most badly affected.",
      "While only a single year, it fits the expected pattern of more intense tropical fires in a warming world.",
      "\"I think we are in a new phase, where it's not just the clearing for agriculture that's the main driver,\" said Rod Taylor of the World Resources Institute (WRI), which is also behind the latest report.",
      "\"Now we have this new amplifying effect, which is a real climate change feedback loop, where fires are just much more intense and much more ferocious than they've ever been.\"",
      "In total, the record loss of the world's old-growth (primary) tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, the researchers estimate.",
      "That's roughly the same as the emissions of the European Union.",

      "Countries in South East Asia, however, bucked the global trend.",
      "The area of primary forest loss in Indonesia fell by 11% compared to 2023, for example, despite drought conditions.",
      "This was the result of a concerted effort by governments and communities working together to enforce \"no burning\" laws, according to Elizabeth Goldman, co-director of the Global Forest Watch project at WRI.",
      "\"Indonesia serves as a bright spot in the 2024 data,\" she said.",
      "\"Political will is a key factor of success - it's impossible otherwise,\" agreed Gabriel Labbate, head of climate change mitigation at the United Nations forests programme UNREDD, which was not involved in today's report.",
      "Other countries, including Brazil, have seen success in the past with similar approaches, but started to see losses increase again in 2014 following a change in government policies.",
      "Prof Hansen said that although the progress in South East Asia was positive, the fluctuations in forest loss in Brazil show that protection policies have to be consistent.",
      "\"The key we haven't seen yet is sustained success in reducing and maintaining low levels of conversion of these ecosystems and if you were interested in conserving the environment you have to win always and forever,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The researchers agree that this year's UN climate summit COP30 - which is being hosted in the Amazon - will be critical for sharing and promoting forest protection schemes.",
      "One proposal is to reward countries which maintain tropical forests through payments. The detail is still to be worked out but has promise, according to Rod Taylor.",

      "The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several metres or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned.",
      "Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered \"safe\" for coastal populations.",
      "They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past.",
      "But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks.",
      "The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities.",
      "But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say.",
      "\"Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,\" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University.",
      "The 2015 Paris climate agreement saw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises \"well below\" 2C - and ideally 1.5C.",
      "That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is \"safe\", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years.",
      "The authors of the new paper, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case.",
      "First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting \u2013 with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago.",
      "And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher.",
      "Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year.",
      "\"Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,\" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre.",
      "East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable.",
      "\"We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,\" added Prof Stokes.",
      "Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good.",
      "\"Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,\" said Prof Stokes.",
      "The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond \"tipping points\" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit.",
      "\"The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication.",
      "\"This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,\" he added.",
      "An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines.",
      "Defining a \"safe\" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others.",
      "But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say.",
      "\"If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],\" argued Prof Bamber.",
      "However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say.",
      "\"The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,\" said Prof Stokes.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.",
      "Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be \"shut down\" without government help over energy pricing.",
      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",
      "Pay row",
      "Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the \u00a34.5m pay he received the previous year was \"impossible to justify\".",
      "And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans.",
      "When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: \"I don't set my own pay.",
      "\"I think it's really difficult,\" he said. \"I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done.\""

      "Another method used is called spearphishing, where fake emails are targeted at specific people who have access to systems.",
      "They are presented with a fake page where they enter their login details, or encouraged to click a link which then installs malicious software.",
      "\"The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes,\" the report said.",
      "A vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook was also exploited to collect credentials \"via specially crafted Outlook calendar appointment invitations\".",

      "The change, unveiled at the company's annual developers conference in Mountain View, California, is part of the tech giant's push to remain competitive against ChatGPT and other AI services, which threaten to erode Google's dominance of online search.",

      "Leo Gebbie, principal analyst and director for the Americas at CCS Insight, said Google had been expected to wrap AI more tightly into its products.",
      "He said he thought the chatbot would help minimise the number of web pages that users must sift through, while also allowing people to ask more complicated queries.",
      "\"For the end user, this should mean less time spent browsing the web itself, and more time spent talking with Google's AI tools,\" he said.",
      "Any updates that Google makes to search are \"of critical importance,\" added Gebbie, since the search business contributes the vast majority of Google's revenues.",

      "\"I've got this encouraging external voice going \u2013 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially.\"",
      "For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online \"chatbots\" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages.",
      "At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown.",
      "She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day.",
      "\"I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it.",
      "\"The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle.\"",
      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",

    "story": [
      "Uber has said it is \"ready to go\" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles.",
      "The previous administration said fully autonomous cars were \"set to be on roads by 2026\", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027.",
      "While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.",
      "With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.",
      "\"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.",
      "The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve.",
      "It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US.",
      "They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore.",
      "But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed.",
      "\"We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027\", the Department for Transport said in a statement.",
      "\"We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,\" it added.",
      "'Hands-off' experience",
      "In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week.",
      "Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.",
      "The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.",
      "That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.",
      "A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver.",
      "But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon \"becomes the new normal\".",
      "That was certainly my experience during our ride.",
      "I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software.",
      "It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses.",
      "The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes.",
      "George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed.",
      "If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am \u2013 and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty.",
      "Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated.",
      "But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data.",
      "But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in.",
      "In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how his robotaxi drove round in circles in an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help.",
      "General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns.",
      "\"The reality is that one accident is too many,\" said Uber's Mr Macdonald.",
      "\"That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers\u2026 we operate in the real world and stuff happens.\"",
      "In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out.",
      "Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be \"safety-led\" in the UK.",
      "\"Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it \u2013 insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur.\"",
      "The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential \"to build an industry worth \u00a342bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035.\"",
      "But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving.",
      "Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the \"significant social implications\" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered.",
      "Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future.",
      "\"I've got young kids,\" he said.",

      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",

He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",

      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",

      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try to limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "But the former head of the National Cyber Safety Centre (NCSC), Ciaran Martin, said his \"biggest cyber-security worry\" was the threat of simultaneous attacks on public services, like councils and hospitals, which had the potential to \"wreck lives\".",
      "The BBC has been investigating how the attack on Redcar and Cleveland unfolded, what it took to get things back to normal and the impact on local people.",
      "In the days before Saturday 8 February 2020, an email with a seemingly innocuous attachment arrived in a council inbox. Hidden inside was a piece of malicious software that would lie dormant in the council's network until it was activated remotely.",
      "Within a few hours of that activation it had spread throughout the computer system, locking staff out and scrambling files.",
      "By 11:00 GMT on Saturday, local residents began to notice the council website was offline.",
      "\"There wasn't a lot we could do,\" Mrs Lanigan said about efforts to stop the virus.",
      "\"You had to be practical, so it was actually getting more phones in there so that people could ring us.\"",
      "News was spreading, but Mrs Lanigan, who lost her position in the 2023 local elections, claims she received pressure from council officials and central government not to speak out.",
      "The council declined to be interviewed about the attack but said there had been no pressure or instruction not to speak publicly, either at the time or since.",
      "What Mrs Lanigan did not say in 2020, but admits now, was the council was dealing with a crisis.",
      "\"It was devastating,\" she said. \"Devastating for us, for the staff, for the public and for everybody else.\"",
      "They had lost the ability to share information with police and the NHS, while social services and elderly care services were knocked out, she said.",
      "\"Even somebody ringing up and saying 'my bin hasn't been emptied' wasn't dealt with.\"",

      "By the morning of Monday 10 February IT staff were desperately going from desk to desk, placing infected computers in a growing pile.",
      "\"When we saw how much damage had been caused we realised it would probably take weeks, maybe years to do,\" said IT worker Ben Saunders.",
      "At the same time, experts at the NCSC - part of GCHQ - were considering the council's plea for help.",
      "Mr Martin, who was the NCSC's chief executive at the time, said it was \"unusually serious\".",
      "\"If a council are telling you they are worried about their ability to run services for vulnerable children, you take that very seriously.\"",
      "It was feared social workers, tasked with keeping young people safe, would struggle to do their jobs without access to the online records they relied on to help inform difficult decisions.",
      "In what Mr Martin called an \"unusual\" step, NCSC officers were deployed to Redcar.",
      "On Tuesday 11 February \u2013 the second working day after the attack - hackers made their ransom demand.",
      "The exact figure has never been made public, but Mr Martin said that, based on similar attacks, it was likely to have been in the \"low single figure millions of US dollars\".",
      "The current government is considering a ban on the public sector paying ransoms to hackers but, while it is the guidance, there was no formal ban in place in 2020.",
      "Regardless, Mrs Lanigan was in no mind to cough up. \"I'm a Yorkshire woman and the thing being about that is there was no way I was paying any ransom to anybody.\"",
      "The following day, Wednesday 12 February, the government held a Cobra meeting, designed to co-ordinate the response to major emergencies.",
      "\"That's when you realised just how serious it was,\" the former council leader said. \"It wasn't just some hacker sat in a bedroom having a play with computers.\"",
      "While the system was being rebuilt, the council turned the clocks back and returned to using paper and pen. Many functions ground to a halt or were dramatically slowed down.",
      "Redcar husband and wife Paul and Clare were \"very reliant on the council\" at the time.",
      "Clare needed support from care workers and specialist equipment to help with a debilitating condition called functional neurological disorder.",
      "\"You'd be waiting on the phone for hours,\" Paul said. \"When people were coming it was handwritten notes, so the systems weren't getting updated. It was a real nightmare.\"",
      "The couple waited many months before they got the support they needed. In the meantime, Paul had quit his job to care for his wife.",
      "All the while staff continued to work on getting the council back online and within a few weeks a temporary system for social services had been restored.",
      "By May 2020 the council said it was still only back to 90%, with the system taking 10 months to be fully restored.",
      "\"Some of it was able to be recovered; a lot of it was needed to be built from scratch,\" said Mr Saunders. \"It was a very meticulous, very long process.\"",

      "A year later, in February 2023, a group of Russian hackers were sanctioned by UK and US government over a string of attacks on businesses, schools and councils, including Redcar and Cleveland.",
      "Earlier that year, Mrs Lanigan gave evidence in Parliament about the attack. She said the response had cost \u00a311.3m and they had received \u00a33.68m compensation from the government.",
      "As the authority was not insured for the attack, the difference had to be taken from its limited reserves.",
      "A council spokesman said that while it had general insurance cover, it still did not have a specific policy which covered a cyber-attack.",
      "They said a recent inspection by external auditors found that at the time the council had had proper arrangements and controls in place to reduce the likelihood of a cyber-security breach.",
      "But it is far from the only council to face such an attack. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, there were 202 ransomware attacks on local authorities in 2024.",
      "The government said it was \"taking action to protect local councils by providing funding to increase their cyber defences\".",
      "But Mr Martin fears the attack on the council, and other public services, could have \"shown hostile nation states how to disrupt our society\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly34p1jwvgo",
    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 23:39:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John described the government as \"absolute losers\" and said he feels \"incredibly betrayed\" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be \"committing theft, thievery on a high scale\".",
      "This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes.",
      "A government spokesperson said that \"no changes\" to copyright laws would be \"considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators\".",
      "Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.",
      "Sir Elton said the \"danger\" is that, for young artists, \"they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]\".",

      "On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used.",
      "But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it.",
      "Sir Elton warned the government was on course to \"rob young people of their legacy and their income\", adding that he thought the government was \"just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it\".",
      "The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"wise up\" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as \"a bit of a moron\".",

      "Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers \"do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way\".",
      "The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is \"on the brink\" of offering up the country's music industry \"as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants\".",
      "He added that the prime minister \"must not sell\" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators \"down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work\".",
      "Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joined more than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence.",
      "Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter, previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a \"Wild West\" in which artists' copyright was not properly protected.",

      "A data centre is a warehouse filled with computers that remotely power services such as AI, data processing, and streaming, but a single one can use the same amount of energy as a small town.",
      "Matt Garman, chief executive of AWS, told the BBC nuclear is a \"great solution\" to data centres' energy needs as \"an excellent source of zero carbon, 24/7 power\".",
      "AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK.",
      "The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030.",
      "The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today.",
      "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process.",
      "\"It's something we plan many years out,\" he said.",
      "\"We invest ahead. I think the world is going to have to build new technologies. I believe nuclear is a big part of that particularly as we look 10 years out.\"",

      "\"Why are data centre providers turning to nuclear? They will need a lot of energy, reliably,\" Mr Chisholm told the BBC.",
      "\"Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy.\"",

      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that modular reactors \"will play a particularly important roles in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we're shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country\"",
      "But this technology is many years away and new grid connections already take years to establish.",
      "Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\"",
      "\"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\".",

      "He said he understands why many are nervous.",
      "\"With any technology that is sufficiently new or hard to understand, people are probably appropriately scared of it initially, until they better understand it so that initial response is not particularly surprising.\"",

      "The firm said it was contacted by hackers who claimed to have gained access to customer information, obtained by making payments to Coinbase contractors and employees.",
      "In a blog post, Coinbase said the criminals had gained access to \"less than 1%\" of its customer data, which they then used to impersonate the firm and trick people into handing over their crypto.",
      "The group then demanded $20m from Coinbase to keep it quiet - but it refused to pay the bribe and instead promised to pay back every person who got scammed.",

    "story": [
      "Sneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up.",
      "Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling.",
      "Rising temperatures are even worse for outdoor workers. \"This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,\" Ms Sachar says.",
      "She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.",
      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",

      "These include organisations involved in supplying defence, IT services and logistics support.",
      "The security bodies of 10 Nato countries and Australia said Russian spies had used a combination of hacking techniques to gain access to networks.",
      "Some of the targets were internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian borders which monitored aid shipments going into the country.",

      "It adds the \"actors also used legitimate municipal services, such as traffic cams.\"",

      "The notorious hacking team is known to have previously leaked World Anti-Doping Agency data, and played a key role in the 2016 cyber-attack on the US's Democratic National Committee, according to security experts.",

      "The joint cyber-security advisory said Fancy Bear had targeted organisations linked to critical infrastructure including ports, airports, air traffic management and the defence industry.",
      "These were in 12 mainland European countries and the US.",
      "The hackers used a combination of techniques to gain access, the report said, including guessing passwords.",
      "Another method used is called spearphishing, where fake emails are targeted at specific people who have access to systems.",
      "They are presented with a fake page where they enter their login details, or encouraged to click a link which then installs malicious software.",
      "\"The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes,\" the report said.",
      "A vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook was also exploited to collect credentials \"via specially crafted Outlook calendar appointment invitations\".",
      "These kinds of techniques have been \"a staple tactic of this group for over a decade,\" Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at Sophos Counter Threat Unit, said.",

      "Fires were the main cause, overtaking land clearances from agriculture for the first time on record, with the Amazon faring particularly badly amid record drought.",
      "There was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss.",
      "Tropical rainforests store hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon in soils and woody trunks. But this new global record raises further questions about their resilience on a warming planet.",
      "Many researchers are concerned some forests, such as parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a \"tipping point\", beyond which they could fall into irreversible decline.",
      "\"The tipping point idea is, I think, increasingly the right one,\" said Prof Matthew Hansen, co-director of GLAD laboratory at the University of Maryland, which produces the data.",
      "Prof Hansen described the new results as \"frightening\", and warned of the possible \"savannisation\" of the rainforest, where old-growth tropical forests die back and permanently switch to savanna.",
      "\"It's still a theory, but I think that that's more and more plausible looking at the data.\"",
      "A separate study, published last week, made a similar warning of possible significant dieback of the Amazon if global warming exceeds the international target of 1.5C.",
      "This would not only threaten the vibrant array of wildlife living in these most biodiverse habitats, but would also have serious ramifications for the global climate.",
      "Until recently, the Amazon had been doing humanity a favour, absorbing more planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) than it released.",
      "But the burning of these forests emits huge amounts of CO2 \u2013 adding to warming rather than limiting it.",
      "In 2023-24, the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, fuelled by climate change and the natural warming El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Many fires are started deliberately to clear land for agriculture, making it difficult to disentangle the two.",
      "But the drought provided ideal conditions for fires to spread out of control, with Brazil and Bolivia most badly affected.",
      "While only a single year, it fits the expected pattern of more intense tropical fires in a warming world.",
      "\"I think we are in a new phase, where it's not just the clearing for agriculture that's the main driver,\" said Rod Taylor of the World Resources Institute (WRI), which is also behind the latest report.",
      "\"Now we have this new amplifying effect, which is a real climate change feedback loop, where fires are just much more intense and much more ferocious than they've ever been.\"",
      "In total, the record loss of the world's old-growth (primary) tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, the researchers estimate.",
      "That's roughly the same as the emissions of the European Union.",
      "Signs of progress",
      "Countries in South East Asia, however, bucked the global trend.",
      "The area of primary forest loss in Indonesia fell by 11% compared to 2023, for example, despite drought conditions.",
      "This was the result of a concerted effort by governments and communities working together to enforce \"no burning\" laws, according to Elizabeth Goldman, co-director of the Global Forest Watch project at WRI.",
      "\"Indonesia serves as a bright spot in the 2024 data,\" she said.",
      "\"Political will is a key factor of success - it's impossible otherwise,\" agreed Gabriel Labbate, head of climate change mitigation at the United Nations forests programme UNREDD, which was not involved in today's report.",
      "Other countries, including Brazil, have seen success in the past with similar approaches, but started to see losses increase again in 2014 following a change in government policies.",
      "Prof Hansen said that although the progress in South East Asia was positive, the fluctuations in forest loss in Brazil show that protection policies have to be consistent.",
      "\"The key we haven't seen yet is sustained success in reducing and maintaining low levels of conversion of these ecosystems and if you were interested in conserving the environment you have to win always and forever,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The researchers agree that this year's UN climate summit COP30 - which is being hosted in the Amazon - will be critical for sharing and promoting forest protection schemes.",
      "One proposal is to reward countries which maintain tropical forests through payments. The detail is still to be worked out but has promise, according to Rod Taylor.",
      "\"I think it's an example of an innovation that addresses one of the fundamental issues that at the moment there's more money to be made by chopping forests down than keeping them standing,\" he said.",

      "At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December.",
      "Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Syrian officials.",
      "'I'm overjoyed to be back': Syrians face daunting rebuild after years of war",

      "The US imposed sanctions on Syria in response to atrocities committed by forces loyal to Assad during the country's devastating 13-year civil war, in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced from their homes.",
      "The State Department had previously insisted on several conditions being met before they were lifted, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "Although Sharaa has promised to do that, the country has been rocked by two waves of deadly sectarian violence in recent months.",
      "In March, almost 900 civilians, mainly members of Assad's Alawite sect, were killed by pro-government forces across the western coastal region during fighting between security forces and former regime loyalists, according to one monitoring group. The loyalists reportedly killed almost 450 civilians and 170 security personnel.",
      "And at the start of May, more than 100 people were reportedly killed in clashes between gunmen from the Druze religious minority, the new security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters in two suburbs of the capital Damascus and the southern province of Suweida.",
      "Even before the violence, many members of minority communities were worried about the new transitional authorities, which are dominated by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It is a former al-Qaeda affiliate still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.",
      "Sharaa himself also continues to be listed by the US as a \"specially designated global terrorist\", although the Biden administration announced in December that the US would scrap the $10m (\u00a37.5m) bounty offered for his arrest.",
      "Despite Sharaa's past, Trump took the opportunity to meet him while attending a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia last week.",
      "Afterwards, the US president told reporters that he was a \"young, attractive guy\", adding: \"Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\"",
      "\"He's got a real shot at pulling it [Syria] together,\" he said, adding, \"it's a torn-up country\".",
      "Sharaa meanwhile said Trump's decision to lift the sanctions on Syria \"was a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth and lays the foundations for stability in the region\".",
      "Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington DC on Tuesday, Rubio quipped that \"the bad news is that the transitional authority figures... didn't pass their background check with the FBI\".",
      "\"But on the flip side of it is, if we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we did not engage them it was guaranteed to not work out,\" he added.",
      "\"In fact, it is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.\"",
      "He did not elaborate but said Syria's minorities were \"dealing with deep internal distrust... because Assad deliberately pitted these groups against each other\".",
      "He said the Trump decided to lift the sanctions quickly because \"nations in the region want to get aid in, want to start helping them. And they can't because they are afraid of our sanctions\".",
      "As Rubio spoke, European Union foreign ministers agreed to also lift economic sanctions on Syria.",

    "summary": "The foreign secretary said the move \"demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account\".",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has announced sanctions on Daniella Weiss, a far-right Israeli settler known as the \"godmother\" of the settler movement.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move \"demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account as Palestinian communities suffer violence and intimidation\".",
      "Weiss, 79, is the leader of a radical settler organisation called Nachala - or homeland - which has also been sanctioned.",
      "For decades, Weiss has been prominent in the founding of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this.",
      "In the UK sanctions sheet, Weiss was described as having been involved in \"threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting, acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals\".",
      "An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson described the sanctions - which also target two other settlers, two illegal settler outposts, and two organisations - as \"unjustified, and regrettable\".",
      "Weiss was recently featured in Louis Theroux's documentary \"The Settlers\" - and has been active in the movement to rebuild settlements in Gaza.",
      "Speaking to BBC News last year, she said: \"Gaza Arabs will not stay in the Gaza Strip. Who will stay? Jews.\"",
      "\"The world is wide,\" she added. \"Africa is big. Canada is big. The world will absorb the people of Gaza. How we do it? We encourage it. Palestinians in Gaza, the good ones, will be enabled. I'm not saying forced, I say enabled because they want to go.\"",
      "In response to the sanctions, Weiss said hundreds of families \"are prepared and ready to implement settlement in Gaza - immediately\".",
      "Nachala called for \"conquest, immigration and settlement in Gaza\" and added that it wants Israel to \"continue the war until the enemy is destroyed\".",
      "The UK also announced sanctions on two other settlers - Zohar Sabah and Harel David Libi, as well as the outposts Coco's Farm and Neria's Farm, and the organisation Libi Construction and Infrastructure LTD.",
      "Outposts are settlements built without official Israeli authorisation.",
      "\"The Israeli government has a responsibility to intervene and halt these aggressive actions. Their consistent failure to act is putting Palestinian communities and the two-state solution in peril,\" Lammy added.",
      "Additionally, the UK government announced it would pause free trade negotiations with Israel with immediate effect, saying \"it is not possible to advance discussions\" with \"a Netanyahu government that is pursuing egregious policies in the West Bank and Gaza\".",
      "An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson responded: \"If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy \u2014 that is its own prerogative.\"",
      "The move follows a strongly-worded joint-statement from the leaders of the UK, France and Canada on Monday which called on the Israeli government to \"stop its military operations\" and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\".",
      "Israel has said it will allow a \"basic amount of food\" into Gaza, ending an 11-week blockade of the territory, which it said was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release remaining hostages.",

    "story": [
      "This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon on trial in France who has admitted to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly under age, said he considers himself \"responsible\" for the death of two of his victims.",
      "Over the last few weeks, the court was shown the photos of two people whose relatives say died by suicide, following the trauma of being sexually assaulted by Le Scouarnec when they were children.",
      "One is not being named; the other is Mathias Vinet, who died at in 2021 after struggling with addiction. His grandparents told the BBC they blame Le Scouarnec for his death.",
      "\"I keep the memory of those two photos, [shown] right towards the end, during the last examinations,\" the former surgeon said. \"They died, and I am responsible.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec, 74, was being questioned in court in Vannes, Brittany, during the penultimate week of a long and gruelling trial which began in late February.",
      "In March, during a session held behind closed doors, Le Scouarnec - once a respected small-town surgeon - admitted to sexually abusing all 299 victims, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations, between 1989 and 2014. More than 250 of them were under the age of 15.",
      "His lawyer Maxime Tessier said he had asked Le Scouarnec if he admitted that the numerous people mentioned in his diaries were \"all potential victims of his acts and he said: 'Yes'\".",
      "At the start of the trial Le Scouarnec also told the court he \"committed despicable acts\" and \"understood and shared the suffering\" caused to many of his patients.",
      "Police were able to identify hundreds of victims thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec logged assaults he carried out in graphic detail.",
      "Many had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "For hundreds of hours over the course of the trial, Le Scouarnec has come face to face with dozens of his victims and their relatives.",
      "Many of them became emotional as they described how the abuse they endured shaped their lives; several said they have suffered from eating disorders, anxiety, depression or addiction.",
      "\"You got into my head, it's destroyed me, I became a whole other person I don't recognise anymore,\" Le Monde newspaper reported one victim as saying.",
      "One of the few victims who had memories of the abuse sustained at the hands of Le Scouarnec said that she was relieved when police contacted her to say her name appeared in the former surgeon's diaries.",
      "\"I have been waiting for your call for 30 years,\" she said, according to Le Monde.",
      "The newspaper also told the story of another victim who had no recollection of the abuse but said she nonetheless was \"convinced\" she had been raped. \"I wanted to die without even knowing why. He stole my youth,\" she told the court.",
      "Throughout the trial Le Scouarnec has apologised to his victims, often acknowledging that his acts had been \"revolting\".",
      "Romane Codou, a lawyer representing several victims, told French media that his admission of guilt had \"appeased\" the victims and \"allowed them to shut the door on an awful debate in which we were at the mercy of Joel Le Scouarnec\".",
      "A section of the trial was devoted to the cross-examination of medical professionals who worked in the same establishments as Le Scouarnec.",
      "Victims' lawyers and child protection advocacy groups have said \"institutional failings\" allowed the surgeon to continue working with children even after an FBI alert - issued in the early 2000s - warned French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites.",
      "The National Order of Doctors (Cnom), which has also filed a lawsuit against Le Scouranec, said in March that it \"expressed its deep regrets\" as he should have been \"prevented from practicing\".",
      "\"This situation has highlighted poor communication between the different entities of the Order of Doctors, and we deeply regret this,\" they said in a statement.",
      "Despite being the largest child abuse trial in French history, many victims have felt the proceedings have garnered relatively little attention in France.",
      "The Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec Collective group said it was \"stunned\" to see how the trial had failed to capture the attention of politicians and society at large.",
      "\"No lesson has been drawn from this, neither from the medical world nor from politicians,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "Le Scouarnec is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces. Now, he faces an additional 20-year sentence.",

    "summary": "The news that he has \"aggressive\" prostate cancer has some medics asking why it was not detected sooner.",
    "story": [
      "Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.",
      "Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier.",
      "Others pointed out that cancers can grow fast without the patient displaying symptoms - and that men over 70 are not routinely screened.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday his predecessor should have been more transparent with the public, seeming to imply that the cancer diagnosis had been covered up - a suggestion rejected by a Biden aide.",
      "\"I think it is very sad actually. I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,\" Trump said at an event at the White House.",
      "\"It could take years to get to this level of danger. So, look, it's a very, very sad situation. I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.\"",
      "A Biden aide said the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago.",
      "He had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test in 2014, the aide told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "\"Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" the aide added.",
      "The cancer diagnosis comes amid reports that the Democrat's aides sought to conceal other deteriorating health conditions from the public ahead of the 2024 election.",

      "Cancer touches us all, says Biden after outpouring",

      "Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. He dropped out of the race last summer after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.",
      "According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office.",
      "The authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.\"",
      "The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election.",
      "\"It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,\" Senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday.",
      "After the news of Biden's diagnosis, Vice-President JD Vance wished him well, but asked whether Biden's doctors or staff members had sought to keep the public from knowing about the true state of his health.",
      "\"This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,\" he added.",
      "Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who worked as a Covid adviser to the Biden White House, was among those claiming that Biden probably had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it.",
      "\"He did not develop in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president,\" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe show. \"He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.\"",
      "US medical guidelines do not recommend routine blood screenings for men over 70 because prostate cancers can be very slow-growing, and the difficulty of testing and treatment may outweigh the risk from the cancer.",
      "Biden had previously been diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate. In 2019, before he was elected, his campaign released the report from his medical screening, saying he had been treated with medication and surgery, \"and has never had prostate cancer\".",
      "That's led to questions about whether Biden was tested at any point during his four-year presidency - and why the diagnosis came so late.",
      "\"I would assume the former president gets a very thorough physical every year,\" Dr Chris George of the Northwestern Health Network told Reuters. \"It's sort of hard for me to believe that he's had a (blood test) within the past year that was normal.\"",
      "However, Dr Robert Figlin, interim director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer, told the BBC that the aggressive way Biden's cancer had presented was not that unusual. And he warned critics against \"assuming that somehow something was missed along the way\".",
      "Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer for men, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",

      "Tottenham held a team barbecue at their Hotspur Way training ground at the weekend, which Postecoglou says was player-driven, before arriving in Bilbao on Monday afternoon, taking up residence in a hotel right in the heart of the city.",
      "\"It was very important, being together, talking about life,\" said captain Son Heung-min. \"It feels like we are getting even closer.\"",
      "\"This bonding experience is very important,\" added right-back Pedro Porro. \"The team is like our family. It's very good to talk about life with our team-mates, too.\"",
      "United arrived a day later and opted to stay slightly further away from the stadium - only three miles, so not exactly a long journey.",
      "United also decided against taking up the option of a final training session in the match stadium. Most clubs these days don't train in the matchday venue before European games.",
      "The benefits of this are twofold. Firstly, it is far easier to keep their own training grounds secure and stop the opposition spying on them. Secondly, there is familiarity and ease of access to equipment, such as drones, that are now a vital part of team preparation.",
      "In all likelihood, Tottenham won't do anything of note in their final session at the San Mames stadium. But it will allow them to get the feel of the iconic ground.",
      "United will do a walk round instead. In fairness, it is only three weeks since they beat Athletic Club 3-0 there in the first leg of their semi-final, so the need to get accustomed to their surroundings is not the same.",
      "\"As the players we just think about what we have ahead of us, and what we have ahead of us is the chance to get our hands on a trophy,\" explained United captain Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Gary Pallister, a member of the United team which beat Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final to secure the first - and most pivotal - trophy of Sir Alex Ferguson's Old Trafford career - remembers the influence captain Bryan Robson had in those moments.",
      "\"When Robbo was there, we were a different team,\" said Pallister. \"He was injured so often that season. But when he played, you could almost feel it in the dressing room 'Robbo's here, everything will be OK. He will sort it out'.",
      "\"We were a team that relied on that. Over time, we had to learn to play without him but at that point, when he was out of the team, I felt we were a bit rudderless.",
      "\"He had played in two finals by then, whereas for me, I was going out to play in the biggest match [of the year], the game we grew up with as kids, the most special day of the year.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 21:03:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Pagasa is barely big enough for a plane to land, but it stands tall against an armada of Chinese ships.",
    "story": [
      "At just 37 hectares, the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa \u2013 or \"hope\" \u2013 is barely big enough to live on. There is almost nothing there.",
      "The 300 or so inhabitants live in a cluster of small, wooden houses. They fish in the clear, turquoise waters, and grow what vegetables they can in the sandy ground.",
      "But they are not alone in these disputed waters: just off shore, to the west, lies an armada of ships.",
      "These are all Chinese, from the navy, the coastguard or the so-called maritime militia \u2013 large fishing vessels repurposed to maintain Chinese dominance of this sea. As our plane approached the island we counted at least 20.",
      "For the past 10 years, China has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea, taking over submerged coral reefs, building three large air bases on them, and deploying hundreds of ships, to reinforce its claim to almost all of the strategic sea lanes running south from the great exporting cities on the Chinese coast.",
      "Few of the South East Asian countries which also claim islands in the same sea have dared to push back against China; only Vietnam and the Philippines have done so. The militaries of both countries are much smaller than China's, but they are holding on to a handful of reefs and islands.",
      "Pagasa \u2013 also known as Thitu and other names, as it is claimed by several other countries \u2013 is the largest of these.",
      "What makes it exceptional, though, is the civilian population, found on few islands in the South China Sea. From the point of view of the Philippines this, and the fact that Pagasa is solid land, not a partially submerged reef or sandy cay, strengthens its legal claims in the area.",
      "\"Pagasa is very important to us,\" Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the Philippines National Security Council, tells the BBC.",
      "\"It has a runway. It can support life \u2013 it has a resident Filipino community, and fishermen living there.",
      "\"And given the size of the island, one of the few that did not need reclaiming from the sea, under international law it generates its own territorial sea of 12 nautical miles.",
      "\"So it is, in a way, a linchpin for the Philippine presence.\"",
      "Reaching Pagasa is a two-to-three-day boat ride from the Philippines island of Palawan, or a one-hour plane ride, but both are at the mercy of frequent stormy weather.",
      "Until they surfaced the runway two years ago, and lengthened it to 1,300m (4,600ft), only small planes could land. Now they can bring in big C130 transport aircraft. Travelling in them, as we did, is a bit like riding a bus in rush hour.",
      "Everything has to be brought from the mainland, which is why our plane was packed, floor to ceiling, with mattresses, eggs, bags of rice, a couple of motorbikes and piles of luggage \u2013 not to mention lots of military personnel, most of whom had to stand for the entire flight.",
      "A lot has changed in recent years. There is a new hangar, big enough to shelter aircraft during storms. They are building a control tower and dredging a small harbour to allow bigger boats to dock. We were driven around the island by some of the Philippines marines who are stationed there, though given its size it hardly seemed necessary",
      "The Philippines seized Pagasa from Taiwan in 1971, when the Taiwanese garrison left it during a typhoon. It was formally annexed by the Philippines in 1978.",
      "Later, the government started encouraging civilians to settle there. But they need support to survive on this remote sliver of land. Families get official donations of food, water and other groceries every month. They now have electricity and mobile phone connectivity, but that only came four years ago.",
      "Aside from government jobs, fishing is the only viable way to make a living, and since the arrival of the Chinese flotillas even that has become difficult.",
      "Fisherman Larry Hugo has lived on the island for 16 years, and has chronicled the increasing Chinese control of the area. He filmed the initial construction on Subi Reef, around 32km (20 miles) from Pagasa, which eventually became a full-size military air base. One of his videos, showing his little wooden boat being nearly rammed by a Chinese coastguard ship in 2021 made him a minor celebrity.",
      "But Chinese harassment has forced him to fish in a smaller area closer to home.",
      "\"Their ships are huge compared to ours. They threaten us, coming close and sounding their horns to chase us away. They really scare us. So I no longer go to my old fishing grounds further away. I now have to fish close to the island, but the fish stocks here are falling, and it is much harder to fill our tubs like we used to.\"",
      "Realyn Limbo has been a teacher on the island for 10 years, and seen the school grow from a small hut to full-size school teaching more than 100 pupils, from kindergarten to 18 years old.",
      "\"To me this island is like paradise,\" she says. \"All our basic needs are taken care of. It is clean and peaceful \u2013 the children can play basketball or go swimming after school. We don't need shopping malls or all that materialism.\"",
      "Pagasa is really quiet. In the fierce midday heat we found most people snoozing in hammocks, or playing music on their porches. We came across Melania Alojado, a village health worker, rocking a small baby  to help it sleep.",
      "\"The biggest challenge for us is when people, especially children, fall ill,\" she says.",
      "\"If it is serious then we need to evacuate them to the mainland. I am not a registered nurse, so I cannot perform complicated medical tasks. But planes are not always available, and sometimes the weather is too rough to travel.",
      "\"When that happens we just have to care for them as best we can.\"",
      "But she too values the tranquillity of island life. \"We are free of many stresses. We get subsidised food, and we can grow some of our own. In the big city everything you do needs money.\"",
      "We saw a few new houses being built, but there really isn't room for Pagasa to accommodate many more people. With very few jobs, young people usually leave the island once they finish school. For all of its sleepy charm, and stunning white-sand beaches, it has the feel of a garrison community, holding the line against the overpowering Chinese presence which is clearly visible just offshore.",
      "\"The Chinese at the airbase on Subi Reef always challenge us when we approach Pagasa,\" the pilot says. \"They always warn us we are entering Chinese territory without permission.\"",
      "Do they ever try to stop you? \"No, it's a routine. We tell them this is Philippines territory. We do this every time.\"",
      "Jonathan Malaya says his government has made a formal diplomatic protest every week to the Chinese Embassy over the presence of its ships in what the Philippines views as the territorial waters of Pagasa. This is in marked contrast to the previous administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, which avoided confrontations with China in the hope of getting more investment in the Philippines.",
      "\"I think we will get more respect from China if we hold our ground, and show them we can play this game as well. But the problem of democracies like the Philippines is policies can change with new administrations. China does not have that problem.\"",

      "Fitness is one of the reasons Draper has had success on the clay - a surface he did not have much experience or joy on before this year.",
      "Draper retired injured on his French Open senior debut two years ago and later lamented being \"the guy who's injured a lot\" after retiring from three successive Grand Slam matches.",
      "But bringing in team members focused on fitness - Draper has hired physio Shane Annun and fitness trainer Matt Little, both former members of Murray's team - has paid off.",
      "Draper went through three successive five-set matches at the Australian Open and has been a constant presence on the tour since then.",
      "After reaching the Madrid final, Draper went straight to Rome for the Italian Open.",
      "The fatigue was obvious - Draper had to repeatedly yell at himself to get his energy going in his comeback victory against Corentin Moutet in the fourth round - but the ability to find a way through it, to win despite seemingly running on fumes, is key to clay-court success.",
      "Hitting with spin",
      "When you think of 14-time champion Rafael Nadal holding court at the French Open, it is his forehand that comes to mind; leaping into mid-air, left arm crossed across his chest, straight after lassoing a forehand winner across the clay.",
      "Nadal's lefty forehand was a weapon on all courts, but clay was where it really shone. The grip and follow-through, that whip across the body, allowed him to hit with heavy top spin - a key skill on clay.",
      "Adding more spin to the ball makes it bounce higher and pushes an opponent further back behind the baseline. The player will likely have to take the ball on the rise, meaning it is harder to control, particularly if they are shorter.",
      "\"Nadal knows how to manipulate the angles to get people out of position,\" Michael Chang, champion at Roland Garros in 1989, previously told BBC Sport.",
      "\"He is very aggressive, although patient when he needs to be, but for the most part if the shot is there he is taking it and going for it.",

    "story": [
      "I first met Nicholas Rossi - or Arthur Knight, as he insisted on being called - in February 2022 in a corridor at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.",
      "He was there to fight extradition to the US, where he was accused of rape.",
      "Sitting in his electric wheelchair, dressed in a three-piece suit and sporting a wide brimmed hat, the raspy voice behind the oxygen mask was telling anyone who would listen that this was all a terrible misunderstanding.",
      "His hands, meanwhile, were hoovering up reporters' business cards.",
      "Rossi's departure that day set the tone for what became a familiar scene - a slapstick performance in front of the cameras during which he tipped his wheelchair onto the pavement while trying to manoeuvre into a waiting taxi.",
      "Later that evening an unknown number flashed up on my mobile phone and I heard that same raspy voice.",
      "\"Hello Steven, it's Arthur\u2026 do you have a minute?\"",
      "And so began an exercise in separating fact from fiction that continues three years later, which I have explored in a new podcast as part of the Strange But True Crime series on BBC Sounds.",
      "The name Nicholas Rossi first came to wider attention in December 2021 when he was arrested on the Covid ward of a Glasgow hospital.",
      "Staff had recognised his mugshot and distinctive tattoos from an Interpol wanted notice.",
      "The problem for the American authorities was that the man they were seeking to extradite swore blind he was the victim of mistaken identity.",
      "He claimed he was Arthur Knight, an Irish-born orphan who had never been to America - and said he could prove it.",
      "A couple of weeks after our first phone-call, \"Arthur\" was sitting opposite me in a BBC studio, his wife Miranda by his side, telling his tale for the cameras.",
      "He said he grew up in care in Dublin and escaped to London as a teenager. There, he sold books with his friends at Camden market, like Del Boy from the comedy Only Fools and Horses.",

      "At times the conversation veered as wildly as his accent \u2013 from claims he survived the London Tube bombing (he got the date wrong) to a story about once meeting Del Boy's sidekick Rodney.",
      "He repeatedly denied being Nicholas Rossi, but when I asked about tattoos he said he was \"too tired\" to show me his arms.",
      "It was a surreal, unconvincing performance that was being watched across the Atlantic by plenty of people who recognised the main character.",
      "\"I'd know those hands anywhere,\" Mary Grebinski later told me.",
      "She'd been a college student in 2008 when Nicholas Rossi sexually assaulted her on the way to class. He was convicted and placed on the sex offenders register.",
      "In Dayton, Ohio \u2013 the city where that attack happened \u2013 I also spoke to Rossi's ex-wife.",
      "Kathryn Heckendorn said she had bought him the red silk pyjamas \"Arthur\" had been filmed wearing outside court.",
      "Their unhappy marriage lasted eight months. The judge who granted their divorce in 2016 said Rossi was guilty of \"gross neglect of duty and cruelty\" on account of his abusive behaviour.",
      "Conversations like this helped fill in the blanks.",
      "Nicholas Rossi was born Nicholas Alahverdian in 1987. Rossi was the name of his stepfather, who at the time was Rhode Island's premiere Engelbert Humperdinck impersonator.",
      "As a teenager he spent time in care and, years later, enjoyed a degree of local fame as a child welfare campaigner.",
      "When reports of Alahverdian's death emerged in 2020, politicians paid tribute from the floor of the Rhode Island State House.",
      "According to an online obituary his last words were: \"Fear not and run towards the bliss of the sun.\"",
      "But it didn't take long for this deception to begin unravelling.",
      "A priest who had been asked to arrange a memorial mass was warned by a detective not to go ahead because \"Nicholas isn't dead\".",
      "Instead, the authorities suspected Rossi was somewhere in the UK, having fled after discovering that the FBI were investigating an alleged credit card fraud.",
      "It was his online footprint that ultimately led police to his hospital bedside in Glasgow \u2013 ironically as the fugitive was recovering from a genuine near-death experience in the shape of Covid.",
      "At one of his early extradition hearings the sheriff commented that advancing the case shouldn't be \"rocket science\".",
      "But the legal process dragged on and on \u2013 in large part due to Rossi's antics.",
      "There were rambling courtroom monologues, questionable medical episodes and theatrical outbursts which were often directed at his own lawyers as a prelude to sacking them.",
      "Sitting in the public gallery, it was rarely dull. Rossi's claim that a corrupt hospital employee called Patrick tattooed him while he was in a coma was one of the more memorable exchanges.",
      "In the end the sheriff's conclusion was that the Arthur Knight charade was \"implausible\" and \"fanciful\".",
      "And yet Rossi stuck to his story \u2013 even as his extradition was approved and High Court judges refused his appeal.",
      "He stuck to his story as US Marshalls bundled him onto a private jet and as prison guards booked him into the Utah County jail.",
      "He stuck to his story in a Utah courtroom, until suddenly he didn't.",
      "In October last year I tuned in to a routine bail hearing online when, without warning, the posh English persona disappeared.",
      "Speaking in a clear American accent he told the judge he was born Nicholas Alahverdian before his name changed to Rossi.",
      "As he claimed to have hidden his identity to escape \"death threats\", I found myself wondering why he'd chosen that specific moment for the mask to slip.",
      "The saga continues, but the novelty has worn off.",
      "The intrigue and farce has been stripped away while the serious allegations remain.",
      "In August, Nicholas Rossi is due to face the first of two separate rape trials. He denies all the charges."

    "story": [
      "Israel went to war after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 armed with an arsenal of weapons mostly paid for, supplied and then resupplied by the United States.",
      "Its other allies gave Israel something just as potent in its own way: a deep credit of goodwill and solidarity, based on revulsion at the killings of 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and the sight of 251 people being dragged into captivity in Gaza as hostages.",
      "Now it seems that Israel's credit has gone, at least as far as France, the United Kingdom and Canada are concerned. They have issued their strongest condemnation yet of the way Israel is fighting the war in Gaza.",
      "Israel, they say, must halt its new offensive, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will destroy Hamas, rescue the remaining hostages and put all of Gaza under direct Israeli military control.",
      "Live coverageIsraeli strikes kill at least 38 people in half-hour period, medics sayUN calls five trucks of aid 'drop in ocean' of what's needed",

      "Israeli strikes kill at least 38 people in half-hour period, medics say",
      "UN calls five trucks of aid 'drop in ocean' of what's needed",
      "Their statement dismisses Netanyahu's arguments and calls for a ceasefire. Together, the three governments say that they \"strongly oppose the expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\" adding: \"The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable.\"",
      "They call for the release of the remaining hostages and recall that after the \"heinous attack\" on 7 October they believed that the Israeli state \"had a right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate\".",
      "Netanyahu's decision to allow what he called \"minimal\" food into Gaza was they said \"wholly inadequate\".",
      "Netanyahu has hit back, saying the \"leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities\".",
      "He insisted the war could end if Hamas returned hostages, laid down its arms, agreed for its leaders to go into exile and Gaza was demilitarised. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu - who is sought under an International criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he has dismissed as \"antisemitic\" - had been under heavy international pressure to end the blockade of Gaza after a respected international survey warned of imminent famine.",
      "At the London summit between the EU and the UK the President of the European Council, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, called the humanitarian crisis in Gaza \"a tragedy where international law is being systematically violated, and an entire population is being subjected to disproportionate military force\".",
      "\"There must be safe, swift and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu's reluctant decision to allow in limited supplies was condemned by his ultra nationalist coalition partners.",
      "The Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, convicted in 2007 for incitement to racism and supporting an extremist Jewish group that Israel classifies as a terrorist organisation, complained that Netanyahu's decision would \"fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels\".",
      "Only five trucks made it into Gaza on Monday, as Israeli troops advanced and air and artillery strikes killed more Palestinian civilians including many young children.",
      "Opponents of Israel's destruction of Gaza and the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians will say the governments of France, the UK and Canada are speaking out far too late.",
      "Many of them have held months of demonstrations protesting about the death and destruction in Gaza \u2013 and more killing of Palestinian civilians and confiscation of land in the West Bank, the other side of the Palestinian territories, during military operations and raids by armed Jewish settlers.",
      "But sometimes in the politics of war, a single incident carries symbolic power that clarifies and crystallises so sharply that it can force governments to action. This time it was the killing on 23 March by Israeli forces in Gaza of 15 paramedics and aid workers.",
      "It came after Israel, on 18 March, had broken a ceasefire that had held for two months with a series of massive air strikes.",
      "Five days into the renewed war an Israeli unit attacked the medical convoy, and covered the men they had killed and their bullet ridden vehicles with the sand. The Israeli account of what happened was shown to be untrue when a mobile phone was recovered from a body in the mass grave.",
      "Its owner had filmed the incident before he was killed. Far from proving Israel's claim that the emergency workers were a potential threat to the Israeli combat soldiers, the video from the grave showed that clearly marked and well-lit ambulances and emergency vehicles were attacked systematically until almost everyone inside them was killed.",
      "Alarm has been growing fast since then, not just among Israel's usual opponents. Its European allies, with President Macron of France leading the way, have been toughening their language. The statement calling for an end to Israel's offensive is their harshest criticism of Israel so far.",
      "A senior European diplomatic source involved in their discussions told me that the tough language reflected a \"real sense of growing political anger at the humanitarian situation, of a line being crossed, and of this Israeli government appearing to act with impunity\".",
      "More ominously for Israel, the statement says that \"we will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete steps in response\".",
      "They do not specify what those might be. Sanctions could be one possibility. A bigger step would be to recognise Palestine as an independent state.",
      "France has been considering joining the 148 other states that have done so at a conference it is co-chairing with Saudi Arabia in New York in early June. The UK has also talked about Palestinian recognition with the French.",
      "Israel, pushing back hard, has told them they would be presenting Hamas with a victory. But the tone of the statement made by the French, the Canadians and the British suggests that Israel is losing its ability to pressurise them."

      "The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU.",
      "BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers.",
      "Food",
      "Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks",
      "Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached",
      "Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU \u2013 including food products \u2013 have faced new checks and extra paperwork.",
      "Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules.",
      "UK food exports to the EU have fallen \u2013 with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 \u2013 and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape.",
      "Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers.",
      "If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats.",
      "Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023 were worth \u00a314bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales.",
      "But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards \u2013 a system known as \"dynamic alignment\" \u2013 and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area.",
      "The UK will also have to make a financial contribution. However it is currently unknown how much this will be and when it will be required.",
      "Fishing",
      "Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters",
      "Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access",
      "Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy - just 0.04% of GDP in 2024 - it is politically sensitive.",
      "The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.",
      "Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",
      "Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK/EU summit",
      "Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended.",
      "Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\"",
      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",
      "In 2023, the UK exported \u00a31.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports.",
      "Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would \"speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market\".",
      "Youth mobility",
      "Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two",
      "Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary",
      "The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30.",
      "However, the impact of what is being called a \"youth experience scheme\" could be uneven.",
      "Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.",
      "And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to \"significantly\" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels.",
      "Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive.",
      "However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.",
      "\"If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,\" she said.",
      "eGates",
      "Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when",
      "Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer",
      "As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer.",
      "The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\"",
      "However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\".",
      "It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.",
      "Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.",
      "EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders.",
      "Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says.",
      "Defence",
      "Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund",
      "Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues",
      "The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm.",
      "This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK.",
      "The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directly employs about164,00 people in the UK.",
      "Between 2020 and 2024, the UK was estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute to have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter.",
      "Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund.",

      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",

      "\"We had to train to know what it was like, how to survive, how to work out there,\" she said.",
      "Atwell's character represents a departure from typical action film roles for women. Rather than serving as a romantic interest, Grace develops what Atwell calls a \"nuanced intimacy\" with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.",
      "\"The woman is not just the object of desire or not led with a romantic agenda,\" Atwell said, \"There's intellectual stimulation between them, common cause that brings them together, something that feels sibling-like, maternal.\"",
      "Working alongside Cruise for five years has given Atwell insight into the actor's off-camera persona. The two have become close, he even took her grandmother on a helicopter ride at sunset on Christmas Eve.",
      "\"For a man who is an aerobatic pilot, seeing him be so gentle and kind and patient with her and explaining how everything worked, that to me was like just a mark of a really decent guy,\" she said.",
      "To prepare for her role as a thief, Atwell practiced sleight-of-hand techniques, even successfully stealing items from Cruise during filming, including salt and pepper shakers, a watch, a necklace and gym socks.",
      "\"I've never been a thief before. So I needed to practice,\" she said.",
      "Atwell describes \"The Final Reckoning\" as \"the culmination of all the movies that's gone before\" that \"ties up plot points and characters that people have been watching for the last 30 years.\" The film received a five-minute standing ovation at its debut in France.",
      "Despite the film's title suggesting the end, Atwell remained coy about whether this truly ends the franchise.",
      "\"I'm not the head of the studio. I'm just an actor for hire. I have no idea,\" she said when pressed about potential sequels.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues\u00a0in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",

    "story": [
      "At the\u00a0sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, testified for multiple days. Her testimony was completed on Friday.",
      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit she filed in 2023. The lawsuit was settled the day after she filed it. Combs denied the allegation.",
      "Text messages",
      "During cross-examination Thursday and Friday, the defense asked Ventura about numerous text messages she and Combs exchanged over the course of their relationship.",
      "They included affectionate messages where Ventura told Combs she loved him and saw a future with him, potentially one that involved starting a family.",
      "Other messages related to the alleged \"freak offs,\" including one exchange allegedly coordinating one of them.",
      "\"You told him you wanted to do freak offs?\" they asked Ventura at one point, to which she replied, \"No, there's a lot more to that.\"",
      "During redirect on Friday, Ventura told prosecutors there were times Combs was kind and loving, but they didn't last.",
      "She said Combs' moods affected her life, career and how she felt about herself, and if Combs wanted a \"freak off,\" then her work would take a backseat.",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Spikevax and Comirnaty should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury.

      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",
      "Ten other senior investigators \u2013 Miguel Holmgren, Steve Jacobson, Dorian McGavern, Joseph Mindell, Katherine Roche, Zu-Hang Sheng, David R. Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",

      "Out of 4,509 drowning deaths reported in 2022, the CDC's modeling found that 51 likely could have been prevented by better pool fencing, and 297 could have been prevented by victims wearing a life jacket during a boating accident.",

      "The FDA previously said that it thought azodicarbonamide remained safe to add to food, after studying how much semicarbazide Americans might be eating. The agency said studies in some mice found that semicarbazide could cause tumors, but only at levels that \"far exceed\" the estimated amounts people are eating through bread and other foods.",

      "\"This is very clich\u00e9, but it truly gave me my life back,\" he said.",
      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",

      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",
      "All 12 patients were able to complete both courses of treatment without reporting any serious side effects, according to Bradley.",
      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",
      "While there were no serious adverse effects reported, every patient didn't have the same life-changing experience as Deming says he experienced. Though many did report their motor and cognitive functions improved afterwards, per Bradley.",
      "\"We don't have a reason to believe that this is a treatment that is going to be a good fit for every patient. That is never really our expectation in medicine. But our goal is to figure out when is it the right treatment and how much for which patient,\" Bradley said.",
      "Bradley says her team is scaling up their work and are in the process of recruiting for a larger study, due to the success with the initial research.",
      "\"That was really exciting just to see that promising safety profile in this initial pilot. That kind of gives us a green light to go forward with more in-depth research,\" she said. \"We really desperately need new treatments for Parkinson's. It's a very quickly growing disease that's becoming more and more prevalent in our population, so, we really feel like we have to be investigating every possible route that could mean new treatments for patients.\"",

      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as it instantaneously generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature which will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed.

      "\"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog\u00a0post. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added.",

At $61 per square foot, Flint also boasts the lowest median home price.",
      "It's inventory is good, too: Nearly 21% of houses in the city are vacant, making it a buyer's market and offering prospective homebuyers plenty of options.",
      "Detroit, Michigan, is the second most affordable city for homebuyers, according to the study, which compared costs across 300 U.S. cities. Median house prices are relatively low, and over 22% of the city's housing is vacant.",
      "Pittsburgh ranked third-most affordable city to buy a house. Homebuyers there can get more bang for their buck than renters.",
      "Least affordable cities",
      "By contrast, Santa Barbara, California, is the most expensive city in the U.S. for homebuyers, primarily because of its low housing affordability, among other factors. Also in California, Santa Monica ranked 299th in terms of housing affordability, while Berkeley ranked third to last. Berkeley has the lowest rent-to-price ratio of the 300 cities, meaning its more cost-effective to rent there, than to buy a home.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 07:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",
      "You can also avoid entering default and having wages garnished through loan consolidation. Essentially, this process replaces your old debt with a new loan that's in good standing and on which you can start making payments. If you're able to repay your loans in full, that's another way to exit default.",

      "Electric grid operators across the U.S. have been sounding the alarm in advance of elevated summer temperatures after record-breaking heat last year. The World Meteorological Organization said in its annual\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0that 2024 set a new global\u00a0temperature record, averaging over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions.

Located southwest of downtown Orlando, Epic Universe is the first major theme park to open in Florida in more than 25 years and is expected to ramp up competition with Walt Disney World Resort, a fixture in Orlando, Florida, since 1971 when it first opened.",
      "\"Is Epic Universe going to put Disney out of business? Absolutely not,\" said Dennis Speigel, founder and CEO of consulting firm International Theme Park Services. \"Is it going to put a chink in their armor? Yeah.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 15:10:37 -0400",
    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",
      "\"Families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems,\" he said.",

      "Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities.",
      "Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+.",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans plan to move ahead with a vote this week on the legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, which includes spending on tax cuts, as well as border security and defense priorities. Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-social-services-housing-nutrition/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",

    "summary": "President Trump and the South African president clashed over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Rampahosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Rampahosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans. The president said the images show burial sites of White farmers.",
      "After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "summary": "DHS officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam, and all had criminal convictions.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",
      "The officials, however, declined to confirm the final destination of the flight or any formal arrangement with South Sudan's government, citing operational and safety concerns. The officials also said they could not disclose the exact whereabouts of the detainees.",
      "Following an emergency motion by the lawyers who alerted him of the potential deportation flight to South Sudan, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, ordered the Trump administration late Tuesday to retain \"custody and control\" of the would-be deportees.",
      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, President Trump's administration has staged an intense diplomatic effort to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees.",
      "Early on in Mr. Trump's second term, U.S. officials deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees accused of being gang members to El Salvador, where they remain detained at a notorious mega prison.",
      "CBS News and other outlets reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was preparing to send migrants to Libya, but that flight never materialized once those reports surfaced.",

The boy was born last month while Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, remained in ICE custody in Louisiana.",

It is deliberate violence, the calculated cruelty of a government that tears families apart without remorse.\"",
      "The ACLU said the refusal by ICE and the prison contractor GEO Group came after multiple requests from Khalil's legal team pointing to federal policies that encourage contact visits between children and their detained parents. Officials, they said, cited \"a blanket no-contact visitation policy at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center (CLIPC) and unspecified 'security concerns' relating to the presence of a mother and newborn baby in an unsecure part of the facility.\"",

      "Mr. Trump met Tuesday morning with House Republicans as leaders ramp up their efforts to push the bill over its last hurdle in the Rules Committee before it can get to the House floor for a vote.",
      "The president put pressure on members to fall in line Tuesday as the party's dueling factions have threatened to upend the plan with demands that will be difficult to reconcile. When he arrived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any GOP member who doesn't back what he and Republicans have deemed the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" a warning to a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday evening. He told reporters he would vote \"no\" on the package in its current form.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ahead of the second meeting with the president, \"we're going to move forward with the vote later on.\"",
      "\"We've got to keep the bill moving,\" he said. \"Because there's a lot more steps in the process. The Senate, of course, has to go and do their work.\"",
      "But before a floor vote, the legislation will have to make it through the Rules Committee, the last stop for most legislation before the full House\u00a0votes on a measure. The committee began meeting shortly after 1 a.m., and was still meeting into the afternoon on Wednesday.",
      "\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said at the start of the meeting.",
      "Republicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"",
      "The committee's rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "Conservatives, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.",
      "\"I don't think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"",
      "The conservative holdouts did not offer details on the proposal they said the White House has offered. But the caucus was set to meet with Mr. Trump Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by Johnson, CBS News confirmed.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Though a manager's amendment, which will include the changes negotiated to the package in recent days, has yet to be released, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.",
      "Right-wing Republicans aren't the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans oppose a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they have threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met.",
      "Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\u00a0wealthy homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also point out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the SALT cap, but balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package because they think that's still too low.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said ahead of the meeting with the president on Tuesday that the group of moderates had no plans to cave. And on his message to conservatives, Lawler told reporters, \"if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.\"",
      "\"The fact is, we wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine who won,\" Lawler said.",
      "Mr. Trump also weighed in on the SALT issue, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",
      "Johnson said at a news conference following the meeting that leadership would work to \"gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican conference and tie up the remaining loose ends.\"",

      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",
      "Meink said turning any civilian aircraft to Air Force One standards \"will take significant modifications.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said it will bring an end to investigations launched during the Biden administration after the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is starting the process of dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, bringing an end to investigations launched during former President Joe Biden's administration. It will also put an end to proposed accountability agreements with the departments.",
      "The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.",
      "The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.",
      "\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"",
      "In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration's findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.",
      "The Justice Department's decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\u00a0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.",
      "In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"",
      "\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.",
      "Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.",
      "Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"",
      "\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.",
      "The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd's death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.",
      "The probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd's death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin's use of force against Floyd.",
      "Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.",
      "The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration's decision to dismiss the consent decree case.",
      "\"We're doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree\u2014because accountability isn't optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we've made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"",
      "As for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department's investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.",
      "Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor's death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.",
      "But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"",
      "The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.",
      "\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Dhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there's local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"",
      "Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department's decision.",
      "\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district judge ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group that filed a FOIA request for its records.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to halt a lower court order that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group in a lawsuit that tests whether the task force is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The request from Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose out of a public records request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Amy Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including to depose Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "\"Canceling any government contract would seem to require substantial authority \u2014 and canceling them on this scale certainly does. Again, USDS reportedly is leading the charge on these actions, not merely advising others to carry them out,\" Cooper wrote in a March decision.",
      "He noted that DOGE likely has some independent authority to terminate federal employees, programs and contracts.",
      "\"Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does,\" Cooper said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the federal appeals court in Washington to halt the order, which it agreed to do temporarily. Then, last week, a panel of judges on the appeals court lifted its stay, which clears the way for DOGE to hand over the documents sought by CREW. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the discovery ordered by the district court is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "DOGE now has until June 3 to turn over documents, and Gleason's deposition must be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute over the efforts to learn more about DOGE, its work and employees turns on whether the task force is subject to FOIA, the federal law that allows members of the public to request access to records and information from federal agencies. FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal courts and entities within the Executive Office of the President.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President tasked with providing recommendations to Mr. Trump and federal agencies on policy matters that are important to the president's agenda. Sauer said that as a result of those functions, DOGE is exempt from FOIA.",
      "Sauer claimed that the district court's order requiring DOGE to hand over information through the discovery process to determine if it is covered by FOIA turns the public records law \"on its head\" and violates the separation of powers by subjecting it to \"intrusive discovery.\"",
      "He warned that if it is allowed to stand, several components of the White House like the offices of the chief of staff, national security adviser, and other advisers to the president would be subject to FOIA.",
      "\"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations \u2014 threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE when he returned White House as part of an effort to shrink the size of the federal government. The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have said in court filings that he is not an employee of the entity and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE eventually led the White House to declare Gleason as its acting administrator. Gleason worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",
      "Still, since its establishment, DOGE employees have fanned out across federal agencies to implement cost-cutting measures and were behind steep reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of DOGE's efforts, as well as Musk's role within the task force have been subject to legal challenges.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently weighing an emergency appeal involving DOGE's attempts to gain access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration and was asked to intervene in a legal battle over reductions in force at 21 agencies.",

      "Connolly, a Democrat, has represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of the region outside of Washington, D.C., since 2009. He announced in November that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
      "But the Virginia Democrat said in an open letter to his constituents last month that while the cancer was initially beaten back after treatments, it had returned. He said at the time that his \"sun is setting on my time in public service.\"",

      "\"We were fortunate to share Gerry with Northern Virginia for nearly 40 years because that was his joy, his purpose, and his passion,\" they said. \"His absence will leave a hole in our hearts, but we are proud that his life's work will endure for future generations.

    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",

      "The instructions to local police departments for funding in 2025 mark a noticeable shift from the guidance issued by the Justice Department during the Biden administration a year earlier.",
      "The 2024 guidance prioritized efforts at \"building trust and legitimacy with the community\" and \"community violence intervention\" initiatives, which include efforts to combat racism, trauma, poverty and other triggers to violence.",
      "The Trump administration has shifted the grant instructions for 2025 to invite police to make a compelling argument that the money will help stiffen border security, reduce violent crime, improve police departments' public image, support \"opioids and drug market interruption\" and other priorities.",
      "Both the 2024 and 2025 instructions have an \"Open Topic Area\" for grant applications that don't fit into any of the listed categories.",
      "The change of language raises the prospect of a dramatic shift in which police agencies are granted money and what programs are approved for federal help.",
      "The Justice Department's COPS community policing development grants program has awarded more than $67 million to dozens of police agencies since 2023, including for some cities as large as New York, Boston and Los Angeles, and those as small as Bluefield, W.Va., and Bellevue, Neb., according to a review by CBS News.",
      "The shift could imperil money from some projects that have been highly touted in small and large U.S. cities.",
      "\"These are some significant changes,\" said Chiraag Baines, a former Justice Department attorney and Biden administration aide. \"There's a broader impact to this than just grant money. It's a statement about priorities and it could encourage police to give less priority to certain programs and initiatives if they think the Administration is going to be hostile to them.\"",
      "Baines said the newly-listed priorities for projects combatting violent crime and opioid abuse are important. But he added the new language encouraging police to apply for money for projects that \"uplift the image of law enforcement\" is a change \"that really confuses the issue. Police should be working to build trust and cooperation.\"",
      "Communities have proudly announced their grant awards for \"community violence interventions\" during the Biden administration.",
      "Cleveland Heights, Ohio, touted a program that got a 2023 grant as a successful initiative to reach at-risk youths. The city's announcement of the grant said the $175,000 award would be used for \"foot patrols in violence-impacted areas and forming a new outreach and mentorship program for Cleveland Heights.\"",
      "St. Petersburg, Fla., police are among the dozens of departments and cities to receive grants for initiatives to build \"trust and legitimacy with the community\" since 2021, including an approximately $174,000 grant in 2022.",
      "The agency told CBS News it used the grant to \"support 20 non-profit youth sports leagues.\" The police department also \"collaborated with the Tampa Bay Rays Baseball team to offer softball programs for at-risk girls, increasing access and participation.\"",
      "St. Petersburg won another $175,000 COPS grant, for police to help \"underserved populations\" in 2023. The department told CBS News it used the money for \"arts and educational mentorship\" for youth.",
      "The changes mark a paradigm shift, and have inflamed criticism from congressional Democrats. Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Democrat who was once a state prosecutor in Maryland, told CBS News, \"It is really a marked change in priorities from the last administration. Local communities count on these funds to augment their community policing efforts. Safer communities start with trust and security not fear and distrust. COPS grants should build up the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve, not tear them apart.\"",
      "A former Justice Department official who served in prior administrations told CBS News the shifting of grant criteria is common when the department changes leadership. But the official said the shift away from community violence intervention programs is a \"recipe for depriving law enforcement of the leads and witnesses that can solve cases and prevent crime. Community police cuts crime because people trust the police enough to work with them.\"",
      "Justice Department officials declined to answer specific questions about the changes in grant application language.",
      "A spokeswoman told CBS News in a written statement, \"Under the direction of Attorney General Bondi, the COPS office is committed to highlighting the important work that our law enforcement partners do and to supporting law enforcement through hiring and grant assistance.\"",
      "A review of prior COPS grants announcements shows a shift of language after then-President Joe Biden took office. The language in the 2022 COPS hiring grant fact sheet for police departments eliminated references from the first Trump administration that specified money was available for initiatives that focused on homeland security and school-based policing, and added language prioritizing \"diversity training\" projects.",
      "Even in a distinctively polarized political climate, federal COPS grants remain overwhelmingly popular and highly pursued by local police agencies. Grant awards are regularly touted by members of congress from both parties and publicly announced by local officials as victories for the community.",
      "A bipartisan group of federal legislators has introduced a bill to beef up funding for overall COPS grants. Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat whose district includes smaller communities in the Hudson Valley, co-sponsored the bill and said, \"Far too often, small and midsized police departments like ours lack the resources they need.\"",
      "Rep. Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican who co-sponsored the measure, wrote, \"Every Iowa town deserves strong public safety, regardless of size or geography, and I'm proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to boost hiring and resources for law enforcement in our small and rural communities.\" Nunn's announcement said the proposal would \"reauthorize the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program with double the amount of federal funding.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Alexandria, Va., police department, which received a $175,000 grant last year to help serve \"underserved populations,\" told CBS News, \"The Department of Justice COPS Office plays a vital role in supporting law enforcement agencies across the country. Their funding and technical assistance have been instrumental in helping departments build long-standing relationships between police and the communities they serve.\"",
      "Some city officials and police departments declined to comment on their federal COPS grant awards, including Dearborn, Mich., which received an $88,816 grant for \"building trust\" in police in 2023.",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, engaged in a heated exchange Tuesday as the nation's top diplomat defended the Trump administration's foreign policy while testifying to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "For seven minutes, Van Hollen criticized Rubio on his handling of issues ranging from the freezing of humanitarian assistance in Sudan during a genocide, deportations to El Salvador without due process and revoking student visas.",
      "\"You and I served together in Congress for 15 years,\" Van Hollen said. \"We didn't always agree, but I believe we shared some common values \u2014 a belief in defending democracy and human rights abroad and honoring the Constitution at home. That's why I voted to confirm you. I believed you would stand up for those principles. You haven't. You've done the opposite.\"",
      "Van Hollen continued, \"You used to speak with conviction about the importance of foreign aid as a tool to advance American values and interests. Then you stood by while Elon Musk took a chainsaw to USAID and other assistance programs.\"",
      "The senator said people have died as a result of the gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Earlier this year, Rubio said 83% of programs funded by the federal agency were being canceled after it became a target for the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Van Hollen also said that Rubio has \"made a mockery of our country's refugee process, turning it into a system of global apartheid where political ideology and race more than truth or need matter.\" The criticism was in reference to the Trump administration granting refugee status to White South Africans over claims that they have faced discrimination by the country's post-apartheid government.",
      "\"I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you as secretary of state,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said Van Hollen's regret \"confirms I'm doing a good job.\"",
      "The exchange also turned toward\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was\u00a0mistakenly deported\u00a0by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision, instructed you to facilitate the return to the United States of Abrego Garcia, who the administration admitted was wrongfully deported to El Salvador,\" Sen Van Hollen said. \"Your response, you have openly flouted judicial orders. When asked whether you had been in touch with El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, you boasted, 'I would never tell you that, and you know who else I would never tell, a judge.'\"",
      "Rubio responded, \"No judge in the judicial branch can tell me or the president how to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Rubio ridiculed the senator for traveling to El Salvador to visit Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"We deported gang members, gang members, including the one you had a margarita with,\" Rubio said, referring to false claims that the senator drank margaritas during their April meeting. \"And that guy is a human trafficker, and that guy is a gang banger.\"",

      "The news was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The Justice Department had no comment when reached by CBS News.",
      "In a statement, Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesperson, said the former governor has not had any contact from law enforcement about the case or received any subpoenas.",
      "\"We have never been informed of any such matter, so why would someone leak it now?\" Azzopardi said. \"The answer is obvious: This is lawfare and election interference plain and simple\u2014something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans have pressed the Justice Department to investigate Cuomo for months, accusing him of lying to Congress during an investigation into coronavirus deaths in nursing homes \u2014 an issue critics have long accused Cuomo of mishandling.",
      "In a criminal referral last year, a House panel on the COVID-19 pandemic alleged Cuomo was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths, but he testified to the committee in June 2024 that he was not involved. The referral claims Cuomo violated a law against making false statements to Congress.",
      "The Biden-era Justice Department did not act on the referral. But after President Trump returned to office, Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, urged federal prosecutors to look into the case, alleging Cuomo was \"caught red-handed lying to Congress.\"",
      "\"Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the Subcommittee \u2014 but from the beginning this was all transparently political,\" Azzopardi told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump's Justice Department has faced scrutiny for its handling of criminal cases involving Democrats.",
      "Months before the Cuomo investigation became public, the Justice Department drew criticism for ending a criminal prosecution of Adams \u2014 one of Cuomo's rivals in the mayoral race \u2014 for alleged bribery and campaign finance offenses. One of the department's top leaders said the charges had impeded Adams' ability to run for reelection or govern the city, and had made it harder for Adams to cooperate with the federal government on crime.",
      "Several members of the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office resigned in protest and accused the administration of a quid pro quo, effectively letting Adams off in exchange for his cooperation with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The Trump administration and Adams have denied any quid pro quo.",
      "This week, federal prosecutors charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, with felony assault during a clash at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark. Prosecutors claim she assaulted a federal law enforcement officer, but she called the charges \"purely political.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 whose office sued Mr. Trump for fraud \u2014 was referred for criminal prosecution by the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency last month.

    "story": [
      "Immigration lawyers told a federal judge on Tuesday that they received information indicating the U.S. government may have put migrants from countries like Myanmar and Vietnam on a deportation flight to South Sudan, an eastern African nation plagued by conflict and political instability.",
      "In an emergency filing to the federal district court in Massachusetts, the attorneys said the reported deportation flight to South Sudan would directly violate a ruling issued by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy that barred the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without affording them certain due process rights.",
      "The lawyers said any migrant deported to South Sudan \"faces a strong likelihood of irreparable harm,\" citing reports documenting widespread violence, human rights violations and conflict in the landlocked African country, the world's youngest nation.",
      "Soon after its independence in 2011, South Sudan endured a bloody civil war \u2014 and fears of a new conflict have recently surfaced. The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for South Sudan, warning Americans not to travel there due to \"crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "The emergency motion asked Murphy to prohibit deportations of third-country deportees to South Sudan, and to order the return of those deported there, if the removals had already occurred.",
      "Late on Tuesday, Murphy ordered the Trump administration to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants reportedly being sent to South Sudan or another third country, to ensure they can return to the U.S. if he finds their deportation to be unlawful. He instructed government lawyers to be ready to provide certain information during a hearing scheduled for Wednesday, including the names of the deportees and details on what level of due process they received.",
      "The U.S. government has not publicly confirmed an arrangement to deport migrants who are not from South Sudan to that country. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has been mounting an aggressive diplomatic campaign to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching far-flung nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees. It has already deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees to El Salvador.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News and other outlets reported the administration had made plans to send migrants to Libya, but that flight never materialized once those reports surfaced.",
      "In April, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, barred the government from deporting migrants to third countries, unless it first provided them and their lawyers notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation.",

She was told her client had been deported in the morning. When she asked where, she received an email saying, \"South Sudan.\"",

      "An undocumented immigrant who resides in Florida is facing a more than $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the country after receiving a removal order 20 years ago, CBS News has learned.",
      "According to the notice sent May 9 by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's civil fines department and provided to CBS News, the 41-year-old Florida woman and mother of three, who CBS News has chosen not to name, was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the U.S. since the removal order was issued in April 2005, running up a total of $1,821,350.",
      "In a May 20 statement provided to CBS News in response to the fine, an ICE spokesperson said that undocumented immigrants \"who violate the nation's immigration laws and fail to comply with a removal order issued by a Department of Justice Immigration Judge will face legal consequences, such as fines or imprisonment. The best option is to comply with the law and leave the United States.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson also encouraged undocumented immigrants \"to use the CBP Home app to self-deport.\"",
      "This case represents an enforcement of the civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which also requires undocumented immigrants to register with the U.S. government, according to Michelle Sanchez, the Florida-based immigration attorney representing the Honduran immigrant.",
      "In February, the Trump administration announced its plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under that immigration act. It encompasses a range of regulations but has historically rarely been enforced since its implementation.",
      "According to Sanchez, the removal order was issued after the woman failed to show up to a court hearing in 2005.",
      "In 2024, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen her client's case and have the removal order lifted, arguing the Honduran woman was eligible to apply for U.S. residency because she had resided in the U.S. for more than 10 years with no criminal record.",
      "Sanchez said her client is also a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.",
      "Under the Biden administration, ICE attorneys were given discretion to reopen cases to lift removal orders. Hundreds of thousands of these requests were left pending, however, according to Sanchez. In March, ICE notified the Florida immigration lawyer they could not reopen her client's case because the Trump administration did not offer guidance on such prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Sanchez told CBS News she has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to her clients who remain in the country illegally, but the million dollar civil fine marks a first.",
      "\"ICE is terrorizing individuals without even having to go pick them up,\" Sanchez said. \"They are terrorizing them by sending these notices where they are fining individuals an exorbitant amount of money that a person sometimes doesn't even make that amount in their lifetime.\"",
      "The notice sent to the Florida mother of three indicates that the fine can be contested, and that requesting a personal interview to do so is an option.",
      "\"They're going into the lion's den,\" Sanchez said, adding that anyone who receives such a notice should first reach out to their immigration lawyer before showing up in person to contest fines.",
      "Sanchez indicates she will be appealing her client's fine as the Honduran mother was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. once the removal order was issued.",

      "The Navy is disciplining at least two members of SEAL Team 4 after racist memes, including one depicting slavery, were shared in a Signal chat to a Black fellow SEAL, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "The memes were initially shared several years ago, but resurfaced recently after the Black sailor who was targeted reported them. The SEAL who reported the memes, citing racism and bullying, previously had his Trident \u2014 which is given to SEALs \u2014 revoked, but the Navy has since reinstated it, the sources said.",
      "The memes were developed by two enlisted SEALs based in Virginia who now face non-judicial punishment and punitive letters in their files, The Associated Press reported. Both actions can be career-ending, or can result in demotions or loss of pay.",
      "Platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions, including disciplinary letters in their files, after a probe found they did not adequately address the sailor's concerns about racist behavior and that the decision to revoke his qualifications was flawed, according to The AP.",
      "\"This was a very shocking case of explicit and repeated racist memes directed at our client in a platoon-wide text thread,\" the sailor's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, told The AP. \"They modified his face in photos to look like a monkey and portrayed him as a chained slave on a slave ship, among others.\"",
      "Parlatore praised Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, head of Naval Special Warfare, and his staff for taking swift action to \"investigate, reverse the negative repercussions that our client received, and move to hold people accountable.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Naval Special Warfare Command told CBS News on Tuesday that the Navy \"investigated serious allegations of unprofessional conduct within one of our commands\" and \"accountability actions are ongoing.\"",
      "\"We are dedicated to fostering a climate of dignity and respect, and after conducting a thorough and fair investigation, we will hold anyone found responsible of misconduct accountable,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "A defense official told The AP that the sailor filed more than a dozen specific complaints about racist behavior and about half were substantiated. As leaders began to look into the complaints, a second sailor \u2014 who is White \u2014 also complained about bullying by other platoon members. That amplified the broader concerns about the command climate and the later findings of leadership failures.",
      "This is the latest significant investigation into behavior issues and command failures at Naval Special Warfare Command. And it underscores racial concerns that are not new to the special warfare leaders.",
      "Commando forces across the services \u2014 particularly the officers \u2014 tend to be far less diverse than the military as a whole. Leaders in recent years have tried to attract a wider array of recruits in order to develop a more diverse force.",
      "Those efforts, however, could be threatened now, as the Trump administration and Defense Department leaders have made it a priority to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the military and the government as a whole.",
      "As of March 2021, a full 95% of all SEAL and combatant-craft crew officers were White and just 2% were Black, according to Naval Special Warfare statistics provided to The AP. The enlisted ranks were only slightly more diverse.",
      "Those numbers are starkly different from the overall Navy population, where about 40% of the enlisted force and 24% of its officers are non-White.",
      "Acting Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told CBS News: \"Secretary [Pete] Hegseth's work to rid the Department of Defense from the previous administration's divisive DEI agenda is vital to ensuring that racism has no place in our Armed Forces. Giving our service members preferential treatment on the basis of race \u2014in violation of federal law \u2014is the very definition of racism. Secretary Hegseth is refocusing our military on merit and putting ability before immutable characteristics again.\"",
      "Other recent investigations also found training and command problems.",
      "Last October, a highly critical review by the Navy found that two Navy SEALs drowned as they tried to climb aboard a ship carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen because of glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters.",
      "And in 2023, a Navy investigation into the death of a SEAL candidate a year earlier concluded that the training program was plagued by widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs that have increased the risk of injury and death to those seeking to become elite commandos.",

      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "Khalil, a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. permanent residency \u2014 also known as a\u00a0green card\u00a0\u2014  \u00a0was a vocal member of the student-led protests at Columbia against the war in Gaza. Khalil has not been accused of any crimes, but the Trump administration has argued he should be deported on the grounds that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has determined his presence in the U.S. and protest activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" The administration has also accused Khalil of immigration fraud. His lawyers dispute both claims.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that the administration could\u00a0continue its effort to deport Khalil, saying she did not have the authority to dispute Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law.

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden\u200b has been diagnosed with an advanced stage of prostate cancer\u200b that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones.",
    "story": [
      "Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis\u00a0with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones prompted an outpouring of concern and questions about his condition. Those questions include how long the cancer may have taken to develop and whether he was screened for it during earlier checkups.",
      "A spokesperson said Biden first learned of his diagnosis late last week. \"Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear exactly how long the cancer may have been growing, its rapid spread is attributed to it being an aggressive form of the disease. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. The Gleason score is a system for grading the severity of prostate cancer based on analysis of cell samples under a microscope.",
      "When prostate cancer is more advanced and spreads, the bones are among the areas most likely to be affected. It\u00a0can also commonly spread to the lymph nodes, liver or lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Unfortunately, late-stage cancer diagnoses are not uncommon. A 2014 analysis from Cancer Research UK, for example, found that 46% of all cancers\u00a0in that country were diagnosed at an advanced stage. A\u00a02023 study published in the journal Lancet Oncology found disruptions in care amid the pandemic also led to an increase in late-stage diagnoses across nearly all cancer types, including prostate.",
      "Slower-growing cancers can take years to develop and be detected, while more aggressive ones can become apparent more rapidly and also spread to other parts of the body quicker.",
      "Biden, who is now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, in February 2024, according to records released at the time. His spokesperson said Tuesday that Biden's last known prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test \u2014 a blood test which is used to screen for prostate cancer \u2014 was in 2014.",
      "Experts say this is likely due to that fact that these screenings are\u00a0not routinely recommended\u00a0for men 70 years or older.",
      "\"Doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, because after that, the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing, and so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you \u2014 you're talking about risk versus benefit. It may not be worth the risk,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, explained on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Instead, Biden's diagnosis came after he recently saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms. A small nodule was found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week.",
      "\"Urinary symptoms are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate,\" Gounder said. In this case, however, the testing discovered cancer.",
      "Gounder said the situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.",
      "\"He had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look,\" she said.",
      "There have been advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer, and Gounder said the treatment goal in a case like this would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life. Biden's type of cancer is hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to a testosterone-blocking treatment, Gounder said, adding that this might be combined with other medications or chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",
      "Back in 2019, Biden was diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate, or BPH. That December, his campaign released his medical evaluation, which noted: \"This patient has been treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This was initially treated with medication and was then definitively treated with surgery. He has never had prostate cancer.\"",
      "BPH is very common in older men, with around 80% of men over 70 having it, according to Yale Medicine.",
      "How do doctors screen for prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer testing typically involves two methods: a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test and a digital rectal exam, or DRE. A PSA test is a type of blood test that can indicate a higher chance of prostate cancer but is not a definitive diagnosis. A DRE involves a doctor using a gloved finger to feel for any bumps on the prostate via the rectum.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 17:06:40 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system like Israel's Iron Dome.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

    "story": [
      "Steep cuts to federal medical research grants this year have now disrupted millions in awards once backed by former President Joe Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative, after the Trump administration froze funding to Columbia University and Harvard University over their handling of campus protests about the war in Gaza.",
      "Biden revealed Sunday he has been diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. His \"Moonshot\" initiative was already personal because his son Beau died of brain cancer.",
      "Multiple cancer scientists at Harvard University say they have seen their National Institutes of Health funding evaporate in recent weeks due to the funding freeze.",
      "\"We are not allowed to charge anything on these grants and I understand that Harvard hasn't been reimbursed for any charges to these grants for at least 30 days,\" Joan Brugge, professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Brugge said the university had informed her that her research into mutations linked to breast cancer, as well as studying the recurrence of ovarian cancer, was among some 350 federal grants terminated at Harvard Medical School.",
      "Harvard bioengineering professor David Mooney said all cancer research funding from NIH's National Cancer Institute for his team had also been cut off, including multiple grants to post-doctoral research fellows.",
      "The Trump administration also terminated millions awarded for developing anti-cancer immunity at the university's immuno-engineering center, which was launched in 2020 as part of the \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative. Mooney's lab was the first to engineer an \"implantable biomaterial cancer vaccine\" to retrain the immune system to destroy cancer cells, the university says.",
      "\"This will dramatically diminish our ability to make progress in developing cancer immunotherapies,\" Mooney said in an email.",
      "Under versions of the cancer initiative launched by Biden first as vice president in 2016\u00a0\u2014 and later rebooted in 2022 after he was elected president \u2014 the federal government poured more than $1 billion into a broad array of research, prevention and treatment projects.",
      "That money came largely from the 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress in 2016, which went to more than 100 different institutions. It included millions awarded to support the work of cancer centers around the country.",
      "That also included a long-running award to support the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Now federal records show the award to support Columbia's cancer center has also been terminated.",
      "\"Anti-Semitism \u2014 like racism \u2014 is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0said in a March statement, announcing plans to look for cuts to Columbia's funding.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted universities for their handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, alleging they let antisemitism go unchecked, which the universities dispute.",
      "NIH records show the money at Columbia's cancer center had gone to a broad array of projects, ranging from clinical studies to administrative costs.",
      "Beyond the Trump administration's cuts to Columbia and Harvard, one other award directly linked to the Biden cancer initiative is also listed as terminated: a project funded at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to \"address cancer disparities among Indigenous sexual and gender minority populations\" with films, outreach and illustrations.",
      "Other projects funded by NIH's National Cancer Institute have also had their funding canceled after officials deemed they ran afoul of other White House executive orders that took aim at topics like \"gender ideology extremism\" and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programs.",
      "Support and communications staff at the cancer institute were also not spared in Kennedy and DOGE's layoffs earlier this year.",
      "Senate Democrats have criticized Kennedy and President Trump for cuts to NIH's grants this year, which they said in a report amounts to at least $15.1 million in cancer funding lost.",

      "A new study casts doubt on a phenomenon that was previously believed to show water flowing on the surface of Mars.",
      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",
      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",

      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided.

      "Sundar Pichai, CEO of both Google and parent company,Alphabet,\u00a0said in remarks at the conference that AI Mode represents a \"total reimagining of Search\" and that it would gradually be rolled out to all Google users.",
      "\"What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's \u00a0headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as it instantaneously generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature which will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed. As an example, Google's\u00a0teaser\u00a0shows a person recording video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine out loud what they can do to make it stronger. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds.",

    "summary": "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" aims to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But it has been criticized by China as threatening to increase the risks of militarizing space and a global arms race.",
      "The president on Tuesday said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how will it work?",
      "The Golden Dome is a multilayered defense system that the president, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said will deploy \"next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his term ends.",
      "The concept includes both ground- and space-based capabilities that would defend against missiles by: detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described a domain awareness layer to track threats and then two other layers, \"the first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time,\" Karako said.",
      "The new initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X it is ready to support the dome mission, describes it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company says.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles, as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators on Tuesday at a hearing. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's joint address to Congress in March, when he asked for funding for it. He said, \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too.\"",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country urges the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" she said at a Wednesday briefing in Beijing, according to news agencies. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "She also said the Golden Dome plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "When asked about China's response in an interview on \"Fox & Friends First,\" Lockheed Martin's St. John said, \"What we've seen historically is that the thing that leads to conflict is the lack of deterrence, and so our belief, along with the administration, is that having strong deterrence is the best way to deter conflict.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has been rapidly developing missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a statement earlier this month that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative is \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia, countries that the last two administrations in their national defense strategies have pointed to as strategic competitors.",

      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",

      "Target shares fell 5.7% to $92.50 in afternoon trade.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",

      "\"Businesses expect growth in consumer demand to slow and view the outlook as unusually uncertain, so they are pausing hiring,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Some retailers are benefiting from the current environment as some consumers tighten their belts. Discount giant TJX Companies, whose brands include HomeGoods, Marshall's and TJ Maxx, on Wednesday reported a 5% rise in net sales for its fiscal 2026 first quarter from a year ago.",
      "Tax bill overhang",
      "Investors are also assessing how a Republican-backed tax and spending bill\u00a0now being negotiated in the House could impact the nation's finances. Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump and the South African president clashed over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Rampahosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Rampahosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans. The president said the images show burial sites of White farmers.",
      "After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "story": [
      "The New Orleans jailbreak\u00a0sparked a massive manhunt for the 10 inmates who escaped from custody. More than 200 law enforcement officers from federal, state and local agencies are involved in the effort to capture the inmates, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail.",
      "How many of the New Orleans inmates are still at large?",
      "As of Wednesday, five inmates were still on the run and five have been captured.",
      "Leading up to the jailbreak, one of the inmates who escaped, 32-year-old Antoine Massey, allegedly told a maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, to shut off the water for a cell, according to court documents. Williams told investigators with the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation that Massey threatened to shank him if he didn't turn off the water, according to an affidavit for a warrant for Williams' arrest.",
      "According to the affidavit, Williams admitted to shutting off the water. He was arrested Monday, May 19, and charged with two felonies, 10 counts of principal to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office, authorities said.",
      "Two other people were arrested and accused of helping some of the 10 inmates who escaped, the Louisiana State Police announced on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "Timeline of the New Orleans jailbreak",
      "Here's a rundown of how the inmates escaped from the jail and the ongoing search:",
      "At 10:30 p.m. CDT on Thursday, May 15, the night before the escape, the jail was placed on lockdown, according to the sheriff's office. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson later told reporters her agency has been asking local officials for years for millions of dollars in funding to upgrade faulty locks on cell doors.",
      "In the early predawn hours of Friday, May 16, no sheriff's deputy was assigned to the part of the jail where the escaped inmates were incarcerated, and a civilian worker monitoring the area had briefly stepped away to get food, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "At around 12:22 a.m., a surveillance camera captured several inmates out of their cells forcing open another cell's sliding door, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "By about 12:43 a.m., multiple inmates had entered the cell they were trying to access, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "Inside the cell, the inmates removed a combination sink-toilet from the wall of the cell and created a hole in the wall, according to the affidavit. They were able to saw steel bars behind the cell's sink, per the affidavit.",
      "\"With the water being turned off, the inmates were able to successfully make good on their escapes,\" Louisiana Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Michael Moore wrote in the affidavit. \"If the inmates removed the sink in the cell and disconnected the rest of the plumbing with the water still on, the plan to escape would not have been successful and potentially flooded the cell, drawing attention to their actions.\"",
      "At around 1 a.m., another surveillance camera captured the inmates fleeing the building through a loading dock, according to the sheriff's office. The group then went down a perimeter road toward a new part of the facility that's under construction.",
      "At about 1:19 a.m., the inmates were seen climbing a fence separating the jail from the construction site, according to the sheriff's office. The inmates used blankets to protect themselves from the barbed wire on the fence. A traffic camera captured the inmates dashing across Interstate 10 and entering a nearby neighborhood. Sheriff's office investigators found discarded clothing in the neighborhood that's believed to have belonged to the inmates.",
      "At 8:30 a.m., the inmates' disappearance was discovered during a routine head count, and the jail's leadership was told of the escape at 8:35 a.m., according to the sheriff's office. The alarm spurred jail staff to search the facility as investigators looked through surveillance video footage.",
      "Shortly before 10 a.m., surveillance footage from a nonprofit crime camera organization captured inmate Kendell Myles, 20, on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' popular French Quarter area, according to CBS affiliate WWL-TV.",
      "Authorities captured Myles at around 11:30 a.m., according to WWL-TV. The Louisiana State Police said troopers spotted him in the French Quarter and chased him on foot. According to the sheriff's office, he was found hiding under a car at a hotel parking garage.",
      "At about 7:32 p.m., another inmate, 21-year-old Robert Moody, was captured in another part of the city after a tip was given to the nonprofit organization Crimestoppers, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "At 9:36 p.m., the sheriff's office posted to social media that a third inmate, Dkenan Dennis, 24, was apprehended in a different area of the city.",
      "On Monday, May 19, at 6:56 p.m., the Louisiana State Police posted to Facebook that a fourth inmate, 21-year-old Gary Price, was taken into custody. The agency later said he was captured in the New Orleans East area of the city.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",
      "The officials, however, declined to confirm the final destination of the flight or any formal arrangement with South Sudan's government, citing operational and safety concerns. The officials also said they could not disclose the exact whereabouts of the detainees.",

      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",

      "Mr. Trump met Tuesday morning with House Republicans as leaders ramp up their efforts to push the bill over its last hurdle in the Rules Committee before it can get to the House floor for a vote.",
      "The president put pressure on members to fall in line Tuesday as the party's dueling factions have threatened to upend the plan with demands that will be difficult to reconcile. When he arrived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump suggested that any GOP member who doesn't back what he and Republicans have deemed the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be \"knocked out so fast,\" a warning to a handful of \"grandstanders.\"",
      "\"It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, can only afford three defections in a floor vote, if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.",
      "\"I would say that if the vote were held right now, it dies a painful death,\" Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday evening. He told reporters he would vote \"no\" on the package in its current form.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ahead of the second meeting with the president, \"we're going to move forward with the vote later on.\"",
      "\"We've got to keep the bill moving,\" he said. \"Because there's a lot more steps in the process. The Senate, of course, has to go and do their work.\"",
      "But before a floor vote, the legislation will have to make it through the Rules Committee, the last stop for most legislation before the full House\u00a0votes on a measure. The committee began meeting shortly after 1 a.m., and was still meeting into the afternoon on Wednesday.",
      "\"If you guys think this ugly bill is so damn beautiful, like Trump keeps saying, you should have the courage to debate it in primetime,\" Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said at the start of the meeting.",
      "Republicans, however, rejected the request to adjourn the meeting until daylight hours. And the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said the Rules Committee \"has a long tradition of meeting late into the evening and reporting legislation long after most of America has gone to bed.\"",
      "The committee's rare overnight meeting took place as Republican leadership races to pass the budget package before its self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with the different factions in recent days to hear the demands and build a consensus around a modified version of the legislation that was produced by nearly a dozen House committees.",
      "Conservatives, who are upset that that bill does not make steep enough spending cuts to significantly bring down the deficit, have pushed for Medicaid work requirements to kick in much sooner than a 2029 deadline. They also want to eliminate all the clean energy subsidies that were implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After right-wing opposition appeared to remain firm overnight, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that the White House offered a proposal that would enable these holdouts to back the budget bill, if it were to be included in the package.",
      "\"I don't think it can be done today,\" Harris said. \"I think that there is a pathway forward that we can see.\"",
      "The conservative holdouts did not offer details on the proposal they said the White House has offered. But the caucus was set to meet with Mr. Trump Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by Johnson, CBS News confirmed.",
      "Conservatives have also been pushing to change the rate by which the federal government pays states for Medicaid, a point of contention with moderates, who have warned against larger cuts to the program.",
      "Johnson reiterated earlier this week that the change has \"been off the table for quite some time,\" however. And Mr. Trump said ahead of the meeting Tuesday morning that \"we're not doing anything cutting of anything meaningful,\" adding that on Medicaid, \"the only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Though a manager's amendment, which will include the changes negotiated to the package in recent days, has yet to be released, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the original version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. And a new preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found it would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion.",
      "Right-wing Republicans aren't the only ones with objections to the legislation, though. Blue-state Republicans oppose a provision on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and they have threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met.",
      "Prior to the SALT deduction cap, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits\u00a0wealthy homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But others also point out that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Republicans who represent blue states have pushed for an increase to the SALT cap, but balked at the $30,000 cap outlined in the package because they think that's still too low.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said ahead of the meeting with the president on Tuesday that the group of moderates had no plans to cave. And on his message to conservatives, Lawler told reporters, \"if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.\"",
      "\"The fact is, we wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine who won,\" Lawler said.",
      "Mr. Trump also weighed in on the SALT issue, suggesting that he opposes raising the cap because he claimed Democratic governors from states like New York, Illinois and California would benefit, calling them the \"biggest\" beneficiaries. But after the group of moderates met with the speaker Tuesday evening, Johnson indicated that they had \"found a point of compromise.\"",
      "According to a senior White House official, Mr. Trump told the House GOP conference during the meeting that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse, along with cutting benefits for noncitizens and imposing work requirements. The official said Mr. Trump also made clear he wants every Republican to vote \"yes\" on the bill, while saying he's losing patience with the remaining holdouts.",
      "Johnson said at a news conference following the meeting that leadership would work to \"gather up the small subgroups in the House Republican conference and tie up the remaining loose ends.\"",

      "Wisconsin Historical Society Maritime Archaeologist Tamara Thomsen said that the society confirmed that Christopher Thuss found the wreck of the J.C. Ames. Thuss was fishing in Lake Michigan off the city of Manitowoc in foggy conditions on Tuesday when he noticed the wreckage in nine feet of water off a breakwater, she said in a message to The Associated Press.",
      "The society said that according to the book \"Green Bay Workhorses: The Nau Tug Line,\" the Rand and Burger shipbuilding company in Manitowoc built the J.C. Ames in 1881 to help move lumber. The tug was one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, with a 670-horsepower engine.",
      "The tug served multiple purposes beyond moving lumber, including transporting railway cars. It eventually fell into disrepair and was scuttled in 1923, as was the practice then when ships outlived their usefulness, Thomsen said.",
      "The ship had been buried in the sand at the bottom of the lake for decades before storms this winter apparently revealed it, Thomsen said. A lack of quagga mussels attached to the ship indicates it was only recently exposed, she said.",
      "Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks and downed planes in the Great Lakes before quagga mussels destroy them. Quagga have become the dominant invasive species in the lower lakes over the last 30 years, attaching themselves to wooden shipwrecks and sunken aircraft in layers so thick they eventually crush the wreckage.",
      "\"These kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface. It sat there for over a hundred years and then came back on our radar completely by chance,\" Thomsen said in a statement. \"We are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to.\"",
      "In September, maritime historians Brendon Baillod and Bob Jaeck announced they had discovered the wreck of the John Evenson, a towing tug was lost in June 1895 while assisting a freighter as it was entering the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal in Lake Michigan. The two historians also found the schooner\u00a0Margaret A. Muir in June 2024.",

      "The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to \"years of micromanagement\" of local departments.",
      "The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and Breonna Taylor in a Louisville police shooting in 2020.",
      "\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division's failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees.\"",
      "In addition to taking steps to dismiss the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, the Trump administration also said it is closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration said it is retracting the Biden administration's findings of unconstitutional violations by all of the eight named departments, and is looking into potentially dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees across the country.",
      "The Justice Department's decision to drop the lawsuits against the Louisville and Minneapolis departments comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted in state court\u00a0on murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's killing and went on to plead guilty in a federal civil rights case.",
      "In a filing with the federal court in Minnesota in the case against the city of Minneapolis, Justice Department lawyers said that the government \"will no longer prosecute this matter.\"",
      "\"After an extensive review by current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division leadership, the United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,\" the filing, signed by Dhillon and others, reads.",
      "Consent decrees were used in federal investigations of law enforcement agencies during the Obama administration as part of a renewed commitment to civil rights issues and accountability in policing. But the Justice Department during the first Trump administration restricted their use. That policy was rescinded during the Biden administration. Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland subsequently opened the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.",
      "Dhillon, the assistant attorney general, told reporters that consent decrees often set \"unrealistic, idealistic expectations that are simply a recipe for non-compliance and perpetual consent decree hell for jurisdictions.\" But she said if there was a \"case of widespread, systemic racist or otherwise excessive-force situations happening despite training, despite litigation, despite local law enforcement taking these issues on,\" consent decrees \"might be an appropriate vehicle.\"",
      "\"Theoretically, we are not ruling it out,\" she added.",
      "The yearslong examination by the Justice Department into the Minneapolis Police Department was launched in 2021, in the wake of Floyd's death, and found that the Minneapolis Police Department disproportionately targeted Black and Native American people in law enforcement activity and used unjustified force in many instances.",
      "The probe was undertaken to determine whether the department engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional or unlawful policing. That civil investigation was separate from a federal criminal probe into Floyd's death, which led to convictions of three Minneapolis police officers who were found to have failed to step in to stop Chauvin's use of force against Floyd.",
      "Investigators had recommended nearly 30 remedial measures and improvements for Minneapolis to implement to combat racial disparities and excessive use of force by the department, such as enhanced training and accountability measures, and improved data collection of police activity.",
      "The city of Minneapolis and the Justice Department had entered into an agreement in principle to reach a court-authorized consent decree, which would have formalized the federal findings and recommendations, and appointed an independent monitor for the police department.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey approved the terms of a court-enforceable consent decree in early January, which had to be approved by a federal judge before taking effect. The city has begun implementing the reforms laid out in the agreement and said it will continue to do so despite the Trump administration's decision to dismiss the consent decree case.",
      "\"We're doing it anyway,\" Frey said in a statement. \"We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree\u2014because accountability isn't optional. Our independent monitor has lauded the meaningful progress we've made under the state settlement agreement, and the public can count on clear, measurable proof that our reforms are moving forward.\"",
      "As for the Louisville Police Department, the Justice Department's investigation found that it, too, likely engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated citizens' civil and constitutional rights. The Justice Department, city of Louisville and its police department reached an agreement in principle toward a consent decree.",
      "Four Louisville Metro Police Department officers faced federal charges in connection with Taylor's death in March 2020. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot when officers stormed into her apartment while she was asleep with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who thought the officers were intruders, fired a handgun as they entered. The officers in response fired 22 shots into the apartment, and one struck Taylor in the chest.",
      "But in announcing the decision to dismiss the lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, the Justice Department under President Trump claimed they accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by \"wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data.\"",
      "The Trump administration also said the consent decrees went too far and would have subjected the police departments to sweeping oversight.",
      "\"In short, these sweeping consent decrees would have imposed years of micromanagement of local police departments by federal courts and expensive independent monitors, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of compliance costs, without a legally or factually adequate basis for doing so,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Dhillon said the agreements cost an average of $10 million a year and \"should be a rare exception and not the norm.\" She said \"specifics of policing, policy, hiring, training, management, promotion and internal policies are best made at a local level, where there's local accountability, and local control over funding and policy issues.\"",
      "Both Minneapolis and Louisville either already have consent decrees at the state level or are hiring their own monitors and taking actions on their own to ensure constitutional policing, Dhillon said, adding that the cities should save money thanks to the Justice Department's decision.",
      "\"You can actually use that money, tens of millions of dollars, to hire more cops for your communities that will keep you safer than a partner at a big law firm in D.C. getting paid to monitor you,\" Dhillon said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:32:38 -0400",
    "summary": "The FDA is requiring COVID vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna to update their warnings about the possible risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Spikevax and Comirnaty should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "St. Louis' emergency management chief has been placed on administrative leave, the city's mayor said, after sirens meant to sound during a tornado warning failed to be activated ahead of Friday's deadly twister.",
      "Sarah Russell, commissioner of the City Emergency Management Agency in St. Louis, will remain on paid administrative leave as an external investigation proceeds into what went wrong.",
      "St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer already ordered an internal probe in the immediate aftermath of the siren failure, when National Weather Service radar indicated that a tornado touched down between 2:30 and 2:50 p.m. local time. It initially struck near central St. Louis before ripping through the area, with officials estimating some 5,000 people were affected.",
      "Five people in St. Louis were killed in the severe weather, officials said. Spencer described it as \"one of the worst storms \u2014 absolutely.\"",
      "There is a system of 60 outdoor sirens stationed around St. Louis, which are meant to be activated once the National Weather Service issues a tornado warning for the area as it did on Friday. There are two places where they can be activated: the CEMA office and the Fire Department.",
      "According to Spencer's office, which announced Russell's leave Tuesday, the commissioner was attending an offsite workshop with other emergency management staff when the tornado warning came down, and that prevented them from activating the sirens from their agency's main building, about a half mile away.",
      "Russell instead contacted the Fire Department to activate the sirens, but the directive was ambiguous, the mayor said. Her office released the recording of Russell's call to the department, in which she confirms they are aware of the NWS warning and briefly clarifies the timing of it before saying, \"OK, you got the sirens?\" The person at the fire department replies \"Yes, ma'am,\" and the call ends.",
      "\"The direction was not clear,\" Spencer said at a news conference Wednesday morning about the phone call. Russel did not clearly direct the person at the Fire Department to press the button to activate the sirens, she said, adding, \"It's my understanding that the button was not pushed.\"",
      "However, even if someone had pressed the button at the Fire Department, city officials learned Tuesday that the button was not working.",
      "\"Work to repair the button began Tuesday afternoon and is expected to be completed within days,\" Spencer's office said.",
      "The button at the CEMA office was functioning, and Fire Department personnel will be stationed there 24/7 to activate the sirens if needed, the office said.",
      "Spencer also signed an executive order Tuesday to change the siren activation protocol, putting the Fire Department solely in charge of activating the warning system. While the standard operating procedure for activating the sirens says the primary activation point is located at the Fire Department headquarters, the de facto protocol had been that CEMA would activate the system at its office and contact the Fire Department if it could not.",
      "\"With the mayor's executive order, this lack of clarity has now been eliminated,\" Spencer's office said.",
      "Until a permanent replacement for Russell is found, St. Louis fire captain John Walk will serve as the interim emergency management commissioner.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district judge ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group that filed a FOIA request for its records.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to halt a lower court order that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group in a lawsuit that tests whether the task force is subject to the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The request from Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose out of a public records request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Amy Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including to depose Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "\"Canceling any government contract would seem to require substantial authority \u2014 and canceling them on this scale certainly does. Again, USDS reportedly is leading the charge on these actions, not merely advising others to carry them out,\" Cooper wrote in a March decision.",
      "He noted that DOGE likely has some independent authority to terminate federal employees, programs and contracts.",
      "\"Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does,\" Cooper said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the federal appeals court in Washington to halt the order, which it agreed to do temporarily. Then, last week, a panel of judges on the appeals court lifted its stay, which clears the way for DOGE to hand over the documents sought by CREW. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that the discovery ordered by the district court is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "DOGE now has until June 3 to turn over documents, and Gleason's deposition must be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute over the efforts to learn more about DOGE, its work and employees turns on whether the task force is subject to FOIA, the federal law that allows members of the public to request access to records and information from federal agencies. FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal courts and entities within the Executive Office of the President.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President tasked with providing recommendations to Mr. Trump and federal agencies on policy matters that are important to the president's agenda. Sauer said that as a result of those functions, DOGE is exempt from FOIA.",
      "Sauer claimed that the district court's order requiring DOGE to hand over information through the discovery process to determine if it is covered by FOIA turns the public records law \"on its head\" and violates the separation of powers by subjecting it to \"intrusive discovery.\"",
      "He warned that if it is allowed to stand, several components of the White House like the offices of the chief of staff, national security adviser, and other advisers to the president would be subject to FOIA.",
      "\"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations \u2014 threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE when he returned White House as part of an effort to shrink the size of the federal government. The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have said in court filings that he is not an employee of the entity and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE eventually led the White House to declare Gleason as its acting administrator. Gleason worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",
      "Still, since its establishment, DOGE employees have fanned out across federal agencies to implement cost-cutting measures and were behind steep reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of DOGE's efforts, as well as Musk's role within the task force have been subject to legal challenges.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently weighing an emergency appeal involving DOGE's attempts to gain access to sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration and was asked to intervene in a legal battle over reductions in force at 21 agencies.",

      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",
      "The CDC's recommendations directly impact which vaccinations health insurers are required to cover under the law.",

      "\"It is with immense sadness that we share that our devoted and loving father, husband, brother, friend, and public servant, Congressman Gerald E. Connolly, passed away peacefully at his home this morning surrounded by family,\" Connolly's family announced in a statement.",
      "Connolly, a Democrat, has represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of the region outside of Washington, D.C., since 2009. He announced in November that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
      "But the Virginia Democrat said in an open letter to his constituents last month that while the cancer was initially beaten back after treatments, it had returned. He said at the time that his \"sun is setting on my time in public service.\"",
      "In announcing his death, Connolly's family praised his years in public service, saying \"his legacy now colors our region.\"",
      "\"We were fortunate to share Gerry with Northern Virginia for nearly 40 years because that was his joy, his purpose, and his passion,\" they said. \"His absence will leave a hole in our hearts, but we are proud that his life's work will endure for future generations. We thank you for your love of Gerry, and know he loved you all so much.\"",
      "Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chaired the Oversight Committee, honored Connolly in a statement.",
      "\"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Ranking Member Gerry Connolly. He was a dedicated public servant who represented Virginia's 11th Congressional District with honor and integrity,\" he said. \"We mourn the loss of our friend and colleague, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.\"",
      "Before he was elected to Congress, Connolly served for 14 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, including five years as its chairman. The county is the largest jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C., region, with more than 1 million residents. While in Congress, he served on the Oversight panel and the Foreign Affairs Committee.",

    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 07:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",

    "summary": "Immigration lawyers said they've been informed the U.S. may have deported migrants from Southeast Asian countries to South Sudan.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration lawyers told a federal judge on Tuesday that they received information indicating the U.S. government may have put migrants from countries like Myanmar and Vietnam on a deportation flight to South Sudan, an eastern African nation plagued by conflict and political instability.",
      "In an emergency filing to the federal district court in Massachusetts, the attorneys said the reported deportation flight to South Sudan would directly violate a ruling issued by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy that barred the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without affording them certain due process rights.",
      "The lawyers said any migrant deported to South Sudan \"faces a strong likelihood of irreparable harm,\" citing reports documenting widespread violence, human rights violations and conflict in the landlocked African country, the world's youngest nation.",
      "Soon after its independence in 2011, South Sudan endured a bloody civil war \u2014 and fears of a new conflict have recently surfaced. The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for South Sudan, warning Americans not to travel there due to \"crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "The emergency motion asked Murphy to prohibit deportations of third-country deportees to South Sudan, and to order the return of those deported there, if the removals had already occurred.",
      "Late on Tuesday, Murphy ordered the Trump administration to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants reportedly being sent to South Sudan or another third country, to ensure they can return to the U.S. if he finds their deportation to be unlawful. He instructed government lawyers to be ready to provide certain information during a hearing scheduled for Wednesday, including the names of the deportees and details on what level of due process they received.",
      "The U.S. government has not publicly confirmed an arrangement to deport migrants who are not from South Sudan to that country. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has been mounting an aggressive diplomatic campaign to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching far-flung nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees. It has already deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees to El Salvador.",
      "Earlier this month, CBS News and other outlets reported the administration had made plans to send migrants to Libya, but that flight never materialized once those reports surfaced.",
      "In April, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, barred the government from deporting migrants to third countries, unless it first provided them and their lawyers notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation.",
      "In their filing on Tuesday, the group of immigration lawyers said the government appeared to have violated that order in the case of two migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam.",
      "Emails submitted by the lawyers show that an attorney for the man from Myanmar was sent a notice on Monday indicating that his client had been told he would be deported to South Africa. The attorney was then sent another email, indicating that his client was actually facing deportation to South Sudan, the emails show.",
      "On Tuesday morning, another lawyer helping the man from Myanmar emailed the immigration detention center in Los Fresnos, Texas, where he was being held, asking about his whereabouts. She was told her client had been deported in the morning. When she asked where, she received an email saying, \"South Sudan.\"",

      "The global consulting and technology services company predicted that electricity demand could jump at least 25% in the next five years and as much as 78% by 2050 \u2014 findings that far outpace historical trends over the past two decades. Such growth could have a significant impact on both the reliability and affordability of electricity, the report said.

    "summary": "President Trump and the South African president clashed over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Rampahosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Rampahosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans. The president said the images show burial sites of White farmers.",
      "After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",

      "\"Several persons shot him in the back and the head and then fled toward a forested area,\" Reuters quoted an unnamed source at the Spanish Interior Ministry as saying.",
      "There was no immediate confirmation of the slain man's identity by Spain's National Police or other authorities, and no indication of a motive or any suspects who might have been identified. Witnesses told Spanish media that at least one possible suspect was seen running into a nearby wooded area.",
      "According to Spain's El Diario newspaper, citing witnesses, Portnov was shot right after dropping off his children at the American School. Photos from the scene showed a man's body lying motionless on the ground behind a Mercedes sedan.",
      "Portnov was a senior aid to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, a pro-Russian leader who was ousted during the Euromaidan Revolution in 2014. That ouster brought Ukraine's current, Western-backed government to power, and it infuriated Russia, which launched its first, initial invasion of Ukrainian territory that same year, quickly culminating in the unilateral annexation of Crimea.",
      "Portnov was a lawyer, and his political opponents in Ukraine had accused him of helping build a legal framework to enable the former government in Kyiv to crack down on protesters during the 2014 pro-democracy uprising.",
      "Portnov continued living in Ukraine after the 2014 revolution, despite his close ties with the Yanukovich administration, until he left the country in 2022, according to the Radio Freedom Ukraine network.",
      "In 2021, Portnov was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Magnitsky Act, an American law designed to target foreign individuals implicated in corruption and human rights abuses.",
      "The U.S. government accused him of having \"cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine's judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery,\" and said he had been \"credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine's courts and undermining reform efforts.\"",
      "\"As of 2019, Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions,\" the Treasury said.",
      "There have been a series of crimes in Spain seemingly related to the Russia-Ukraine war since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Late that same year, a series of letter bomb attacks targeted high-profile institutions including the Ukrainian and U.S. embassies in Madrid and the Spanish Defense Ministry. In early 2024, Maxim Kuzminov, a Russian pilot who had defected to Ukraine, was killed near Alicante, in southeast Spain.",

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

      "Pope Leo XIV called Wednesday for sufficient humanitarian aid to be allowed into war-ravaged Gaza, where humanitarian agencies say a total blockade has sparked critical food and medicine shortages. Israel has, under massive pressure from the U.S. and other allies, started to allow more aid into Gaza this week, but it has not eased its military operations, and aid agencies say the amount of humanitarian goods entering the strip is nowhere near enough to meet the urgent needs of a battered civilian population.",
      "The United Nations announced Monday that it had been cleared to send in aid for the first time since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, sparking severe shortages of food and medicine.",
      "\"The situation in the Gaza Strip is worrying and painful,\" the pope said during his first weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. \"I renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid and to put an end to the hostilities, the heartbreaking price of which is paid by children, the elderly, the sick.\"",

      "Israel has vowed to carry on with its war until the hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive, are free, Hamas is defeated and disarmed and its leaders are sent into exile.

      "A soaring death toll in the Gaza Strip and an increasingly vocal outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory are piling pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas and drop his country's near-total blockade of the enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 87 people were killed by Israeli military strikes over the last 24 hours alone.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have ramped up operations in Gaza over the last week, killing hundreds of people, many of them women and children, in what Netanyahu's government insists is legitimate self-defense and aimed entirely at securing the return of 58 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and destroying the group. Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",
      "On Monday, for the first time in two and a half months, Netanyahu permitted a handful of trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza. He said he had been pressured into easing the total blockade by allies who could not tolerate \"images of mass famine.\"",
      "There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that as many as 100 trucks had been allowed to cross the Gaza border. But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",
      "As a result of that pressure, he's allowing the limited amount of aid into Gaza.",
      "Renard said the WFP had sufficient food on standby, ready to enter, to feed the entire population of Gaza for a month.",
      "\"It must stop,\" he said of the Israeli blockade. \"The civilian population shouldn't be trapped. There's no reason, actually, to hold them accountable for what they are not part of.\"",
      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",
      "In a strongly worded statement published Monday, the leaders of the U.K., France and Canada called the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable, and they threatened to take action.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank ... We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",

      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in an indictment released in 2023 that the sons of \"El Chapo\" and their cartel associates fed some of their victims \"dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.",
      "\"There's no safe place left in this city these days,\" said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\"My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,\" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \"Why do the police do nothing?\" she cried out.",
      "\"What are we doing here?\"",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\"We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'\" Zazueta said. \"We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?\"",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\"It's at least more stable,\" he said. \"Because here, today, it's just suffocating.\"",
      "Cartel violence is also frequent in the central state of Guanajuato, Mexico's most deadly state. This week, gunmen opened fire and killed seven people, including some minors, in a plaza in the city of San Felipe, police said. The violent crime is believed to be linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico.",

      "Authorities were investigating the motive and checking surveillance camera footage to identify the attackers, Brugada said.",
      "Forensic experts were seen gathering evidence at the scene of the crime on a busy avenue, as police officers stood guard. A body covered in a white sheet lay on the ground near the victims' car, whose windows were shattered.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system like Israel's Iron Dome.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats.",
      "The president also said the budget package Republicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies.",
      "Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can.",
      "\"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\"",
      "The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around.",
      "\"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\"",
      "The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In his March joint address to Congress, the president requested funding for the system.",
      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

      "On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared some of the 2,500 items from the Syrian archive relating to Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy who infiltrated the political echelon in Syria, with Cohen's widow. Sunday marked 60 years since Cohen was hanged in a square in Damascus.",
      "The items recently spirited into Israel include documents, recordings, photos, and items collected by Syrian intelligence after his capture in January 1965, letters in his own handwriting to his family in Israel, photographs of his activity during his operational mission in Syria and personal objects that were taken from his home after his capture.",
      "Among the items recovered was a handwritten will penned by Cohen hours before his execution, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "Suitcases of items brought to Israel included worn folders stuffed with handwritten notes, keys to his apartment in Damascus, passports and false identification documents, missions from the Mossad to surveil specific people and places, and documentation of all the efforts of his widow, Nadia Cohen, begging world leaders for his release from prison.",
      "A Syrian government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a Reuters news agency request for comment on how the items had been retrieved from Syria.",
      "Cohen, who was born in Egypt to a Jewish family, was sent by Mossad to Syria, where he posed as a Syrian businessman named Kamal Amin Taabet, the BBC reported.\u00a0 After befriending influential political, business and military figures, he was able to obtain secret information, which he passed back to Israel.",
      "Cohen's success in Syria was one of the Mossad spy agency's first major achievements, and the top-secret intelligence he obtained is widely credited with helping Israel prepare for its swift victory in the 1967 Middle East War.",

One week ago, he was reunited with his family in a deal brokered by the Trump administration and led by the White House's Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Alexander and his family have credited the Trump team with saving his life, and in a sit-down interview with CBS News, the young soldier's parents told senior foreign correspondent Debora Patta about the remarkable moment they learned Edan would be released, and the moments they've cherished since.",
      "Edan Alexander spent 584 days in Hamas captivity. After a number of false starts and false hope for his release, when the call finally did come from the highest levels of the U.S. government, his father missed it \u2014 eight times.",
      "\"So, we were all at home in Jersey after the Mother's Day brunch that we had,\" recalled his mother, Yael.",
      "\"I was blowing out some leaves,\" said his father, Adi. When he put down the leaf blower, he realized he had \"missed eight phone calls from Steve Witkoff.\"",
      "When Adi finally got in touch with the senior White House envoy, \"he told us in 10 minutes from now, Hamas will be announcing about your son's release tomorrow.\"",
      "\"I thanked him. Non-stop; 'Thank you, Steve! Thank you so much,'\" Yael recalled saying down the phone line. \"It's the happiest Mother's Day ever!\"",
      "\"We were like, yelling, like crazy with the kids,\" she said. As Yael, Adi and their two other children watched the television, the announcement came that Edan would be released the following day, just as Witkoff had promised. \"And we were like, okay, we need to pack! We need to... Get to Israel!\"",
      "Finally, the reunion they'd dreamt of for more than a year and a half was taking shape.",
      "Adi booked a flight immediately. Yael had already booked one for later that same day, in a sheer stroke of luck, planning to go and be with family in Israel right after marking Mother's Day.",
      "Neither of the parents got much rest on their flights to Israel.",
      "\"I couldn't sleep the whole flight,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Like, you're alert ... I couldn't sit even, you know? I was like in full adrenaline, like, ready, to be there and to get Edan back, you know?\"",
      "As soon as they touched down, they were whisked away to an Israeli military base, where Edan soon arrived after being handed over by Hamas.",
      "\"Definitely I gave him like, the biggest hug ever,\" said his mother. \"When I came to him, I came in full power! We almost fell, because he was weak, and he was very excited, like he was standing, like shivering, you know, because, wow, it's unbelievable \u2014 and I'm screaming, and I am like, you know, holding him. It was \u2014 wow.\"",
      "The parents said Edan remains weak, but doctors cleared him for release from the hospital where he's been treated. He's still getting medical attention for some minor injuries sustained during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, which his mom and dad said, \"nobody took care of in those tunnels.\"",
      "Even getting his freedom back was a harrowing ordeal.",
      "\"The day of release was a very busy day for him,\" father Adi told CBS News. \"It took forever. They moved around and crawled under, and it was a very tough day on him. He didn't sleep the whole night before that, because he was excited, he didn't sleep. He was like, super, super tired, so it took like, almost two days after for him to decompress from the day of the release.\"",
      "Since then, Edan has given them some details about his captivity, but they aren't pushing him.",
      "\"He talks a lot about it, but no rush. We're not asking. If you want to say something, you say, and we're not pushing,\" said his father. \"He went through a lot of stuff.\"",
      "\"He's just happy to be home, you know, just to sit with Mika and Roy [his siblings] and just to hang out and just be with us and watch TV yesterday,\" his parents said.",
      "During his long captivity, Edan saw his parents on the news, pleading for his release.",
      "\"I think the fact that he saw us, saw us running and fighting and knocking on every door, kept him hopeful,\" said his father, along with \"the fact that he was held with other hostages all together, and not by himself, kept him hopeful. And he's just a strong kid, you know, strong mentally and physically.\"",
      "Hamas has held many of its hostages in tunnels under the Gaza Strip, with many, including Alexander, saying they never saw daylight at all.",
      "\"I'm so pale,\" his mother recalled him saying. \"I look like a vampire!\"",
      "Israel has stepped up its war in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 53,000 people have now been killed since the fighting began, including more than 500 in the last week alone.",
      "Families of the hostages \u2014 58 of whom are still believed to be held in Gaza, including about 20 thought by Israeli officials to be alive \u2014 have taken to the streets regularly, decrying the renewed offensive as putting their loved ones at even greater risk.",
      "\"Edan told us, so when they heard the bombing, it was very, very concerning, scary,\" said Adi. \"And at some point, one of the tunnels collapsed.\"",
      "\"He told us sometimes he was afraid to go to sleep. Because maybe they are going to bomb this place that he is specifically inside,\" added the father. \"It was very scary.\"",
      "Now back together as a family, their thoughts are still very much with the other hostages.",
      "\"We are still continuing to speak for all the 58 hostages that are still there,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Whatever Edan told me about hostages [who were] with him, you know, during any time of the captivity, I'm calling their moms and dads, and I'm telling them from the hospital \u2014 I've done it already \u2014 and I am telling them whatever Edan told me. You know, to give them a little bit hope that their story could end also soon, and with a good ending.\"",
      "She knows better than most how much power that hope can provide.",
      "\"It's very important, you know. For me, every hostage that got released, it was like, 'Oh my God, maybe he saw Edan.

    "summary": "Scientists at the University of Tokyo have developed a groundbreaking AI-powered technology that can non-invasively monitor platelet activity in real time, detecting potentially deadly blood clots.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the 'Decoding Broken Hearts' initiative on 'Special Report.'",
      "AI technology could be used to detect potentially deadly blood clots before they strike.",
      "That's according to scientists at the University of Tokyo, who say they have created a non-invasive way to observe clotting activity in blood as it occurs.",
      "The new artificial intelligence tool uses a powerful microscope to monitor platelets in real time, the researchers shared in a press release from the university.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Platelets, which are tiny blood cells that help form clots to stop bleeding, play a \"crucial role\" in heart disease, particularly coronary artery disease, according to Dr. Kazutoshi Hirose, lead author of the study.",
      "If the platelet count is too high, it can increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "Scientists at the University of Tokyo have discovered a non-invasive way to observe clotting activity in blood as it occurs. (iStock)",
      "To prevent dangerous clots, patients with coronary artery disease are usually treated with anti-platelet drugs.",
      "\"However, it's still challenging to accurately evaluate how well these drugs are working in each individual, which makes monitoring platelet activity an important goal for both doctors and researchers,\" Hirose said in the press release.",
      "How the tool works",
      "Traditional methods of monitoring platelet activity often rely on indirect measurements or invasive procedures.",
      "With the AI tool, a high-powered microscope works like a \"super-high-speed camera that takes sharp pictures of blood cells in flow,\" said Yuqi Zhou, assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Tokyo, in the release.",
      "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TRANSFORMS PATIENT CARE AND REDUCES BURNOUT, PHYSICIAN SAYS",
      "\"Just like traffic cameras capture every car on the road, our microscope captures thousands of images of blood cells in motion every second,\" he said. \"We then use artificial intelligence to analyze those images.\"",

      "\"This technology stands out because it allows doctors to directly observe platelets in the bloodstream and measure how they interact and form clumps in real time,\" said Keisuke Goda, a professor at The University of Tokyo\u2019s chemistry department, in the release.",
      "\"Our studies have shown it to be highly effective in patients with coronary artery disease, the most common cause of heart attacks and one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. and the world,\" he added.",
      "Traditional methods of monitoring platelet activity often rely on indirect measurements or invasive procedures, according to the researchers. (iStock)",
      "When the researchers tested the technique on over 200 patients, they found that people with more serious heart problems had more clumping in their blood.",
      "A blood sample taken from a patient's arm and tested with the tool resulted in nearly the same results as blood taken directly from the heart's arteries, they noted.",
      "Treatment implications",
      "Harvey Castro, a Texas-based emergency physician and AI expert, described the implications as significant for patient care.",
      "\"Today, we rely on indirect lab markers or invasive cath-lab blood draws to judge clot risk,\" Castro, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"This technology turns an ordinary venous draw into live telemetry of platelet behavior, giving answers in seconds rather than hours.\"",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Typically, if doctors want to understand what's happening in the arteries, especially the coronary arteries, they need to do invasive procedures, like inserting a catheter through the wrist or groin to collect blood,\" said Hirose.",
      "In studies of the tool's effectiveness, a regular blood test from the arm showed nearly the same results as blood taken directly from the heart's arteries. (iStock)",
      "\"What we found is that just taking a regular blood sample from a vein in the arm can still provide meaningful information about platelet activity in the arteries.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said the U.S. could step away from Russia-Ukraine peace talks if they prove futile. VP Vance took it a step further by saying the U.S. is totally open to doing so.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance says the U.S. wants to see \"outcomes\" from Russia and Ukraine on peace talks and isn't afraid to step aside from its involvement in negotiating with both countries.",
      "Vice President JD Vance's suggestion this week that the U.S. could walk away from supporting Ukraine if peace talks with Russia stagnate could serve as catnip for the Kremlin, according to experts who say Russian President Vladimir Putin might choose to smother progress in hopes of getting America to wash \"its hands of the war.\"",
      "While President Donald Trump has indicated that the U.S. may disengage from the negotiations as a last resort if they prove futile, Vance has taken the rhetoric a step further by saying the U.S. is definitely open to doing so.",
      "\"We\u2019re more than open to walking away,\" Vance told reporters on board Air Force Two on Monday, just moments before a high-stakes phone call between Trump and Putin. \"The United States is not going to spin its wheels here. We want to see outcomes.\"",
      "But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautioned that no one wins if the U.S. steps aside from the talks, except for Russia.",
      "\"It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace because the only one who benefits from that is Putin,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a Monday post on X.",
      "Vance's remark about abandoning mediation between the two countries would only embolden Russia, even though a lack of U.S. involvement still wouldn't give Putin everything he wants, according to John Hardie, the deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Russia program, a nonprofit research institute based in Washington.",
      "For the moment, Moscow still benefits from U.S. involvement in the talks because the Kremlin wants the U.S. to help advance a deal that benefits Russia and alleviates sanctions, Hardie said.",
      "\"But, for the Kremlin, the United States washing its hands of the war would be the next best outcome if it means an end or reduction to U.S. support for Ukraine, especially since President Trump may well move to normalize relations with Russia anyhow,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital. \"So the administration\u2019s threat to walk away risks perversely incentivizing Kremlin intransigence. A better approach would be to ramp up the economic and military pressure on Russia if Putin continues to reject compromise.\"",
      "Russia still desires normalization with the U.S., which can only happen if the war ends swiftly and relatively amicably, said Peter Rough, a senior fellow and director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute think tank.",
      "\"That reset in relations is a giant carrot the administration is dangling in front of the Kremlin,\" Rough told Fox News Digital. \"If the U.S. walks away because Russia will not make peace, however, then that carrot disappears as well.\"",
      "Rough noted that other administration officials besides Vance, including Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have mentioned the possibility of walking away from a deal, so Vance's comments don't necessarily reflect a huge change in policy. And it's unclear right now what exactly stepping aside would mean.",
      "\"The purpose of those comments has been to impress on the Kremlin that U.S. patience is not limitless,\" Rough said.",
      "Vance hasn't shied away from issuing bold foreign policy statements since becoming vice president. From sparring with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February to appearing to counter Trump when Vance remarked in May that the war in Ukraine was far from over after Trump indicated a deal might emerge soon, Vance has been outspoken in a way most vice presidents haven't been.",
      "When asked for comment or if there were any concerns about Vance's Monday statement, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Vance\u2019s office. Vance\u2019s office declined to provide comment when asked if his remarks would encourage Russia to sit the negotiations out and continue its attacks.",

      "That boldness has carried over into the Russia-Ukraine negotiations, where Vance has taken a proactive approach, at times appearing to be forging his own path.",
      "Vance and Rubio engaged in discussions to end the conflict in Ukraine with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Rome on Sunday, among other issues. Vance and Rubio also discussed the Trump administration's efforts to end the war with Vatican prelate Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher on Monday.",
      "Aboard Air Force Two on Monday, Vance said the negotiations had reached \"a bit of [an] impasse\" between the two countries and that the conflict is not the Trump administration\u2019s war to wage but rather belongs to former President Joe Biden and Putin.",
      "\"There is fundamental mistrust between Russia and the West. It's one of the things the president thinks is, frankly, stupid, that we should be able to move beyond,\" Vance told reporters. \"The mistakes that have been made in the past, but ... that takes two to tango.\"",
      "\"I know the president's willing to do that, but if Russia's not willing to do that, then we're eventually just going to have to say ... this is not our war,\" Vance said. \"It's Joe Biden's war, it's Vladimir Putin's war. It's not our war. We're going to try to end it, but if we can't end it, we're eventually going to say, 'You know what? That was worth a try, but we're not doing it anymore.'\"",

      "Meanwhile, Trump has suggested continued U.S. involvement may not be a viable option moving forward, but he has been reticent about specifics on what would actually prompt him to walk away from the talks. For example, Trump said on May 8 in an interview with NBC News that he believes peace is possible but that the U.S. wouldn't act as a mediator forever.",
      "\"Well, there will be a time when I will say, 'OK, keep going, keep being stupid,\" Trump said in the interview.",

      "Once a missile is launched toward the U.S. homeland, the Golden Dome system aims to detect it, and orbital systems would aim to hit the missile during its \"boost\" phase, either with a laser or a kinetic interceptor. Otherwise, ground-based systems could deploy to knock it off its path.",

      "Almost 200 antisemitism complaints filed with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), either in the early evaluation stages or in later investigatory stages, were left unresolved under the Biden administration, according to the official.",
      "More than 150 of those unresolved complaints, according to the official, were filed after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed nearly 1,200 innocent people and sparked an Israeli military campaign in Gaza that led to an uptick in anti-Israel sentiment across the United States, especially on college campuses.",
      "\"The Biden administration placed an undue burden on OCR by stretching the scope of civil rights law beyond its statutory purview,\" said Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokesperson. \"The Trump OCR is cleaning that up daily. By\u00a0enforcing the law as it is written, the Trump administration\u2019s OCR is\u00a0using its personnel and resources responsibly and eliminating wasteful and unfounded investigations.\"",

      "The Trump administration also reversed the Biden administration's decision to include \"gender identity\" within the scope of Title IX and instructed educational institutions receiving federal funds to halt the continuance of what the Trump administration has called racially discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "\"[The Biden administration] expanded the sex-based protections of Title IX to include gender identity, thereby creating a whole avenue of issues, such as pronoun misgendering cases, which would be pursued by OCR investigators as possibly constituting discrimination,\" Hartman said. \"Similarly, the previous administration\u2019s OCR stretched Title VI to its breaking point by claiming DEI, which is often racially discriminatory, was consistent with Title VI, incentivizing educational institutions to double down on DEI programming and policies lest they risk meritless Title VI investigations.\"",

In March, the Education Department announced it had sent letters to 60 institutions of high education warning them of potential civil rights violations if they do not adequately protect their Jewish students as required under Title VI.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 16:07:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",
      "We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "Ways to protect yourself after the Ascension data breach",
      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.",
      "This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics.",
      "By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

      "What was learned and tested",
      "The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK.",
      "Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

These services allow you to securely store your photos, videos and documents in the cloud, freeing up valuable storage on your device. One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer.",
      "Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",

The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",
      "1. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable encryption:\u00a0Encrypt your external hard drives and cloud storage accounts to add an extra layer of protection to your data.",
      "3. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts that offer this feature, especially for cloud storage services.",
      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage. Windows supports a range of cloud storage options, including its own services like OneDrive.",

Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",

      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions.

He added that they left the ICE facility the next morning at the latest in the 10 a.m. hour and at the earliest before 9 a.m.",

      "Earlier this month, Murphy blocked the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to deport individuals from countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos to Libya. Then, Murphy had reaffirmed his injunction on third country deportations in response to an emergency motion from the migrants\u2019 lawyers."

      "\u201cThe Secretary of Defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,\" said Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. \"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "Parnell referred additional requests for information to the Air Force. NBC News reached out to Qatari officials for comment.",
      "News that Trump was considering accepting a plane from a foreign government broke before his planned visit to Qatar last week. Delays had slowed the timeline for delivery of a Boeing contract for two jets to be used as new Air Force One planes.",

      "Worth about $400 million, the plane has been called a \u201cflying palace.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, former Vice President Mike Pence suggested the move could also raise constitutional issues, and questioned whether the U.S. should place so much trust in a partner that \"has a long history of playing both sides.\"",
      "Accepting the plane, Pence said in an interview with Meet the Press, \u201cis inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs. And my hope is the president reconsiders it.\u201d",
      "Noting that there are \u201cvery real constitutional issues,\u201d Pence referenced the part of the Constitution that does not allow public officials to accept gifts from foreign governments.",
      "A refitting could cost $1 billion and take years to complete, more than twice the plane\u2019s reported value, NBC News reported.",
      "When Trump was asked about the plane during a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday, Ramaphosa interjected, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a plane to give you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wish you did,\u201d Trump responded.",

      "A Manhattan judge sentenced three men to decades in prison on Wednesday for facilitating a years-long drug-induced robbery scheme at New York City gay bars that ultimately killed two men.",
      "Jayqwan Hamilton, 37, Jacob Barroso, 32, and Robert DeMaio, 36, were found guilty in February of committing murder, robbery and conspiracy in connection with the scheme that lasted from March 2021 to June 2022. Julio Ramirez, a 25-year-old social worker, and John Umberger, a 33-year-old political consultant, were murdered in the spring of 2022 in the scheme.",
      "All three of the defendants were convicted of murdering Ramirez. Two of them, Hamilton and DeMaio, were convicted of murdering Umberger. Hamilton and Barroso spoke at the sentencing on Wednesday and maintained their innocence.",
      "Hamilton and DeMaio were sentenced to 40 years to life in prison, and Barroso was sentenced to 20 years to life.",
      "\"This was a cold and calculated pattern,\" Judge Felicia Mennin said at the Wednesday sentencing hearing. \"I pity your lack of empathy. But pity will not translate into leniency in this case.\"",
      "During the three-week trial, prosecutors said the trio worked together to drug and rob five men after meeting them outside popular city gay bars and nightclubs.",
      "The defendants drugged the victims to the point of unconsciousness \u2014 using a concoction that included fentanyl \u2014 before using their lifeless faces to gain access to their cell phones, using facial recognition technology.\u00a0Once inside the victims\u2019 cell phones, the men stole thousands of dollars out of their banking apps and used payment apps to purchase food, shoes, alcohol and other items, prosecutors said.",
      "\"I\u2019m sympathetic towards the victims and their families. However, I disagree with the verdict. I maintain my innocence,\" Hamilton said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing in New York criminal court. \"My actions weren\u2019t deadly at all, but I made some mistakes and I regret them.\"",
      "Friends and family members of the defendants and the two victims, including\u00a0Umberger's father, who traveled from the UK, attended the hearing, sitting on opposite aisles of the courtroom packed with about 100 people. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg also appeared at the sentencing and sat in the front row of the courtroom as victim statements were underway.",
      "Carlos Ramirez told the court that his brother, Julio, was his best friend who had \"just begun building his life\" and his career as a mental health counselor before his death.",
      "\"What happened to my brother wasn\u2019t just tragic, it was intentional\u2026it was evil,\" Carlos Ramirez said. \"What\u2019s worse, he was left alone while the people responsible continued their lives [and] my family was shattered.\"",
      "He then asked Judge Mennin to sentence the men to life in prison without the possibility of parole, arguing that they are a \u201cthreat to society.\u201d Ramirez's parents also spoke, reiterating the request for \"real justice.\"",
      "Umberger's mother, Linda Clary, told the court that losing her son is \"truly the greatest pain and worst pain in the world\" and that \"this was preventable and this should not have happened.\"",
      "\"I also know that one of the greatest things John taught is that every problem is an opportunity. And through this tragedy, there has been so much love,\" Clary said during her emotional impact statement.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Meghan Hast said Wednesday that after Umberger was murdered, he was left on the bed of his townhouse while Hamilton and DeMaio went on a shopping spree. At trial, prosecutors also showed a video recorded by DeMaio and Hamilton at the townhouse where Umberger was staying, celebrating near his body the night of the murder.",
      "\"I would like to pause for 13 seconds to acknowledge the video that was made while my son died, and you did nothing to help,\" Clary said in her victim impact statement.",
      "Prosecutors asked the court to sentence Hamilton and DeMaio to 40 years to life in prison and Barroso to 25 years to life in prison. Lawyers for the three defendants asked the court for a more lenient sentence and noted that they all plan to appeal the conviction.",
      "\"In this case, no one was supposed to die. That\u2019s the tragedy. No one intended to murder these young men,\" DeMaio's attorney, Dean J. Vigliano, said Wednesday.",
      "The crimes didn\u2019t come into broad public view until May 2022 \u2014 more than a year after the scheme began \u2014 when\u00a0NBC News reported on the mysterious death of Ramirez.",
      "Ramirez was found dead in the back of a taxi cab after encountering the men at the Ritz Bar and Lounge, a gay bar in the heart of Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.",
      "Umberger was found dead in a Manhattan townhouse where he was staying, days after he met two of the convicted men outside of nearby, and now closed, The Q. During the trial, prosecutors showed video of the men partying inside the townhouse alongside Umberger's unconscious body.",
      "Both men had a concoction of drugs in their systems, including fentanyl, lidocaine and cocaine, according to the city\u2019s medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "At trial, the defense argued that it was impossible to know which drugs killed the two men, pointing to the fact that some of the victims used illicit drugs recreationally.",
      "Once NBC News reported Ramirez\u2019s death, more gay New Yorkers stepped forward and shared stories of surviving similar encounters. Prosecutors said that the victims were not targeted solely for financial gain \u2014 not their sexual orientation.",
      "The New York City Police Department and the mayor\u2019s office\u00a0launched a program\u00a0in 2023 to re-examine unsolved drug, robbery, and homicide cases involving LGBTQ victims, following\u00a0criticism of the response from officials\u00a0from surviving victims. However, authorities maintained that the cases were correctly handled.",
      "Three other men, Eddie Ashley, Shane Hoskins, and Andre Butts, were also arrested and convicted of crimes in connection with the scheme. According to the district attorney\u2019s office, the three other men pleaded guilty.",
      "Throughout the same time period, a similar crime ring was wreaking havoc at bars in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, prosecutors said.\u00a0The second crime scheme also led to several deaths and at least one arrest."

      "Louisiana State Police announced the arrests of Cortnie Harris, 32, and Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, in a Wednesday news release. They were charged with one felony count each of accessories after the fact.",
      "Harris was allegedly in contact via phone with an inmate before the escape, police said. The inmate remains on the run.",
      "Harris is also accused of transporting two escapees to multiple locations in New Orleans. Those inmates have not been captured, the release states.",
      "Baptiste was allegedly in contact via phone and social media with inmate Corey Boyd, who was captured Tuesday night. Police said Baptiste provided food to Boyd as he hid inside a residence.",
      "It's not clear if Baptiste and Harris have obtained attorneys. They are being held at the Plaquemines Parish Detention Center.",
      "Their arrests came one day after Sterling Williams, a jail maintenance worker, was charged in connection with the escape. Ten inmates broke out of the Orleans Parish Justice Center early Friday. Five have not been captured.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said Williams aided in the escape by cutting off the water so inmates could pull the toilet from the wall and flee through a hole.",
      "A photo released by the sheriff\u2019s office last week showed a hole in the wall behind the toilet with phrases such as \"To Easy Lol\" and \"We Innocent\" written above it.",
      "An affidavit for an arrest warrant stated that Williams told authorities that an inmate threatened to shank him if he did not help. Initial information indicated the inmates used an \"unknown apparatus to saw steel bars\" behind the cell toilet, the affidavit said.",
      "The inmates then bent the bars, fled to an outdoor, unsecured pipe walk area and scaled a jail wall, the document stated. The affidavit said that without Williams' help, the plan would have failed.",
      "Michael Kennedy, a lawyer for Williams, said the affidavit is a \"mischaracterization\" and his client turned the water off because the toilet in an unused handicapped cell was clogged, not because he was aiding in their escape.",
      "\"What he stated is that one of the inmates standing there did say something in passing about shanking him. He did not consider that a threat,\" Kennedy said in a phone call on Wednesday. \"He's worked in the jail for the past five years. Inmates say things. He took it as nothing more than that. So when he was interviewed, did he report that? Yes, because it is a fact. But it\u2019s not a fact that led anywhere.\"",
      "Kennedy said it was a deputy who told Williams about the clogged toilet and instructed him to \"look at it.\" The deputy did not put in a work order for the clog, Kennedy said.",
      "Williams learned of the escape on Friday morning at \"the same time as the rest of us,\" his attorney said, accusing officials of using his client as a \"scapegoat.\"",
      "More than 200 law enforcement personnel are assisting in the search for the remaining escapees, officials said. The reward for information leading to the capture of each man has grown to $20,000."

      "Fears of a global government borrowing glut \u2014 likely to be compounded by the GOP's spending and tax cut bill \u2014 helped fuel an unusually weak auction for U.S. government bonds that sent markets into a tailspin Wednesday.",
      "The broad S&P 500 fell 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined more than 800 points, or 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was off 1.4%.",
      "Investors are increasingly worried that central banks around the world, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, will have to hold interest rates higher for longer. That scenario could help keep a lid on inflation, which can be fueled by rising levels of government spending.",
      "It's an issue ratings firm Moody's highlighted Friday when it stripped America's debt of its prime AAA status. While the market's initial reaction to the downgrade was relatively muted, a combination of fears of rising interest rates abroad and the impact from the budget bill sought by President Donald Trump sent bond investors over the edge Wednesday.",
      "Dubbed by the president as \u201cone big beautiful bill,\u201d the proposed legislation would extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts while raising the debt limit by $4 trillion. It would also boost spending for immigration enforcement and military, while making cuts to areas like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits.",
      "Third-party, ostensibly nonpartisan groups like the Congressional Budget Office and the Penn Wharton Budget Model have said the bill would fail to meaningfully address America\u2019s debt and deficit issues \u2014\u00a0assertions that White House officials have disputed.",
      "Bond investors may have the final say.",
      "A Wednesday afternoon auction for bonds that pay off after 20 years saw investors asking for a significantly higher return than they did for a similar auction a month ago, Dow Jones reported. The category of bidders for the bonds that include foreign central banks saw lower participation.",
      "That caused bond yields, or the percentage amount that investors demand in return for lending to the government, to surge. The yield on the 10-year note reached its highest level since February, climbing to as much as 4.6%, while the yield on the 30-year note reached more than 5%, its highest level in 18 years.",
      "When bond yields go up, it means governments have to pay more in interest \u2014\u00a0and have less money to spend on other areas \u2014 unless they borrow even more money, which risks igniting inflation.",
      "\"The market's queasy here with this move in rates,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group and author of The Boock Report newsletter.",
      "He said the likely contents of the final spending bill, plus the recent recovery by stocks after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement sent them plunging, make it increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated for the foreseeable future.",
      "That, in turn, means less money would be available to help bid up stock prices, Boockvar said.",
      "\"Investors have become highly sensitive to further rises in interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Wednesday's poor U.S. auction results were compounded by economic concerns about Japan and the U.K., whose central banks are facing increasing pressure to keep interest rates higher amid inflation and spending jumps. In the U.K., inflation jumped more than expected last month, while Japanese investors pushed the rate of return they demand to lend to that country to levels not seen in 25 years.",
      "The upshot is that investors worldwide are increasingly worried about governments' abilities to pay back their debts in a timely manner without forcing price growth throughout their respective economies to accelerate.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus were slated to meet with Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon to discuss the budget legislation."

      "Department of Justice officials on Tuesday\u00a0charged\u00a0members or associates of an Armenian organized crime ring with stealing more than $83 million worth of cargo from\u00a0Amazon\u00a0by posing as legitimate truck drivers and siphoning off goods destined for the company\u2019s warehouses.",
      "Since at least 2021, at least four people linked to the crime ring carried out a scheme across California to steal truckloads of merchandise, ranging from smart TVs and\u00a0GE\u00a0icemakers to\u00a0SharkNinja\u00a0vacuums and air fryers, the DOJ alleged.",
      "\u201cAt present, Amazon is plagued by recurring thefts of its shipments, which is commonly referred to as \u2018cargo theft,\u2019\u201d the complaint says.",
      "Amazon has ramped up its efforts to track and shut down\u00a0fraudulent, deceptive and illegal activities on its sprawling online store. Eliminating stolen goods is particularly challenging. CNBC reported in 2023 that Amazon\u00a0suspended dozens of third-party merchants\u00a0it alleged were selling stolen goods, though many of those sellers claimed they were unknowingly caught in the scheme, putting their businesses at risk of survival.",
      "Amazon isn\u2019t the only retailer afflicted by cargo theft.\u00a0Experts told CNBC\u00a0cargo theft-related losses are estimated at close to $1 billion or more a year.",
      "In its complaint, the DOJ said the alleged fraudsters operated four transport carriers \u2014 AK Transportation, NBA Holdings, Belman Transport and Markos Transportation \u2014 that would obtain contracted freight routes from Amazon Relay, an application used by truckers to obtain work, also referred to as loads.",
      "Each trucker is assigned a load for pickup from a manufacturer\u2019s warehouse to be dropped off at an Amazon facility. Instead, the groups would divert from their designated routes, take a portion of the goods off the trucks and resell them or gift them to associates, prosecutors allege.",
      "In some cases, the \u201cself-styled carriers\u201d would complete their deliveries at an Amazon warehouse several days after they were expected to show up, according to the complaint.",
      "DOJ officials seized the alleged fraudsters\u2019 iPhones and found photos and videos of warehouses lined with boxes of crockpots, Keurig coffee machines, keratin shampoo, Weber grills and other goods.",
      "Amazon teams cooperated with DOJ officials in their investigation, including sharing information about the stolen goods, and details of the alleged fraudsters\u2019 accounts on its online marketplace.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that the company has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for cargo theft and other forms of organized retail crime. Amazon relies on a mix of internal teams and technologies to prevent ORC schemes. The company has also referred \u201cthousands\u201d of ORC bad actors to law enforcement officials.",
      "\u201cThese referrals have resulted in arrests, product seizures and recoveries, and the dismantling of ORC networks in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "DOJ officials linked the defendants to a litany of other alleged crimes, including attempted murder, kidnapping, illegal firearm possession and health-care fraud. Several of the 13 defendants are expected to appear in a Los Angeles district court on Tuesday and Wednesday, while one of the defendants appeared in a court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Tuesday and was detained.",

    "story": [
      "After a deportation flight with eight migrants left Texas reportedly intended for South Sudan this week, a federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration had violated a previous order.",
      "District Court Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts said during a hearing that the Trump administration had failed to adhere to his injunction, issued in March, preventing individuals from being sent to a country other than their own without giving them an opportunity to raise fears of persecution or torture.",
      "The judge's ruling comes after the Department of Homeland Security confirmed during a press briefing Wednesday morning that eight individuals from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico and South Sudan were deported this week. According to the DHS, many of these individuals had violent criminal convictions, including murder and sexual assault.",
      "\u201cThe department\u2019s actions,\u201d Murphy said, \u201care unquestionably violative of this court\u2019s order.\u201d",

      "Government attorneys said that the migrants are still in ICE custody, and that the plane has since landed. They declined to share the location of the plane\u2019s final destination.",
      "Murphy, who relayed publicly the sequence of events leading to the deportation of these individuals after spending more than 30 minutes in a sealed proceeding, said the individuals were notified of their destination \u201csometime in the evening\u201d on Monday, outside business hours. He added that they left the ICE facility the next morning at the latest in the 10 a.m. hour and at the earliest before 9 a.m.",
      "Without sufficient time to consult an attorney or family members, the judge said that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for those individuals to \u201chave a meaningful opportunity to object\u201d to their deportation to a third country.",
      "The hearing comes after immigration attorneys told Murphy that at least two of their clients, from Myanmar and Vietnam, were allegedly deported Tuesday morning to South Sudan.",
      "It\u2019s possible one of the migrants, Nyo Mint, might have been diverted to his home country of Burma but his San Antonio-based immigration attorney Jonathan Ryan says he is still in the dark about where his client is right now and says he has been \u201cdisappeared.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have not heard from my client,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHow am I supposed to take their word that they sent him to Burma?\u201d",
      "Ryan says the government is acting as if due process is a privilege saying it\u2019s a problem \u201cwhen we stop doing due process for unpopular people.\u201d",
      "During a DHS press conference ahead of the hearing, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told reporters of the migrants that \u201cno country on earth wanted to accept them because their crimes were so uniquely barbaric.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin also criticized the court system.",
      "\u201cActivist judges are on the other side, fighting to get them back onto the United States soil,\u201d she said.",
      "South Sudan could be headed for another civil war. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar, ended five years of civil war. But earlier this year, violent clashes between the factions have ramped up once again.",
      "Earlier this month, Murphy blocked the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to deport individuals from countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos to Libya. Then, Murphy had reaffirmed his injunction on third country deportations in response to an emergency motion from the migrants\u2019 lawyers."

Others were seen wearing keffiyeh scarfs, which have become an emblem of Palestinian solidarity.",

      "Cheers from the crowd followed. Later, boos erupted when Shipman culminated her speech.",
      "No major disruptions took place during the ceremony other than the occasional jeers when Shipman or other school officials were mentioned.",
      "The scene reflected persisting tensions in the university, which has been the center of controversy following\u00a0protests decrying the Israel-Hamas war that started in 2023 and its devastating effects on Palestine's Gaza Strip \u2014 where an estimated 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began.

      "As Burger King enters the next phase of its\u00a0turnaround efforts, the fast-food chain is trying to lure families back to its restaurants with colored Whopper buns and kid-friendly movie partnerships.",
      "Starting Tuesday, the\u00a0Restaurant Brands International\u00a0chain will sell new menu items inspired by the \u201clive action\u201d remake of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon.\u201d The collaboration is more than just a one-time partnership \u2014 it\u2019s part of Burger King\u2019s broader strategy to lift U.S. sales.",
      "\u201cWhere we\u2019re really starting to lean in now that we\u2019ve made some progress in both operations and in our restaurants is on a family-first marketing strategy,\u201d Burger King U.S. and Canada President Tom Curtis told CNBC.",
      "Burger King\u2019s U.S. business has been in turnaround mode for more than 2\u00bd years. After falling behind burger rivals\u00a0McDonald\u2019s\u00a0and\u00a0Wendy\u2019s, the company announced plans to\u00a0invest\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in a comeback strategy to renovate its restaurants, improve its operations and spend on advertising. The chain even\u00a0bought its largest U.S. franchisee\u00a0with the goal of accelerating its restaurant remodels.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that there will be chapters to this as we go through time, and right now is this family strategy chapter, where we\u2019ve done enough work and transformed our restaurant operations to the extent that we\u2019re proud of,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting families back in, and we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re getting better retention when they do come back in.\u201d",
      "Curtis said focusing on families gives Burger King the opportunity to attract customers across age cohorts, from millennials to Generation Alpha, which is roughly defined as people born between 2010 and 2025. Plus, parents\u2019 avid use of social media means that word spreads quickly, giving the approach a leg up compared with targeting a single demographic that isn\u2019t as enthusiastic online.",
      "The limited-time themed menu items include the Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper, with a red and orange marbled bun; Fiery Dragon Mozzarella Fries, made with Calabrian chili pepper breading; Soaring Strawberry Lemonade; and the Viking\u2019s Chocolate Sundae, with Hershey\u2019s syrup and black and green cookie crumbles.",
      "Colorful movie history",
      "Movie collaborations aren\u2019t anything new for fast food \u2014 or Burger King. It was one of the first fast-food chains to lean into movie tie-ins. In 1977, the chain sold \u201cStar Wars\u201d drinking glasses ahead of the film\u2019s release.",
      "McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t far behind, following with a Star Trek-themed Happy Meal two years later, kicking off decades of movie, TV and toy tie-ins aimed at kids. More recently, the Golden Arches\u2019\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d across more than 100 markets sold out within two weeks in the U.S., about half the time earmarked for the promotion.",
      "In Burger King\u2019s more recent past, under Curtis\u2019 leadership, the chain has had two major partnerships: one with \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d two years ago and another with the\u00a0Addams Family franchise, timed for Halloween last year.",
      "Both of those menus featured Whoppers with thematic, colored buns, dyed using natural colorants, like beet juice or ube.",
      "\u201cNot having artificial dyes and colors is something that\u2019s been important to us for a while,\u201d Curtis said.",
      "Burger King use of natural dyes comes as artificial food dyes have come under fire from health-concerned parents. Following a push from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration recently\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes in food and drinks.",
      "The two previous collaborations also were Burger King\u2019s top-selling Whopper innovations, based on the number sold, according to Curtis.",
      "\u201cWhat we found in the Addams Family promotion specifically was, as we dug into the property, traffic was fairly flat, but sales were up,\u201d he said, attributing the sales growth to families, which have a higher average check than a solo diner or a couple.",
      "The expected sales lift from the \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d menu comes at a crucial time for Burger King.",
      "In its most recent quarter, the company\u2019s comeback\u00a0stumbled. The chain\u2019s U.S. same-store sales slid 1.1%, mirroring an industrywide slump as fears about the economy and bad weather kept diners at home.",
      "But Curtis is confident that Burger King is on the right track, pointing to the chain\u2019s relative outperformance compared with its two biggest competitors: McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s.",
      "\u201cI know that they\u2019re scrambling, and sometimes, frankly, copying some of the things that we do, which, you know, plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we see them doing that, it gives us more conviction to stay on course.\u201d",
      "Deep dive",
      "When the live-action version of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d hits theaters on June 13, it\u2019s expected to be one of the summer\u2019s big blockbusters. After all, the animated trilogy has\u00a0grossed more than $1.6 billion\u00a0worldwide.",
      "Burger King has similar expectations for its menu tie-in.",
      "The past success of the Spider-Verse and Addams Family menu items pushed Burger King to \u201cdramatically\u201d up its forecast for the \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d menu, according to Curtis. And Burger King is also planning on changing its advertising strategy, which could drastically increase demand for the Dragon Flamed-Grilled Whoppers.",
      "\u201cIn the past, we would just kind of associate ourselves with the movie property, but we wouldn\u2019t necessarily advertise the association \u2014 you\u2019d just see it and hear about it in social media,\u201d Curtis said.",
      "The promotion is supposed to run through early July, but in case Burger King burns through its supply in just three weeks, the chain is prepared to monitor what locations have run out of the menu items. That\u2019s a lesson it learned during its Spider-Verse promotion, when it had to launch a tracker on its website to help customers find the coveted Whopper.",
      "As it learns from every experience, Burger King is planning to dive deeper into franchise partnerships, betting that the extra effort will drive long-term loyalty for the brand.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing a couple more of them than we have in the past,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one toward the end of the year that we\u2019re very, very excited about \u2026 and we\u2019re getting some lined up for next year as well. In every one of those, we\u2019ll go all in.\u201d",

      "The world\u2019s\u00a0largest automaker\u00a0said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.",
      "Despite slower-than-expected\u00a0adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to\u00a0hybrid models\u00a0\u2014 which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines \u2014 to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.",
      "Toyota, which started offering hybrids with the\u00a0Toyota Prius in the late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.",
      "Toyota\u2019s electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. \u2014 including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles \u2014 accounted for 43.1% of the company\u2019s 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.",
      "RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.",
      "Sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models\u00a0reached a record 20%\u00a0of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.",
      "Hybrid-only",
      "David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.",
      "\u201cThe hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,\u201d he told CNBC on Tuesday during an event at the automaker\u2019s North American headquarters. \u201cIt was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.\u201d",
      "Christ said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.",
      "Seven of Toyota\u2019s current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.",
      "RAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of the vehicle\u2019s sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models \u2014 which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in \u2014 were 6.5%.",
      "The redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle\u2019s performance and technologies.",
      "The company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle\u2019s launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.",
      "The RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year\u2019s sales of the vehicle rose 9.3% year over year to a record \u2014 making it the bestselling nonpickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing\u00a0tariffs\u00a0of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.",
      "Toyota produces the RAV4 at a\u00a0plant\u00a0in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a facility in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.",
      "Roughly half of Toyota\u2019s U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.",
      "Mark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll work its way out. I think we\u2019ll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that\u2019s such a big volume car. \u2026 It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cNow we\u2019re bringing out one that\u2019s even better than that car. So, I think that we\u2019re going to need multiple plants to build that.\u201d",
      "Cox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other\u00a0third-party data firms\u00a0have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.",

      "Templin said the automaker has been conducting scenario planning for different tariff and production outcomes, but the situation remains fluid amid Trump\u2019s trade negotiations with other countries.",

    "story": [
      "In recent seasons, the \"tush push\" had become the NFL's most unstoppable play. On Wednesday, it even overpowered the group thought to be strong enough to finally stop it \u2014 NFL team owners.",
      "The quarterback-sneak play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles remains legal after a vote to ban it did not garner enough votes from owners at the league's spring meetings, held in Minnesota. Twenty-four of the league's 32 teams would have needed to vote to enact the ban. It was two votes short, per ESPN and NFL Network.",
      "The Eagles responded immediately after news of the vote with a two-word post on X: \"Push On.\"",
      "Though widely adopted, the play was most associated with, and utilized best by, its originator, the Eagles, who began trying different variations of the sneak in 2021 during coach Nick Sirianni\u2019s first season. In 2022, they debuted a version in which two or more players stationed behind quarterback Jalen Hurts pushed him forward, aiding his momentum.",
      "It played to the Eagles\u2019 strengths \u2014 namely, one of the NFL\u2019s best offensive lines and strongest quarterbacks \u2014 and helped them convert on reportedly 90 percent of short-yardage opportunities. It was a staple of their run to last season\u2019s Super Bowl title and even drew an endorsement from President Donald Trump, who said during Philadelphia's celebratory visit to the White House that he hoped the league would keep the play.",
      "Not everyone was a fan, however. It drew the ire of the Green Bay Packers, in particular.",
      "Packers president Mark Murphy called the play \u201cbad for the game\u201d during a question-and-answer story on the team\u2019s website in February. He wrote bluntly that \u201cthere is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less.\u201d",
      "This offseason, the Packers \u2014 who were 0-2 against Philadelphia last season, including a playoff loss \u2014 initially proposed a ban on plays that would assist players directly at the snap, only for team owners to table a vote in April. When owners gathered once again during more league meetings this week, the Packers re-submitted a tweaked, broadened proposal stating that no player may \u201cpush or pull a runner in any direction at any time or lift him to his feet.\u201d And no player would be allowed to \u201cassist the runner except by individually blocking opponents for him.\u201d",
      "Philadelphia brought retired All-Pro center Jason Kelce to Wednesday's meetings in an effort to lobby owners to keep the play legal, according to ESPN. Yet there was already momentum against the \"tush push,\" after the league's competition committee and the players' health and safety committee each voted to ban it, according to The Athletic. Owners, however, ultimately did not agree with the ban."

The rash normally begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.

      "The probe found that the platoon and SEAL Team 4 leaders did not adequately address the sailor\u2019s concerns about racist behavior and that the decision to revoke his qualifications was flawed.",
      "\u201cThis was a very shocking case of explicit and repeated racist memes directed at our client in a platoon-wide text thread,\u201d said Timothy Parlatore, the sailor\u2019s lawyer, referring to the memes shared over a Signal chat. \u201cThey modified his face in photos to look like a monkey and portrayed him as a chained slave on a slave ship, among others.\u201d",
      "The two enlisted sailors responsible for the memes face non-judicial punishment and punitive letters in their files. Both actions can be career ending, or can result in demotions or loss of pay. Other actions are still pending.",
      "The platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions, including disciplinary letters in their files, that could determine if they continue as SEALs.",
      "In a statement, Naval Special Warfare Command acknowledged the investigation into \u201cserious allegations of unprofessional conduct within one of our commands\u201d and said \u201caccountability actions are ongoing.\u201d",
      "It added that \u201cwe are dedicated to fostering a climate of dignity and respect, and after conducting a thorough and fair investigation, we will hold anyone found responsible of misconduct accountable.\u201d",
      "Parlatore praised Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, head of NSW, and his staff for taking swift action to \u201cinvestigate, reverse the negative repercussions that our client received, and move to hold people accountable.\u201d",
      "This is just the latest significant investigation into behavior issues and command failures at Naval Special Warfare Command. And it underscores racial concerns that are not new to the special warfare leaders.",
      "Commando forces across the services \u2014 particularly the officers \u2014 tend to be far less diverse than the military as a whole. And leaders in recent years have tried to attract a wider array of recruits in order to develop a more diverse force.",
      "Those efforts, however, could be threatened now, as the Trump administration and Defense Department leaders have made it a priority to end diversity and inclusion programs across the military and the government as a whole. That could exacerbate racist problems in the smaller, largely-white teams.",
      "As of March 2021, a full 95% of all SEAL and combatant-craft crew officers were white and just 2% were Black, according to Naval Special Warfare statistics provided to the AP. The enlisted ranks were only slightly more diverse.",
      "Those number are starkly different from the overall Navy population, where about 40% of the enlisted force and 24% of its officers are non-white.",
      "According to the defense official, the sailor filed more than a dozen specific complaints about racist behavior and about half were substantiated.",
      "And as Group 2 leaders began to look into the complaints, a second sailor \u2014 who is white \u2014 also complained about bullying by other platoon members. That amplified the broader concerns about the command climate and the later findings of leadership failures.",
      "Other recent investigations also found training and command problems.",
      "Last October a highly critical review found that two Navy SEALs drowned as they tried to climb aboard a ship carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen because of glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters.",
      "And in 2023, an investigation into the death of a SEAL candidate a year earlier concluded that the training program was plagued by widespread failures in medical care, poor oversight and the use of performance-enhancing drugs that have increased the risk of injury and death to those seeking to become elite commandos."

    "summary": "Gillian Flynn opens up about her imprint and writing process in a new interview.",
    "story": [
      "When Gillian Flynn sits down to write a book, she never knows the ending.",
      "Such was the case when the New York Times bestselling author wrote her thrilling novel-turned-film \u201cGone Girl,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Flynn is known for her twists, she says she's more interesting in making points about the human psyche and larger-scale world issues.",
      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",
      "Now, Flynn is working on screenwriting and also became a publisher herself, starting her own imprint, Gillian Flynn Books.",
      "Flynn chatted with TODAY.com about her books, her new imprint and the advice she'd give aspiring authors.",
      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",
      "I wasn't looking to have an imprint. But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacey Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators."

      "\u201cI think Willie (Geist) is one of the most amazing interviewers,\u201d Sara Hamlin, a longtime fan and Chicago resident tells TODAY.com at a reception ahead of Willie\u2019s Sunday Sitdown Live with guest Ina Garten on May 19. \u201cHe\u2019s just different than any other interviewer, and Ina is one of my favorite chefs.\u201d",
      "Along with her husband Scott, Hamlin flew into New York City just to see Willie speak with his friend Garten at City Winery at Pier 57.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel like I could actually cook,\u201d Sara says of the Barefoot Contessa, adding that she regularly makes her roast chicken recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list for me to be here to see two of my favorite people. We\u2019ve never seen her in person before.\u201d",

      "\u201cNails it!\u201d Simeon Pappas, her husband, chimes in. \u201cWhen she makes that, there\u2019s no chicken left at the end between the two of us, not when we have five friends over, either.\u201d",
      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",
      "Fans from as far as Canada made the journey to see Willie and Garten chat and do a short cooking demo, too \u2014 a kind of dedication that our host finds thrilling.",
      "\u201cIt still blows me away,\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com backstage. \u201cThese people out there feel strongly and passionately about our show, so let\u2019s bring them into the room.\u201d",
      "Garten walked onstage to Eartha Kitt\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d to an audience of more than 500 fans, who gave the francophile a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cLove the music,\u201d Garten said with a smile.",
      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",
      "During their sitdown, Garten spoke with Willie about her memoir \u201cBe Ready When the Luck Happens,\u201d dinner party no-nos, her relationship with husband Jeffrey and her Food Network show \u201cBe My Guest,\u201d which has welcomed such names as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jennifer Garner and Stanley Tucci.",
      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",
      "Garten and Swift have become close over the years, sharing mutual admiration. The cookbook author has previously shared that she first met the 14-time Grammy winner at TODAY. Later, their budding friendship was cemented when Food Network Magazine asked musicians who their favorite Food Network cooks were.",
      "\u201cTaylor chose me, which was so sweet,\u201d Garten said.",
      "Garten added that Swift has been to the barn \u2014 the Contessa\u2019s nickname for her East Hampton home \u2014 about 10 years ago, and they spent time in her kitchen.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna just stand there and take pictures of her,\u201d Garten said with a chuckle. \u201cI wanted to cook with her.\u201d",
      "She said she asked Swift\u2019s longtime publicist Tree Paine what the pop star likes to eat and was told the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer\u2019s favorites are Garten\u2019s mustard-roasted fish, filet of beef and date nut spice bread, but Garten ultimately decided against those options.",
      "\u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like Taylor Swift, that sounds like a Ukrainian grandmother,\u2019\u201d Garten said to laughter. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not gonna make any of those things.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, Garten decided to make pavlova. Her recipe tosses blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in a framboise-spiked berry sauce over a big meringue base.",

    "story": [
      "Rob McElhenney says he\u2019s considering switching to a shorter last name.",
      "The \"It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" star \u2014 who also co-owns the Wrexham A.F.C football team with Ryan Reynolds \u2014\u00a0 told Variety he wants to swap his notoriously challenging surname for one that's easier to pronounce.",
      "The decision, he said, coincides with his multimedia company, More Better Industries, increasing its global investments, which now includes soccer teams in Colombia and Mexico.",
      "\"As our business and our storytelling is expanding into other regions of the world and other languages in which my name is even harder to pronounce, I\u2019m just going by Rob Mac,\u201d he said.",
      "The actor told the publication he initially worried that a name change might be considered disrespectful to his Irish ancestry. That is, until he discovered others in his family had changed the name over the years.",
      "Last month, family members who celebrated his birthday with McElhenney confided they, too, were interested in a name change.",
      "Olson, who tied the knot with McElhenney in 2008, told Variety she and the couple's sons \u2014 Axel Lee, 14, and Leo Grey, 13 \u2014\u00a0weren't sure what to make of the idea.",
      "\u201cThe kids are really not happy about it, because they have that last name ... And so do I, legally!\" she said.",
      "\"Mac\" wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for fans and people in McElhenney\u2019s orb to remember. After all, he plays a pub co-owner named Mac on \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny\u201d and also co-owns a bar in Philadelphia, Mac\u2019s Tavern, in real life with wife and \"Sunny\" co-star Kaitlin Olson.",
      "McElhenney\u2019s name-swap idea comes more than two years after his prankster pal Reynolds created a music video for the actor\u2019s birthday to teach fans how to say his last name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Mackle-Henney, it\u2019s Mackle-Henney,\u201d Reynolds sings along with a roster of guest stars, including Olson and then-Philadelphia Eagle center Jason Kelce.",
      "In 2023, Olson, who also stars on the new hit ABC drama \"High Potential\"\u00a0and has a recurring role on the HBO hit comedy \"Hacks,\" poked fun at rumors that McElhenney had been cheating on her while in Wales.",
      "\"It was me who had the affair. But it was not someone from Wales. It was with a whale,\u201d Olson tweeted at the time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved whales,\" she added. \"They\u2019re the bosses of the ocean and I\u2019m attracted to power. We ask for privacy as we navigate this difficult time.\u201d",
      "McElhenney couldn't resist reposting Olson\u2019s tweet and adding his own joke. \u201cSad to admit that rumor is true,\" he wrote."

      "The essay itself is dense and sophisticated, exploring parallels between public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and strategies for confronting climate change. But tucked inside all that research is something more personal: a peek into the thoughts of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's eldest child.",
      "According to Violet, Garner was \u201cshell-shocked, astonished, at the scale of destruction\u201d wrought by the wildfires in the neighborhood where she is raising her family. Garner, 53, and Affleck, who divorced in 2018, are also parents to Fin, 16, and Samuel, 13.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at her surprise: as a lifelong Angelena and climate-literate member of generation Z, my question had not been whether the Palisades would burn but when,\u201d Violet wrote.",
      "The January, 2025 fires in the Los Angeles area killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "Violet, a rising sophomore at Yale, recounted growing increasingly frustrated with other adults who dismissed the crisis as if it were merely a \u201cburst of bad luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had come from a combination of high winds and low rains \u2014 what, my little brother asked, did global warming have to do with the speed of the wind?\u201d Violet wrote.",
      "\u201cHopefully, most of us understand the climate crisis better than my little brother,\" she later added.",
      "Violet's commitment to public health hasn't been confined to the classroom.",
      "In 2024, Violet delivered a passionate speech at a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting, pushing back against proposed mask bans in public spaces and healthcare settings. She spoke from personal experience, having dealt with a post-viral condition herself, and stressed how serious and long-lasting the effects of viral infections can be, especially for vulnerable communities.",
      "Violet also has a knack for language. When dad Ben Affleck appeared on TODAY in April, he described Violet as a \"student of Spanish.\" He studied the subject at the University of Vermont.",
      "\"She will tell me that hers is better than mine,\u201d the actor told Savannah. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad that I get the chance to be on national television and just claim victory!\u201d"

Moore also founded DNA Detectives, which helps people connect with their biological families \u2014 no \"Finding Your Roots\" needed.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Moore explained that much of her work doesn\u2019t make the episode. Each \u201cBook of Life\u201d takes hundreds of hours to create. The show tapes Gates\u2019 presentation of the book for about four hours \u2014 and the final edit is a fraction of that.",
      "Below, Moore shares more notable discoveries throughout her decade on \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "Henry Louis Gates Jr.",
      "Gates simultaneously asked Moore to work on his family secret that he\u2019d learned about at age nine, which Moore would be tasked with working on for the next decade. It culminated in one of the most satisfying \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d discoveries for Moore in the show\u2019s history, causing Gates to tear up during the filming while Moore hosted in Gates\u2019 place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful because his original family mystery is really what sparked all of this,\u201d Moore told TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if finding your roots would even exist if he hadn\u2019t been so intrigued with that mystery.\u201d",
      "The findings of the mystery, uncovered in the season 11 finale of the show, revealed the life surrounding Gates\u2019 great-great-grandmother Jane Gates, uncovering the husband of Jane Gates as well as estate papers showing her listed in slave records along with her two sons.",
      "Moore, who spent over a decade working on the project, learned the identity of Gates\u2019 great-great-grandfather Charles Wesley Kelly in 2017 thanks to the growth of public DNA databases online. Despite finding the identity of Kelly, she wanted to provide Gates with a full spectrum of information on his family tree.",
      "\u201cTrying to give my friend and my colleague information that would be valuable and meaningful to him, it was pretty daunting,\u201d Moore laughs.",
      "The result was worth the wait; Moore uncovered over 300 of Jane Gates\u2019 descendants who gathered for a Gates family reunion, a full-circle moment for the \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host.",

      "\u201cThat was tremendously concerning, because it\u2019s not something we would surprise him with on camera. That would not be kind,\u201d Moore recalls about the discovery.",
      "Ahead of filming, Gates called LL Cool J to see if he wanted to proceed, as is the show\u2019s policy. He insisted he wanted to discuss it on camera, and his mother agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little devastating to know that the guy that raised me, the guy that was so kind to me, wasn\u2019t my blood,\u201d LL Cool J said during the episode.",
      "Moore compared Griffith\u2019s DNA to a database of millions of available samples and found a match with a half sister named Claudia Lewis, sharing 24.7% matching DNA, which led to the discovery of LL Cool J\u2019s biological grandfather, Nathaniel Christy Lewis.",
      "Moore also discovered LL Cool J\u2019s maternal grandmother, a woman named Ethel Mae Jolly, quickly learning that Jolly was still alive in her late 80s.",

      "Manganiello\u2019s great-grandmother on his mother\u2019s side, Terviz \u201cRose\u201d Darakjian, was a survivor of the Armenian genocide. Nearly all of her family was killed, including her husband, parents and seven of her eight children.",
      "Using DNA evidence, Moore discovered Manganiello's grandmother became pregnant by a German soldier in a refugee camp after fleeing during the Armenian genocide.",
      "Then, on his father's side, DNA evidence revealed that Manganiello showed no genetic relation to the man he assumed to be his father\u2019s father. Manganiello\u2019s father had no idea he was not raised by his biological father, but agreed to share the findings on the PBS show.",
      "Manganiello eventually learned his biological paternal grandfather was of African American descent.",
      "Moore says that the countless discoveries made in the episode inspired Mangianello to continue research after the show, the first guest to become invested in genealogy afterwards.",

      "The Chicago native appeared multiple times in the recurring \u201cDa Bears\u201d sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in which a group of blindly devoted Chicago Bears fans, decked out in Bears gear, dark sunglasses and thick mustaches, discuss the team on a talk show, with many conversations punctuated by them saying \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in a thick Chicago accent.",
      "Officially known as \u201cBill Swerski\u2019s Super Fans,\u201d the sketch was a staple of \u201cSNL\u201d in the early 1990s, featuring the actors making outlandish predictions that the Bears will win games by completely unrealistic scores, their confidence oozing like the juices from the kielbasa they scarf down on the daily.",
      "Wendt, as Bob Swerski, would open the sketch, with cigar in hand, by casually announcing he\u2019s filling in for his brother, Bill, who suffered another heart attack. The panelists, of course, are surrounded by artery-clogging foods on the table around them; a heart attack is as natural a byproduct as quenching their thirst with a beer after eating the caloric explosion of cuisine set before them.",
      "Joined by Robert Smigel \u2014 who created the sketch \u2014 Mike Myers and Chris Farley, the quartet live on the fringe of reality. They believe nothing is better than the Bears and no one is better than their then-head coach, Mike Ditka. They speak as if their love for all things Chicago is fact.",

      "\u201c\u2018Da Bears,\u2019\u201d everyone else says while raising their mugs of beer.",
      "In another episode, the crew quickly discusses how many heart attacks they had that week before guest host Macaulay Culkin reenacts the first Thanksgiving, which somehow features his absurd pick for how badly the Bears will beat the Lions when they play during the holiday.",
      "Smigel came up with the premise of the sketch after seeing fans at Chicago Cubs games and Chicago White Sox games after he moved to the Windy City in the early 1980s.",
      "\u201cThey just had this swagger to them and I just, in my head, I was like, \u2018Da Bears!\u2019\u201d Smigel once told Antenna TV.",
      "\u201cThere was just a swagger among these very virile-looking men,\u201d he told The Ringer in 2018. \u201cAll sports fans kind of have it. The arrogance of, \u2018We kicked your ass!\u2019 No, you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re a fat guy sitting in the third row. You can barely make it to the bathroom with all the beers you\u2019ve drunk. You didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "Joe Mantegna appeared in the sketch the first time it aired. Wendt would step in for the second sketch later in 1991, a point in which Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their run of six NBA titles that decade. That marked a turning point for the sketch.",
      "\u201cAfter Wendt joined in, the Super Fans were officially recurring characters,\u201d wrote The Ringer. \u201cThat summer at a\u00a0Comic Relief event\u00a0in Chicago, the group appeared in a sketch with Michael Jordan.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what led to him feeling comfortable hosting\u00a0\u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u201d Smigel told the website. Indeed, Jordan did host the show\u2019s 17th-season premiere in September 1991.",
      "The sketch was a stalwart in the \u201890s, but lived on in the years afterward, too, with Wendt reprising his role on multiple occasions.",

      "The reality TV show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" delivered a gut punch in an episode centered around a TikTok trend known as \"pregnancy roulette.\"",
      "In this \"game,\" a group of women each take pregnancy tests and place them in a container. Then they pick up a test at random and announce whether it yields a positive or negative result.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, this game ended in tears \u2014 lots of them.",
      "Demi Engemann, who was in the middle of a lengthy battle with infertility at the time, picked out a positive pregnancy test that belonged to one of the other women. Holding the positive test that she'd yearned for but never gotten, she burst into heartbroken sobs.",
      "Cast members and viewers have been rallying to her side, even though Engemann emerged as the \"villain\" elsewhere in the series.",
      "\"Every single one of us is a mom in that room, and we could all feel her pain because she wants this so badly,\" cast member Whitney Leavitt tells TODAY.com. \"You could just feel the energy in the room, like, 'We feel it. We\u2019re here for you. We get it.'\"",
      "\u201cI just thought it would be a fun little game,\u201d says Layla Taylor, who instigated the game. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really have any hunches that anyone was pregnant or anything like that, and I didn\u2019t think that Demi would have the reaction that she did.\u201d",
      "Viewers who had undergone similar struggles have been posting the clip from the show on social media and including comments like:",
      "\"At 25, desperately wanting to be a mom and it just not happening has been truly one of the most unimaginable things I\u2019ve ever had to endure ... That was all so much to witness.\"\"I know Demi is not a fan favorite right now but this broke my heart.\"\"As someone who has battled infertility for four years as well, this gutted me. I wanted to hug her so hard.\"",

      "\"I know Demi is not a fan favorite right now but this broke my heart.\"",
      "\"As someone who has battled infertility for four years as well, this gutted me. I wanted to hug her so hard.\"",
      "On the show, Taylor breezed into frame with a bag of drug store pregnancy tests. \"I have a surprise! We're going to play a little game for breakfast. We're going to play pregnancy roulette!\" she said. (Taylor's period was late so rather than taking a test in private, she decided to make everyone take a test in the most public way possible.)",
      "\"This is a cruel prank because what if someone is and it's not me?\" Demi Engemann, who had been struggling with infertility for four years, said before playing the game. \"This isn't traumatic at all. I don't cry every single time I take a test and get a negative,\" she added sarcastically.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann said, \"I feel like I'm going to throw up. It's evoking all of these emotions in me and triggering me to my core. My least favorite thing to do is take a pregnancy test.\"",
      "Yet for some reason, all of the women agreed to play the game.",
      "Taylor and Mayci Neely happened to grab tests with negative results. Mikayla Matthews selected a pregnancy test that happened to be positive. But none of the women confessed to being pregnant. Then it was Engemann's turn to select a pregnancy test from the bowl.",
      "When she spotted the result, Engemann gasped, took a huge step back, covered her face with her arm and began to sob. The test was positive. But she knew it wasn't hers.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann described how unsettling it was to look at a positive pregnancy test.",
      "Though she asked for the pregnant women to reveal themselves, Matthews and Neely (who had previously announced their pregnancies on social media) remained silent.",
      "This situation was \"the exact opposite\" of how Neely said she wanted to reveal her pregnancy to the group.",
      "\"This is also my moment that I don't want to be taken away from me, and I also want to be sensitive to how (Demi is) feeling,\" Matthews said.",
      "Engemann's \"frenemy\" on the show, Jessi Ngatikaura, consoled her as she sobbed. Eventually Matthews and Neely joined the pair and confessed that they were pregnant. Engemann ended up apologizing for her negative reaction to their positive tests.",
      "In her press interview, Taylor tells TODAY.com that she spent time with Engemann afterward to try to console her, but the scene was edited out of the final episode.",
      "\"They didn't show me in the bathroom, both of us crying and me consoling her and being like, 'I'm so sorry that this just happened. I feel awful. I'm so, so sorry,\" Taylor explains. \"A lot of things are definitely taken out of context.\""

      "\u201cCheers\u201d star George Wendt, who died May 20 at the age of 76, left behind a legacy in the annals of TV comedy that is hard to equal, thanks to one word: Norm.",
      "Norm was the embodiment of the show's well-known theme song about a place \u201cwhere everybody knows your name and they\u2019re always glad you came.\u201d",
      "An alum of Chicago's Second City comedy troupe, Wendt, who played the perpetually underachieving barfly Norm Peterson on the classic sitcom, was one of the strings that held the show together. He was an accountant by trade, but a loyal patron of the bar, first and foremost, a man whose love for the watering hole superseded his career and his marriage to his never-seen-on-camera wife, Vera.",
      "Norm was the everyman, literally always at the ready with a joke. And nowhere was that more evident than when he walked into the bar. As Cheers\u2019 most frequent and dedicated customer, Norm was always greeted by other customers and workers with a buoyant \u201cNorm!\u201d when he entered, providing a monosyllabic setup for the joke to follow.",
      "There is no shortage of witty lines.",
      "\u201cWhat are you up to, Norm?\u201d Sam, played by Ted Danson, asks in one episode.",
      "\u201cMy ideal weight, if I were 11 feet tall,\u201d he quickly shoots back.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mr. Peterson,\u201d Woody Harrelson\u2019s na\u00efve Woody asks him in another episode.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going in Mr. Peterson,\u201d he nonchalantly replies.",
      "\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening, Norm?\u201d Sam once innocently asks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy, and I\u2019m wearing Milk Bone underwear,\u201d he casually responds as he saunters to his bar stool.",
      "The premise initially appeared in the show\u2019s pilot.",
      "\u201cGeorge Wendt entered for the first time and said, \u2018Afternoon, everybody!\u2019\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d co-creator and longtime director, James Burrows, wrote in his 2022 book, \u201cDirected by James Burrows.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, everybody yelled back, \u2018Norm!\u2019 Then Teddy said, \u2018What do you know?\u2019 And George said, \u2018Not enough.\u2019\u201d",
      "In that moment, a recurring bit was born.",
      "\u201cIt was really a straight line in the script, but it got this huge laugh from the audience,\u201d Burrows continued. \u201cI turned to my two partners and said, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re laughing not only at this joke but they\u2019re laughing at this character, the person saying it.\u2019 Right then I had a sense that we had something special.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers,\u201d which was nominated for a staggering 117 Emmy Awards and won 28, never lost its luster over its 11-year run, even as cast changes challenged its dynamic. \u201cNorm!\u201d was a constant, a warm blanket for viewers looking for laughs.",
      "\u201cNorm!\u201d became a signature greeting that Burrows said was created by Nicholas Colasanto, who played Coach on the show before his death prior to the fourth season. It was simple, effective and eventually, daunting to write.",
      "\u201cWe wound up with ten of the greatest seconds of sitcom history each week, every time Norm walked in and made a joke,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cThe Norm\u2019isms \u2014 the interchange when Norm walks into the bar in each episode \u2014 became harder and harder to write, because the audience expected so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d was an escape from the daily travails and aggravation of life. Norm was the poster child.",
      "\u201cEvery character wanted something or had some kind of problem, except for Norm, who was wonderful and essential in a different way, because he was the anchor for the group,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cBecause Norm was relatively happy and well-adjusted, everything was fine.\u201d",
      "Wendt\u2019s portrayal of Norm earned him six Emmy nominations, although he never won. It was a career-defining role for a man who took to comedy the way Norm took to beer. He enjoyed other success, including a recurring role on \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201d He also appeared in his own short-lived series, \u201cThe George Wendt Show,\u201d and had multiple uncredited appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the popular \u201cSuper Fans\u201d sketches, which wrought the phrase \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in the early 1990s.",
      "He even had supporting roles in \u201880s movies such as \u201cFletch\u201d and \u201cGung Ho\u201d and once even shared a screen with Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson\u2019s heavily hyped video for \u201cBlack or White.\u201d He was  also the uncle to comedy star Jason Sudeikis.",
      "Wendt was just plain funny, a linchpin in a \u201cCheers\u201d cast that was a linchpin in NBC\u2019s vaunted Thursday night lineup that featured hits like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and \u201cNight Court.\u201d There are no words to explain how valuable he was \u2014 except one: Norm."

      "The couple welcomed their first child, son Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024. Ever since, she told the publication she is \"learning a new version\" of herself.",

      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fought so hard to try to get people to understand me, or know who I am, or see me for me. And people just don\u2019t want to sometimes. And there\u2019s nothing you can do about that. I\u2019ve been in a position where I\u2019ve tried to tell my side of a story or correct a narrative or tell the truth of a lie and then they go,\u00a0\u2018Well, she\u2019s lying.\u2019 Imagine how trapping that feels.\u201d",

      "Four social media creators are making the leap from the super small screen to the conventional small screen.",
      "On May 19, Peacock is debuting four scripted shows through its emerging artist series, first created in NBCUniversal\u2019s Creator Accelerator Program. (Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY\u2019s parent company.)",
      "All four shows \u2014 \u201cThe Warehouse Phase\u201d from creator Charlie Curtis-Beard, \u201cThe Kouncil\u201d from creator Katie Florence, \u201cOlder Hotter Wiser\u201d from creator Serena Kerrigan and \u201cPeople Like Me\u201d from creator Daren Vongirdner \u2014 will be available to stream in their entirety.",
      "The creators also star in their respective shows, which riff off the content they are known for. In written statements to TODAY.com, the creators describe the leap from phone to television.",
      "\u201cSocial media is immediate. You\u2019re writing, producing, and editing in real time, often by yourself. Making a show is the complete opposite,\u201d Kerrigan says. \u201cIt takes time, intention, and a village. But the overlap is in the storytelling. Whether I\u2019m crafting a 60-second reel or a seven-episode arc, I\u2019m always thinking about how to connect through honesty, humor and a strong point of view.\u201d",
      "Julie Christeas, founder & CEO of Tandem Pictures, which produced three of the four shows, describes this as the future of content.",
      "\u201cAs content consumption demographics and mediums are ever-changing, producers must adapt to a landscape that is asking the question, where is the next generation of great artists coming from?\u201d she says in a statement given to TODAY.com.",
      "Javier Pons, chief content officer and head of Telemundo Studios, said the collaboration between Telemundo and Katie Florence for \"The Council\" reflects \"a broader industry shift toward spotlighting authentic perspectives and developing content that resonates with new audiences.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about all four shows.",
      "\u2018The Kouncil\u2019",
      "Created by: Katie Florence (@katieflorence), a creator known for videos where she acts out conversations between different parts of herself \u2014 her heart, her logic and so on \u2014 to process what\u2019s going on in her life.",
      "How Florence describes \u201cThe Kouncil\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a dramedy that follows a girl going through a breakup. She deals with it by having discussions with her personified emotions that she calls her \u2018Kouncil.\u2019\u00a0It shows how easily one can be persuaded by their own anxiety or how they can be naive listening to their heart instead of their logic.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from: \u201cThe inspiration came from a conversation I had with myself after being dumped abruptly out of nowhere. I wondered how I had missed all the red flags throughout our relationship and realized I wasn\u2019t thinking logically but rather emotionally. My heart saw what she wanted to see and ignored the glaring truth that this guy just wasn\u2019t that into me. I was hoping to get a better understanding of why I kept striking out when it came to my dating life and what pattern I was following.\u201d",
      "How making a show compares to making content for social media: \u201cContent on social media doesn\u2019t have to be taken as seriously. I can think of an idea, post a quick video and not think twice about it. When it comes to filming a show, one scene can be rewritten and discussed 30 different times before it actually becomes finalized. There\u2019s also a slight pressure when you put something on a big screen rather than a phone screen. It\u2019s suddenly looked at with a harsher eye. People tend to expect more from you. It\u2019s a bit scary.\u201d",
      "\u2018Older Hotter Wiser\u2019",
      "Created by: Serena Kerrigan, known for her series on dating and confidence-building. Her book, \u201cLet\u2019s F\u2014n Date,\u201d comes out in 2026.",
      "How Kerrigan describes \u2018Older Hotter Wiser\u2019: \u201cA road trip rom-com meets identity crisis with excellent lighting and even better breakdowns. It\u2019s funny, raw and just the right amount of unhinged. The story follows a woman who has built her entire persona around being confident, only to realize that confidence means nothing the moment she steps off the stage. It\u2019s chaotic, emotional and painfully real, even though it\u2019s completely scripted.\u201d",
      "What her followers can expect: \u201cMy followers know SFK, the Queen of Confidence. She\u2019s loud, direct, and doesn\u2019t apologize for who she is. That version of me definitely shows up in \u2018Older Hotter Wiser,\u2019 but you also see the vulnerability behind her. The fear. The confusion. The need to figure out who she is when no one\u2019s watching. The show blurs the line between character and creator, and that\u2019s intentional. It\u2019s not just about watching someone be confident. It\u2019s about watching her earn it.\u201d",
      "What the show taught her: \u201cThat I can do really hard things. There were moments I genuinely wasn\u2019t sure I could pull it off, but I kept going. This show stretched me in every possible way. It was a completely different muscle from making 60-second videos. It was more intense, more collaborative, and honestly, more fulfilling. Even though it took nearly three years in development and pushed me to my limits, the payoff was so much greater. To finally see something I dreamed up come to life with a team of people bringing their full talent and heart to it \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of work I\u2019ve always wanted to do. And now I know I can. This is just the beginning.\u201d",
      "\u2018People Like Me\u2019",
      "Created by: Daren Vongirdner (@darendarendaren), known for innovatively edited and moving videos about life.",
      "How Vongirdner describes \u2018People Like Me\u2019: \u201c\u2019People Like Me\u2019 is a show about going through life and the everyday emotions we all face.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from:\u201cThe inspiration came from the universe. From art. From life. Stories are happening everywhere \u2014 you just gotta look.\u201d",
      "How making a show compares to making content for social media: \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s just storytelling. The only difference, for me and my team, is the scale of the production. We normally spend the same amount of time producing the content, we are just used to it being released in a shorter and more frequent amount of time.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next him: \u201cI have some good ideas for Hollywood. I think us creators have so much to learn from the traditional ways but at the same time, we have a lot to offer too.\u201d",
      "\u2018The Warehouse Phase\u2019",
      "Created by: Charlie Curtis Beard (@charliecurtisb), a musician and rapper who shares original songs on social media.",
      "How Beard describes 'Warehouse Phase'?\u00a0\u201cTWP is a show where we peel back the curtain on what it means to be an artist and content creator.\u201d",
      "Where the inspiration came from: \u201cI got the inspiration from my friend who worked in a warehouse to make ends meet. What he really wanted to do was make films. When we were talking he said he was in his \u2018warehouse phase.\u2019 I took that to mean the phase of life where you have to struggle to make ends meet before doing what you really want to do.\u201d",
      "How does the show compares to his social content: \u201cI\u2019m a rapper in the show! So my fans will love to hear that I not only made all the music in the show, but put the full songs on all streaming platforms.\u201d",
      "What he's learned from the experience:\u00a0\u201cWork with your friends! I actually came back from the experience wanting to work with people more even on my solo content.\u201d"

      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",

      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",
      "More than 53,000 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 have been killed in Gaza in the resulting war, according to health officials in the enclave, which Hamas has run since 2007.",
      "Talks to end the war have stalled, even as many Israelis urge their leaders to bring the rest of the hostages home. Adi Alexander expressed reservations about the \u201cmixed messaging.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s just a political posture,\u201d he said of Netanyahu's plan for an expanded military operation. \u201cMy expectation is going back to the bargaining table, rising above politics and prioritizing human life.\u201d",
      "The Alexander family knows all too well the suffering of the hostages.",
      "Yael Alexander recalled how her son said he held on to hope in captivity, thanks in part to seeing glimpses of his family on the news.",
      "\u201cHe saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew we were fighting for him.\u201d",
      "Their fight culminated on Mother\u2019s Day with a call from Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s\u00a0special envoy to the Middle East, who told the Alexanders that Hamas would be announcing the release of their son momentarily.",
      "Yael said she immediately packed her things and got the next flight to Israel. Adi and their other children followed on a later flight.",
      "\u201cIt was perfectly timed, and everyone was together just one time,\u201d Yael said of Edan\u2019s release. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d",
      "Despite being a bit thinner, paler and weaker, Yael said, her son is the same as before he was captured, and in their first conversation since his kidnapping, he joked that he needs a tan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same laughter, the same smile, the same kind eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our boy.\u201d"

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his country's military was \u201cmoving toward full control\u201d of the Gaza Strip as its intensifying airstrikes and ground operation there killed dozens more people overnight.",
      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is famine,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will lose international support and won\u2019t be able to achieve victory.\u201d",
      "That decision came even as Israel moved ahead with plans for a new ground offensive, dubbed \u201cChariots of Gideon,\u201d after its security Cabinet earlier this month unanimously approved plans to\u00a0seize all of the Gaza Strip.",
      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",
      "Those killed in airstrikes added to what has become one of\u00a0the deadliest weeks\u00a0of the conflict since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March.",
      "In a statement Monday, Hamas said that the Israeli military had launched \u201chundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily, targeting residential neighborhoods and densely populated civilian areas.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The United Nations said Monday that 92% of homes in Gaza have already been destroyed or damaged, in a post on X, adding that \u201ccountless people have been displaced multiple times, and shelter is scarce.\u201d",
      "In footage captured Sunday by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, Israeli missiles struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens of others.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin did not achieve great strides on ending the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries.

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The head of American chipmaker Nvidia praised President Donald Trump\u2019s move to modify U.S. curbs on the export of artificial intelligence chips to China, saying Wednesday that the Biden-era controls were a \u201cfailure\u201d that had cost his and other U.S. companies billions of dollars in sales.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the United States rolled out a three-tiered system of export curbs on advanced chips aimed at regulating the global diffusion of AI, blocking China entirely. While Biden said the curbs were necessary to slow China\u2019s development of technology that could have military applications, critics said they could undermine U.S. tech leadership.",
      "The Trump administration said last week that it plans to rescind some of those curbs and replace them with its own restrictions.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Jensen Huang, said his company controls 50% of the market in China today, compared with almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration in 2021.",
      "\u201cAll in all, the export control was a failure,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of Computex, a top technology trade show in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, saying the curbs were based on the \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d assumption that the U.S. is the only source of AI technology.",
      "Huang, 62, said Chinese companies blocked from buying American products had instead turned to local sources such as Chinese tech giant Huawei, and that they had been spurred to make advances with as little outside help as possible.",
      "\u201cThe local companies are very, very talented and very determined,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development.\u201d",
      "Those companies \u201cwould love for us never to go back to China,\u201d he said, adding that China is home to 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers and has an AI market he estimated would be worth $50 billion by next year.",
      "Nvidia said last month that it would write off about $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips it had specifically designed for the China market to comply with previous curbs after the Trump administration said those chips would also be restricted.",
      "\u201cI really do hope that the U.S. government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market as soon as possible,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang, who was with Trump on his Middle East trip last week along with other tech leaders, lauded the president for his \u201cgreat reversal\u201d of Biden\u2019s policy, known as the AI diffusion rule, saying Trump \u201crealizes it\u2019s exactly the wrong goal.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe sees it very clearly that the race is on,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand if the United States wants to stay ahead, we need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, the ministry further accused the U.S. of \u201cabusing export controls to suppress and contain China.\u201d It pledged to invoke China\u2019s anti-foreign sanctions law against anyone involved in enforcing the U.S. move, slamming it as \u201ca typical example of unilateral bullying and protectionism.\u201d",

      "Also in January, three suspects allegedly planned an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in Senftenberg, but it never came about because of the earlier arrests of two of the men.",

      "In an annual report released Tuesday, the Federal Criminal Police Office said that the number of violent crimes with a right-wing motivation was up 17.2% last year to 1,488. That was part of an overall increase in violent politically motivated offenses to 4,107, an increase of 15.3%."

      "Taku\u2019s resignation comes at a time when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s government has been grappling with low approval ratings ahead of a pivotal Upper House election this summer and ongoing tariff negotiations with the U.S. NHK World reported that former Environment\u00a0Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto.",

      "While Japan\u2019s agriculture ministry has been trying to curb soaring prices by releasing\u00a0government stockpiles, the move has had little effect in reining in prices.",
      "Rice prices in around 1,000 supermarkets\u00a0nationwide reportedly climbed to an all-time high in the week ending May 11. Prices for a 5-kilogram bag of rice rose 54 yen week-on-week to 4,268 yen ($29.63).",

      "The spike in rice prices reflects the lingering effects of poor harvests last year, with domestic rice consumption being overwhelmingly supported by local production rather than imports, said HSBC\u2019s chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann.",
      "Straining the supply side issue is the fact that rice in Japan is produced mostly by elderly people running small farms, so they\u2019re not very efficient, said Sayuri Shirai, a professor of economics under Keio University\u2019s faculty of policy management, who added that the number of farmers is also dropping with the aging population.",

      "To make matters worse, demand for Japanese rice has\u00a0skyrocketed on the back of high tourist\u00a0footfall, the professor noted.",
      "The sharp increase in rice prices is also partly attributable to panic-driven hoarding by both households and businesses, said Takuji Okubo, chief economist of the Japan Risk Forum.",

      "\u201cThat is very high compared to the U.S. or Europe,\u201d said Shirai, who added that Japan\u2019s inflation picture has more to do with cost pressures that are mostly derived from food prices.",
      "\u201cThat is why a lot of consumers are very angry,\u201d Shirai said.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Indian author Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi won the International Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday for \u201cHeart Lamp,\u201d a collection of 12 short stories written over a period of more than 30 years that chronicle the everyday lives and struggles of women in southern India.",
      "The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London\u2019s Tate Modern.",
      "It is the first time the award has been given to a collection of short stories. Bhasthi is the first Indian translator \u2014 and ninth female translator \u2014 to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then.",
      "The stories were originally written in Kannada, which is spoken by around 65 million people, primarily in southern India. Porter praised the \u201cradical\u201d nature of the translation, adding that \u201cit\u2019s been a joy\u201d to listen to the evolving appreciation of the stories by members of the jury.",
      "\u201cThese beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories rise from Kannada, interspersed with the extraordinary socio-political richness of other languages and dialects,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIt speaks of women\u2019s lives, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power and oppression.\u201d",
      "The book, which beat five other finalists, is made up of stories written from 1990 to 2023. They were selected and curated by Bhasthi, who was keen to preserve the multilingual nature of southern India in her translation.",
      "Mushtaq, who is a lawyer and activist as well as a writer, told a short list reading event on Sunday that the stories \u201care about women \u2014 how religion, society and politics demand unquestioning obedience from them, and in doing so, inflict inhumane cruelty upon them, turning them into mere subordinates.\u201d",
      "The 50,000-pound ($66,000) prize money is to be divided equally between author and translator. Each is presented with a trophy as well.",
      "The International Booker Prize is awarded every year. It is run alongside the Booker Prize for English-language fiction, which will be handed out in the fall."

    "story": [
      "SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras \u2014 The United States sent 68 immigrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their countries Monday on the first government-funded flight of what the Trump administration is calling voluntary deportations.",
      "In the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, 38 Hondurans, including 19 children, disembarked from the charter flight carrying $1,000 debit cards from the U.S. government and the offer to one day be allowed to apply for legal entry into the U.S.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to increase deportations substantially. Experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return, but unlikely to spur high demand. The offer has been paired with highly-publicized migrant detentions in the U.S. and flying a couple hundred Venezuelan migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "Kevin Antonio Posadas, from Tegucigalpa, had lived in Houston for three years, but had already been considering a return to Honduras when the Trump administration announced its offer.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see my family and my mom,\u201d said Posadas, who added that the process was easy.",
      "\u201cYou just apply (through the CBP Home app ) and in three days you\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. The flight left Houston early Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s good because you save the cost of the flight if you have the intention of leaving.\u201d",
      "Posadas said he hadn\u2019t feared deportation and liked living in the U.S., but had been thinking for some time about going home. He said eventually he would consider taking up the U.S. government\u2019s offer of allowing those who self-deport to apply to enter the United States legally.",
      "In a statement about the flight Monday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \u201cIf you are here illegally, use the CBP Home App to take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home. If you don\u2019t, you will be subjected to fines, arrest, deportation and will never be allowed to return.\u201d",
      "Twenty-six more migrants aboard the flight were headed home to Colombia, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security statement.",
      "Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garc\u00eda said the Honduran government would also support the returning migrants with $100 cash and another $200 credit at a government-run store that sells basic necessities.",
      "Among the migrants arriving voluntarily Monday were four children who were born in the United States, Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Garc\u00eda, who met the arriving migrants at the airport, said they told him that being in the U.S. without documents required for legal immigration or residence had been increasingly difficult, that things were growing more hostile and they feared going to work.",
      "Still, the number of Hondurans deported from the U.S. so far this year is below last year\u2019s pace, said Honduras immigration director Wilson Paz.",
      "While about 13,500 Hondurans have been deported from the U.S. this year, the figure stood at more than 15,000 by this time in 2024, Paz said.",
      "He didn\u2019t expect the number to accelerate much, despite the Trump administration\u2019s intentions.",
      "Some would continue applying to self-deport, because they feel like their time in the U.S. is up or because it\u2019s getting harder to work, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be thousands of people who apply for the program,\u201d Paz said. \u201cOur responsibility is that they come in an orderly fashion and we support them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "ROME \u2014 Vice President JD Vance shuffled between presidents and prime ministers this week, tending to complicated relationships with U.S. allies and puzzling over two wars.",
      "But it was his meeting Monday with newly installed Pope Leo XIV that could prove to be most consequential on the world stage, Vance said in an interview with NBC News.",
      "As his SUV limo sped to the airport here at the end of a three-day trip centered around the first U.S.-born pontiff\u2019s inaugural Mass, Vance spoke of Leo as a key potential partner in President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine and in other conflict areas.",
      "\u201cWe talked a lot about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation,\u201d Vance said of the nearly hourlong audience he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had with Leo. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I do think that not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be really helpful and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together in Russia and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Vance, who is Catholic, said he found the pope to be \u201cextremely sweet.\u201d He described their conversation as substantive \u2014 a promising sign given how Leo had, in his previous service as a cardinal, signaled disapproval of Trump administration immigration policies. Hours after the audience, Trump issued a social media post suggesting Leo could be helpful in the Russia-Ukraine talks.",
      "\u201cWe have an American pope of the world\u2019s largest single religion \u2014 a guy who doesn\u2019t have an army, but who I think has an incredible amount of capacity to convene and to influence, not just Europe, but, really, the entire world,\u201d said Vance, riding in the backseat alongside second lady Usha Vance as their motorcade delivered them to Air Force Two for their return to Washington.",
      "\u201cI hope it\u2019s the beginning of a very good relationship, because I think he does care a lot about peace,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there is a single most productive thing [from the trip], my hope is that it will be that the relationship between us and the Vatican leads to a lot fewer people getting killed and a lot less humanitarian disaster.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Vatican acknowledged \u201can exchange of views on some current international issues, during which hope was expressed that humanitarian law and international law be respected in areas of conflict and that there be a negotiated solution between the parties involved.\u201d",
      "This week\u2019s diplomatic efforts underscore the large foreign policy role Vance has carved out in Trump\u2019s administration. Trump has shown a limited appetite for travel in his second term. The president\u2019s recently completed Middle East visit was his first major overseas trip and only his second when counting his attendance last month at Pope Francis\u2019 funeral, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Vance, who met briefly with Francis\u00a0 the day before his death, has now been to Italy twice as vice president. He has also visited India, represented the White House at conferences in Paris and Munich and touched down in Greenland to reinforce Trump\u2019s interest in annexing the island from Denmark. And the White House nearly sent Vance from Rome on a last-minute mission to Israel \u2014 which Trump skipped on last week\u2019s tour \u2014 but said the logistics could not be worked out in time.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a particularly deliberate strategy of him traveling less or me traveling more,\u201d Vance said, weighing his globetrotting against Trump\u2019s. \u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s fallen.\u201d",
      "But Vance acknowledged that he has been given a broad portfolio and wide latitude.",
      "\u201cI definitely think the president has a lot of trust in me, and I\u2019m honored by it, and I think it makes me a more effective vice president,\u201d Vance said. \u201cA lot of people always asked me between the election and the inauguration: What would my role be? I would always say \u2026 I think it\u2019ll be being an extra set of eyes and ears for the president, doing the things that he thinks that I need to do, and that\u2019s largely how it\u2019s worked out.\u201d",
      "There was plenty for Vance to do in Rome.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s Mass, he and Rubio hosted Zelenskyy at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence here. A February clash between Vance and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office seemed like a distant memory when the vice president\u2019s office released a statement about \u201ctheir shared goal of ending the bloodshed\u201d and a photo of the two leaders smiling.",
      "From the Zelenskyy meeting, Vance hustled to Chigi Palace, where Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had brokered a meeting between Vance and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The sitdown was framed as an opportunity for constructive dialogue at a time when Trump\u2019s tariffs and Vance\u2019s adversarial posture toward European leaders have rattled the Continent.",
      "\u201cObviously, the president has had some pretty tough words \u2014 I guess I have, too, pretty tough words for Europe \u2014 about the importance of opening their markets, but also the importance of doing more burden-sharing in defense,\u201d Vance said in the interview. \u201cAnd I would say that one leader that both of us have consistently found is a really helpful bridge between the United States and Europe is Meloni.\u201d",
      "Meloni, like Trump and Vance, is known for her far-right politics. Vance observed that she has two qualities that he believes make her a strong diplomatic partner.",
      "\u201cThe first is that she\u2019s a very, very good listener. So if you have two people who really disagree on something, she tries to understand where both of them are coming from, and she\u2019s perceptive and insightful enough that she actually understands it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second thing is, she\u2019s extraordinarily direct. She actually reminds me a little bit of Usha in that way, where she can deliver an extraordinarily direct message without coming across as offensive. That\u2019s just a skill, right? There\u2019s a skill in actually being direct with somebody but not raising their guard.\u201d",
      "Vance also met Sunday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and with British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He said his discussions with Carney centered on trade policy, a major issue between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "Diplomacy to this degree wasn\u2019t originally on the agenda for Vance\u2019s return to Rome.",
      "\u201cWhen we first started sketching out the trip, I thought, oh, this is kind of nice. We\u2019ll go to the papal Mass, Usha and I will have lunch afterwards, and just kind of take it easy on Sunday and fly home Sunday night or Monday,\u201d Vance, who had just finished a leisurely lunch with the second lady, said before clarifying that he looks for opportunities to \u201cdo as much as I possibly can\u201d on taxpayer-funded trips overseas.",
      "\u201cIt was a very personally rewarding trip,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you\u2019re here and there are all these other world leaders here, you might as well try to try to sit down with them and talk to them.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s expansive role has placed him alongside Rubio, the administration\u2019s chief diplomat, as a face of Trump\u2019s foreign policy. The president stoked speculation of a 2028 rivalry between the two earlier this month when, in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d he suggested both as potential successors.",
      "At the time, allies of both Vance and Rubio dismissed any notion of competition or friction. Vance did so himself Monday, mentioning a recent conversation with a political consultant.",
      "\u201cI can just feel it \u2014 the media is going to start telling some story of me versus Marco or me having a rivalry with Marco,\u201d Vance recalled telling the consultant.",
      "\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Vance said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a s--- about this stuff. I don\u2019t even think that much about it.\u201d",
      "He and Rubio, Vance added, talk five times a day \u2014 \u201con a light day.\u201d If there\u2019s a call Vance knows Rubio will be on, he said, he knows he can skip the call and catch up with him later.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the level of trust and confidence that I have in Marco,\u201d Vance said.",
      "\u201cMy attitude is, if I do end up running in 2028, I\u2019m not entitled to it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I really think that Marco and I can get a lot done together over the next few years. That\u2019s how I think about our friendship and our relationship. And I would be shocked if he thought about it any differently.\u201d"

      "\u201cEven [if] the political things are not steady ... I\u2019m very confident about our product for the moment,\u201d he told CNBC, adding he anticipates \u201cvery fast\u201d growth in the U.S. in coming years. That includes his bold predictions that Bc Babycare\u2019s flagship baby carrier can become the best-seller on Amazon.com in half a year, and that U.S. sales can grow by 10-fold in a year.",
      "The $159.99 carrier, eligible for a $40 discount, already has 4.7 stars on Amazon.com across more than 30 reviews. The device claims to reduce pressure on the parent\u2019s body by up to 33%. A far cheaper version of the baby carrier is a top seller among travel products for pregnancy and childbirth on JD.com in China.",

Last week, the two sides agreed to a 90-day pause for most of the new duties in order to\u00a0discuss a trade deal.",
      "Baby gear is particularly sensitive to tariffs since the majority of those sold in the U.S. are made in China, said U.S.-based\u00a0Newell Brands, which owns stroller company Graco, on an April 30 earnings call. That\u2019s according to a FactSet transcript.",
      "The company said it raised baby gear prices by about 20% in the last few weeks, but had not incorporated the additional 125% tariffs announced in mid-April. Newell said on the call it had about three to four months of inventory in the U.S., and had paused additional orders from China.",

      "A long-lost memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the legendary frontman of The Doors, has been recovered 37 years after it was stolen, French police said.",
      "Crafted in 1981 by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Morrison\u2019s death, the bust was defaced with graffiti and messages by fans at the gravesite in Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, which is also the final resting place of French singer Edith Piaf and the Irish author, poet and playwright Oscar Wilde.",
      "Seven years later someone took it from the cemetery, which has become a pilgrimage for fans of Morrison, who was known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants and theatrical stage presence.",
      "The singer propelled The Doors to several major hits from 1965 to 1967, including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cHello I Love You,\u201d \u201cTouch Me\u201d and \u201cRiders on the Storm.\u201d",
      "Almost six decades on, the sculpture was found during an unrelated search, France's Financial and Anti-Corruption Brigade said Friday in a statement on Instagram.",
      "A representative for Morrison\u2019s estate told Rolling Stone that it was \u201chappy to hear the news\u201d of the statue\u2019s recovery. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a piece of history, and one Jim\u2019s family wanted there on his grave, so it\u2019s gratifying to see that it\u2019s been recovered.\u201d",
      "Born in 1943 in Melbourne, Florida, Morrison said he witnessed the aftermath of a terrible car accident on a Native American reservation as a child, an event that loomed large in his later lyrics and poetry.",
      "He founded The Doors with keyboardist Ray Manzarek in 1965, and guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band released their eponymous debut album \u201cThe Doors\u201d and \u201cStrange Days\u201d in 1967 and \u201cThe Soft Parade\u201d the following year. They followed this up with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in 1970.",
      "But the band would burn out quickly as Morrison sank into alcoholism. He was twice arrested for his on-stage antics, including a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity. He received a\u00a0posthumous pardon\u00a0in 2010.",
      "Morrison made his final album with The Doors, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d in 1971, and moved to Paris soon afterward.",
      "There, on July 3, 1971, he was found dead in a bathtub. He was 27. No autopsy was performed and accounts of what caused his death are disputed."
